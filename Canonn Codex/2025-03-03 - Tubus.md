*Highly specialised organisms that can grow to extreme heights, which peak when in a mature state. The organisms’ height and ability to survive is largely constrained by gravity. The lack of any real atmospheric weather has not put evolutionary pressure on the towers to be strong, so they form tall but thin structures which cannot be supported in high-gravity environments. The tower is formed from wrapped leaf-like structures, which create a regulated chimney void. This is used by the organism to create and maintain an artificial internal atmosphere, where discrete chemical processes can be undertaken along the length of the tower. Waste gases and other material may be released from the top of the tower. Some species feature external rings that can be used to gauge an organism’s age.*

*Due to their fragile structures Tubus prefer open plains but are tolerant of light undulation, low-lying rocky protrusions or the lowest levels of gentle slopes .*
