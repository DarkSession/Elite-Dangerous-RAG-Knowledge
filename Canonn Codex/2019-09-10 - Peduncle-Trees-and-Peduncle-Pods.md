Published: 10 Sep 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/peduncle-trees-and-peduncle-pods/)

Content: There are several varieties of Peduncle Trees and their associated pods to be found around the galaxy – notably in the Dryman’s Point, Sagittarius Carina Arm sectors. They appear inside Notable Stellar Phenomena. Look for the largest concentration of signals inside the phenomena and you should find them.

In-game codex information shows that the different variants appear near different planet types, and have different requirements for Star Types – more can be found in the game codex.

Space lifeforms often have discoverable traits – scan them with the Composition Scanner when they are doing something to reveal the traits. For Peduncle Pods these are the traits:

- Retreats rapidly is approached (with lights on)

Pods can be sampled using Research Limpets and can return one of Pod Dead Tissue, Pod Surface Tissue and Pod Core Tissue.
