Content: The Sanchez-class is a class of Science Vessel.

The class consists of two large cargo pod modules, connected to a power conduit as the center axis. Both cargo pod modules have a command module in direction of travel, and two two-engine modules at the rear.  The central axis has a single engine module at the rear, and in direction of travel two connected rotating habitat rings. The Ship Log Uplink is generally mounted on the central axis. Cargo pod modules have one or two Cargo Bays, and a total of eight turrets along with a Hackable Data Transmitter at the rear and a Hackable Comms Array at top.

Its default cargo of around 500 tons is Chemicals, Industrial Materials, Medicines, and Technology.
