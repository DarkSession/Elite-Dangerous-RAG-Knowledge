## Logs

* * *

> 
> **DON’T PANIC! 1/4**
> Governor Tanaka to Mrs Tanaka – 8723
> 
> My love, I can’t tell you how relieved I am that my term is almost over. This place has been a nightmare. I’ve had to deal with an overworked security force, underpaid administrative staff, a volatile population and the constant threat of strikes from municipal workers. Add to that the panic surrounding these reports of mysterious ships, and I’m just about at my limit.
> 
> Only two weeks to go. Two more weeks, and I won’t give this place a second glance. I can’t wait to be with you again.
> 
> Until then.

> 
> **DON’T PANIC! 2/4**
> Governor Tanaka to Mrs Tanaka – 8728
> 
> As if the mood in the settlement wasn’t tense enough, some pilot just made an emergency landing outside our perimeter. He was babbling about some strange craft in the system.
> 
> He came In hot, his hull covered with laser scarring. When they brought him in for debriefing he was screaming like a madman. Something about aliens returning to human space? I didn’t even know they’d been here before. 
> 
> Rumours of his report have already reached the civilian population. They’re clamouring for me to organise a mass evacuation, and are threatening to revolt if I don’t. As if I didn’t have enough to worry about!
> 
> I hate to burden you with this my dear, but you’re the only one I can confide in. This will all be over soon, I promise.
> 
> Until then.

> 
> **DON’T PANIC! 3/4**
> Governor Tanaka to Mrs Tanaka – 8731
> 
> There was a riot last night. I’ve put all security teams on high alert. I should have taken the threats of a revolt more seriously. At least it didn’t spread beyond the civilian quarter. Only minor injuries among the security forces, who managed to quell the uprising with non-lethal measures.
> 
> In light of this I’ve decided to accede to their request and order an evacuation of the settlement. It’s a logistical nightmare, and it might mean I have to stay on past my resignation date. But once it’s done I’ll be home free. I promise.

> 
> **DON’T PANIC! 4/4**
> Governor Tanaka to Mrs Tanaka – 8734
> 
> The settlement has come under attack. It seems that the pilot wasn’t crazy after all. I saw one of the ships as it flew overhead. Whatever is attacking us is definitely not human.
> 
> Much of the population has already gone, but I ordered an emergency evacuation all the same. There’s just me and a few civilians left. We’re about to head to the hangar now.
> 
> Even if I have to fly the ship myself, I promise I will see you again.
> 
> Until then.
