Content: Thargoid (previously Unknown) Probes are one of the three items required for activating [the device](https://canonn.science/codex/the-unknown-device/) within the [Unknown Structure](https://canonn.science/codex/the-unknown-structure/) sites, and by far the rarest of the three. Locating one will require a degree of patience and tenacity on behalf of the commander. The page on [Thargoid Probes](https://canonn.science/codex/unknown-probe/) has options for finding them (previous methods that were listed on this page will no longer work, so have been removed from our codex).
