## Shalatucas Civilian Broadcast

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/shalatucas-civilian-broadcast/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Lie Zhonpon system, orbiting body  3. 

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be on the hour, every 4 hours, with transmissions reported at: 00:00 / 04:00 / 08:00 / 12:00 / 16:00 / 20:00. 

The transmitted message is the following:

> 
> 19 21 18 22 5 25 9 14 7
> (repeated four times)

Decodes by letter positions to:

> 
> SURVEYING

This message is the decryption key for an encoded Galnet article in the local Herald:

The message consists of a series of words that can be interpreted as the NATO phonetic alphabet, yielding the message:

> 
> AOJRJWBLJA-CENBIEEA-QGECHJHLT-TUECJWGDE-UTAAGKREWCTBKRE

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of SURVEYING taken from the beacon yielded the message:

> 
> SHALATUCAS-REFUGEES-KIERNANCO-OPERATIVE-POSSIBLETROUBLE

This leads to a “Civilian Broadcast Detected” signal source in the Shalatucas system, orbiting body 2. This appears to be a permanent refugee convoy identical to the temporary ones seen in other systems during periods of Outbreak.

It contains a large convoy of multiple types of haulage vessel carrying refugees away from a nearby viral outbreak.
