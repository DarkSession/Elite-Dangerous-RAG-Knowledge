Published: 14 Oct 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/riker-class-prison-ship/)

Content: The Riker-class Reformatory is a class of Prison Ship.

The class consists of a central cell block module at the front, flanked by two additional cell block modules mounted directly against it both with a dual-engine drive module at the rear. Each of those cell blocks with a drive module also house two Cargo bays, defended by a single Automated Defense Turrett each. The central cell block module is followed by an additional cell block module mounted inverted, on the top of which are four agricultural domes, plus a command module mounted perpendicular to the apparent front of the ship. Below the Commandmodule a fifth cargo Bay can be found with a defending Turrett. At the back are two dual-engine drive modules.

Its default Cargo of around 650 tons is Chemicals, Legal Drugs, Personal Effects and Weapons.

The Ship Log Uplink is generally mounted on the inverted cell block module, just to the rear of the command module.
