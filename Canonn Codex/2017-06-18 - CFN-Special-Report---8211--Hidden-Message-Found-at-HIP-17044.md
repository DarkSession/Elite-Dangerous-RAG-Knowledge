Content: After continuing detailed study of the site at **HIP 17044** Canonn Research is confident in revealing further information about the incident. Cmdr **CrescentMage** and Cmdr **Tanall** noticed that from one of the Farraguts there seemed to be some sort of **EM discharge** that was being picked up in the audio band. This turned out to be a time delayed radio transmission, an **encrypted modulated sound** which Cmdr **AdmlAdama** was able to slow down, isolate and extract a hidden **Morse Code** message revealing the unfortunate shipâ€™s final moments.
