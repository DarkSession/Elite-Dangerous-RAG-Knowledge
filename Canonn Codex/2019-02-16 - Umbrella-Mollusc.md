## Umbrella Mollusc

Published: 16 Feb 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/umbrella-mollusc/)

Content: There are several varieties of Umbrella Mollusc to be found around the galaxy – they appear inside Notable Stellar Phenomena. Look for the largest concentration of signals inside the phenomena and you should find them (if they are present) – they are larger than most molluscs, so can often be spotted from a distance.

In-game codex information shows that the different variants appear near different planet types, and have different requirements for Star Types – more can be found in the game codex.

Space lifeforms often have discoverable traits – scan them with the Composition Scanner when they are doing something to reveal the traits. For Lindogoticum Umbrella Molluscs these are the traits:

- Releases spores if approached without lights on

If you have Research Limpets some varieties can be sampled and various type of sample are returned (Mollusc Spores, Mollusc Membrane and Mollusc Mycellum). There are no known uses for these. The samples are not corrosive.
