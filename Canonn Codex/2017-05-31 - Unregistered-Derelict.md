## Logs

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground, and next to the derelict there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

Around the derelict there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives detail about a previous investigation, may you be luckier:
(Note: There are only three logs to collect, scanning the fourth uplink will give you an “already accessed” message.)

> **DERELICT 1/3**
> Hey, Janey, come check this out! Looks like we’ve struck the jackpot. I told you there was something out here.
> 
> What is it?
> 
> A ship. Looks like it’s been here a while. Someone must have crashed and used it as a shelter. Look, they’ve made buildings out of the wreckage. We’ve got to check this out. Who knows what salvage will be in there.
> 
> I don’t like it, what if someone’s still in there?
> 
> Relax. If there’s someone there, maybe we can trade with them. Come on let’s check it out.

> **DERELICT 2/3**
> This place gives me the creeps. Can we go back to the SRV now? We’ve had a look around and no one’s home.
> 
> Are you kidding me? That’s the best part, we can take anything we like. We need to get to the bridge to see if we can get this thing running again. The ship still has power, the emergency lights are still on and the doors work.

> Maybe we could fix it up and have second ship. That would be so great, but you’re flying this one. It still gives me the creeps.
> 
> Got it. Let me just see if I can override these security measures and we’ll be golden.
