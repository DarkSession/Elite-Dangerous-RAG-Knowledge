> **THE LUCKY FEW 1/3**
> Crew Log:
> 
> I knew when I signed up for this expedition that we were not coming back.
> But It was not meant to be like this. I guess we can be considered lucky, after all if this had happened in deep space we would have been dead in seconds.
> 
> Now that it’s happened, l don’t know, i can’t stop thinking about the crash.
> I thought I was lucky to survive, but Thomas was the lucky one. At least she didn’t have to watch as we all keel over one by one down here.

> 
> **THE LUCKY FEW 2/3**
> Crew log:
> 
> I keep thinking of my mother’s last words before I left.
> “Be careful. It’s dangerous and no one knows what’s out there.”
> How right she was.
> 
> Oh well, nothing to do now but sit back, enjoy the view and hope for a rescue before our air runs out. 
> And it is a really nice view.

> 
> **THE LUCKY FEW 3/3**
> Crew log:
> 
> We’ve seen so much out there. Some of it beautiful, some terrifying.
> I know this is the end, but I wouldn’t have changed it for the world.
> If anyone finds this, please use the data we’ve collected for a good cause. I’d hate to think we wasted our time out here.
