## The Ace of Dalfur

Many have questioned **Canonnâ€™s** recent move joining forces with the **Anti-Xeno Initiative** and directly supplying intelligence to aid the battle for the bubble against the Thargoids. Rest assured that our primary focus is first and foremost **science**.

With humanity under **threat**, we are honour bound to apply our analytical **talents** to save as many lives as possible.. However the Anti-Xeno Initiative will be **fighting** the scouts with or without us, so our information sharing agreement enables us to get access to large quantities of Thargoid materials for **study**.

For instance the **propulsion elements** recovered from destroyed scouts could hold the key to more advanced **frameshift** technology.

It is tragic that these **ostensibly beautiful** Thargoid creatures have to be **destroyed** in the process but if they are not held back then **mankind** would be overrun. It is essential then that these creatures, if indeed they are creatures, be killed as quickly and **humanely** as possible to minimise their suffering.

No commander has been more **successful** at gathering Thargoid materials than **Commander JohnTAss** and none more humane. In the defence of **Dalfur** he has dispatched ***over a thousand Thargoid Scouts*** reducing them to their components in as little as 10 seconds in some cases.

Independent pilot ***CMDR JohnTAss***â€™ ship **Permethrin** is an engineered **python** running 4 Turreted AX Multi-Canons and one standard. We asked him to share his build and his thoughts on its performance:

> 
> I started out with a chieftain but I wanted to get faster kills, so I tried an FDL but I didnâ€™t like the lack of hull so I moved to the python. To kit it out I just moved the HRPâ€™s and utilities of the chieftain modules.
> 
> 
> Itâ€™s basically a AX multicannon build.There are a lot of core components that are way more than needed in this build, but I use the python for lots of things. Also, this is in no way an optimized build, itâ€™s a lot of parts that I had laying around. ðŸ™‚
> 
> 
> I really like this build on the python, in that pip management was easy and the dps was pretty good. I keep the pips 3.5 in sys, 2 in eng, .5 in wep. Also, the turret placement on the python allows a huge time on target. Usually, the scouts get killed fast enough that they donâ€™t fire missiles, but if they do I try to outrun them. Sometimes, I just tank the hit and burn it off at the end of combat.
