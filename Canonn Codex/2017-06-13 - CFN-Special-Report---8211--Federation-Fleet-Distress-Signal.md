## CFN Special Report &#8211; Federation Fleet Distress Signal

Published: 13 Jun 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/news/cfn-special-report-e3-event-2017/)

Content: During a live CFN stream Cmdrs **HSKelvin, Jonte** and **Artimus Tau** working in conjunction with Cmdr **Yamiks** were able to track down and analyse what seems to be the location of an intense altercation between capital Federation fleets and what we rightly assume are the telltale signs of **Unknown Ships**. Head to system **HIP 17044**, go to Planet 2 and then align to Asterope and travel approx 11,000 light seconds and look out for a **Distress Signal**. A transmitter within the wreckage contains a chilling message.
