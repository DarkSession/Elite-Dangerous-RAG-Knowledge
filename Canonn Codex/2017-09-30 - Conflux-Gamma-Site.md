## Conflux Gamma Site

Published: 30 Sep 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/conflux-gamma-site/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Pru Aescs OI-K a64-0 system, orbiting body 1.

The transmission times of this beacon are on the hour, every hour.

The transmitted message is the following:

* * *

> 
> DYJEPQY UWLUDCQCKJ XUEOKJ
> DJPQY P6 UNL002
> NEHHY LKCJQ 1E
> OKJSHRW
> LNR EUPOP KCG E64 0
> IKDUPQEJDXY
> (repeated two times)

Note: There are two separate UCB’s approximately 21km’s apart, while they both transmit the same message, the second UCB’s transmission times are at 30 minutes past the hour, every hour.

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of EXODUS yields the message:

> 
> DYNASTY EXPEDITION BEACON
> DNSTY S6 ERP002
> RALLY POINT 1A
> CONFLUX
> PRU AESCS OIK A64 0
> MODESTANDBY

An abandoned settlement can be found within the same system on body 1 a, at 36.1161, -119.5341 (in Live/4.0) or at 64.2251, 74.4099 (in Legacy/3.8).

Around the settlement there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

We’re aiming for a zone known as the Conflux. It’s sure a long way out. Can’t help wondering why we’re doing this.”

Looks like beacons from what I can see, but some guy in uniform came and switched off the scanner. Best not ask too many questions. Might not be wise to be logging this to be honest…”

Managed a quick scan of the site when no one was looking. Definitely beacons. Why would anyone want a beacon right out here in the void is beyond me. Not my problem though!”
