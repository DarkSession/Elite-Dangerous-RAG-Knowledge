## Hercules-class Hauler

Published: 14 Oct 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/hercules-class-bulk-cargo-ship/)

Content: The Hercules-class Hauler is a class of Bulk Cargo Ship.

The class consists of a forward command module, with the central superstructure completely surrounded by six cargo pods, followed by four engine modules.

Two of adjacent cargo pods have Cargo Bays on the side, and two into direction of travel.

It’s total Cargo auf around 650t is Industrial Materials, Machinery, Metals, Minerals and Technology.

Each Cargo Bay is shielded by an Automated Defence Turret. Two more Turrets are found at the Rear defending the “entry” between the Cargo Pods.

The Ship Log Uplink is generally mounted on the central superstructure itself, behind the command module, which will require commanders to fly inside the gap between cargo pods.

A Hercules-class Hauler with call-sign HIP 112970 can be found for reference at the following waypoints: HIP 112970, Khun, Shona, ROSS 667, Shona, Jarildekald.

- Number of Turrets: 6
- Cargo Bays: 4
- Total Cargo: ~650t
- Default Cargo: *Industrial Materials* (Insulating Membrane, Neofabric Insulation, Semiconductors), *Machinery* (Building Fabricators, Energy Grid Assembly, Geological Equipment, Mineral Extractors, Power Generators), *Metals* (Aluminium, Cobalt, Gallium, Gold, Palladium, Indium, Lithium, Osmium, Samarium, Platinum, Silver, Tantalum, Thallium, Titanium, Uranium), *Minerals* (Bauxite, Indite, Pyrophyllite, Uraninite), Technology (Computer Components, Micro Controllers, Robotics)
Rare Commodity Sub-Types: Chemicals, Consumer Items, Machinery, Metals.
