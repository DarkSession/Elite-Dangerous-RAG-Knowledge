An audible mayday call can be heard at the site:

> 
> Mayday, Mayday, we’ve survived a crash and need help. We’re stranded and our supplies are running low. I’m including my coordinates with this transmission.

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground, and adjacent to the ship there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

## Logs

The ship is a derelict Anaconda, and around it there are two Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

* * *

> 
> **NOTHING LEFT BUT HOPE 1/5**
> I can’t believe we survived the crash just to waste away out here. At least The SRV is operational. 
> 
> We’ve set the transponder so someone should find the wreck, but we can’t wait. We’re going to try something.
> 
> With a little luck we’ ll find a settlement or relay station.

* * *

> 
> **NOTHING LEFT BUT HOPE 2/5**
> It feels good to be moving again.
> 
> Not the most comfortable ride we’ve ever had, but Oldham and Clark have managed to modify the SRV cargo compartment in to a cabin using parts from the ship.
> 
> It kind of reminds me of camping trips with my grandfather.
> 
> We also managed to boost the comms output, so with a little luck a passing ship might pick up our mayday. We could use a little luck after all that’s happened.
