Content: Eagle Eye is a series of installations were installed in the Pleiades to monitor Thargoid Activity.

From [Galnet on 10 MAR 3304](https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/5aa12e112e30637590761b2c):

> 
> Aegis has launched an operation to monitor Thargoid activity in the Pleiades Nebula.
> 
> Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison at Aegis, made this statement:
> 
> “Our new Eagle Eye initiative will closely monitor systems where Thargoid surface sites are known to exist.”
> 
> “We have established orbital surveillance installations at six locations in the Pleiades, which will measure energy-level fluctuations and track ship movements. Each installation is attended by a comms beacon that will collect the data before transmitting it to us for analysis.”
> 
> Aegis has confirmed that Eagle Eye installations have been placed in the following systems:
> HIP 17225
> HIP 17692
> HIP 17892
> HR 1185
> Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55
> Pleiades Sector KC-V c2-4
> 
> Professor Alba Tesreau commented:
> “My hope is that this initiative will greatly increase our knowledge of the Thargoids. Observing their ‘natural’ activities, outside of combat zones, should further our understanding of their behaviour.”

The locations are:

| Eagle Eye One | HIP 17692 | A 3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Eagle Eye Two | HR 1185 | A 5 |
| Eagle Eye Three | HIP 17892 | 1 a |
| Eagle Eye Four | HIP 17225 | A 5 |
| Eagle Eye Five | Pleiades Sector KC-V c2-4 | 4 |
| Eagle Eye Six | Delphi (Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55) | 2 |

*Note: Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 was renamed to Delphi in 3304*

The messages from the Unregistered Comms Beacons appear to change on a weekly basis. The Eagle Eye installations give out messages that contain planet locations with Thargoid Structures in nearby systems. These structures contain Thargoid Links that in turn point to various locations which can be:

- Previously Attacked starports
- Unattacked starports
- Thargoid Structures
- Thargoid Barnacles
- Crashed Thargoid ships
- INRA bases and INRA related locations
- Settlements attacked by Thargoids

When targets are starports that have not previously been attacked there is a one week interval where Non Human Signal Sources appear in that system (and surrounding systems). The starport can be saved if CMDRs kill enough Thargoids, but if the (hidden) kill count is not reached then the starport will be attacked and damaged the following week. 

It has been confirmed that success is based upon kill numbers, and only kills in the target system will be counted. This means that kills derived from missions on Aegis ships (which typically give out missions in nearby systems) do not count.

Aegis megaships Vanguard and Acropolis follow the attacks, and often stop in nearby systems each week. They are given a new flight plan before the Eagle Eye messages change, which seems to indicate that Aegis knows internally whether the attack has succeeded before this is reflected via Eagle Eye.

### Decoding the messages

#### Eagle Eye Installations

Each of the installations have an Unregistered Communications Beacon (UCB). These transmit once per hour, on the hour.

 However, they previously has set times for each beacon. (Eagle Eye One transmited on the hour, Eagle Eye Two transmited at ten past, Eagle Eye Three transmited at twenty pastm etc). These transmissions would normally change early Thursday. 

The transmissions use the key INVADERS (early weeks used THARGOIDS) and phonetic letters ([decoder](https://kayahr.github.io/canonn-decryptor/#/?data=N4IgdghgtgpiBcIAMBmAdEgHGgTEgjJgAQC0RAkgEokDqRAIvkQKzMgA0IAlmAA4CuAFwDOCANqgA9kIEjxoAMaSwANxgAnQRoShBAT15xEAaxh6A7pPUATEtZhL76jiEm9BXZaPihTFq9YIIOQAcgBqAIL0AKKUAMogAL7JALqcPLJBSSmJQA%3D%3D)). Since December 3304 the messages contain the names of target systems, often slightly garbled. For instance Maia becomes Maiaiaiaiaia, but further decoding is not required.

### Previous Weeks

These are now on a [weekly reports page](https://canonn.science/codex/eagle-eye-history/), as there is now significant historical data. Locations were only collected until December 3304.
