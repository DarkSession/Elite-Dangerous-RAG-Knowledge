Eagle Eye Report and Summary of the previous week:

For a third time both target systems were successfully defended with Lalande 4141 and Lwalama systems both having the Thargoid threat repelled. Congratulations to all who took to their ships in support - the inhabitants of those systems can breath a sigh of relief. 

Intelligence obtained from Eagle Eye this week shows the targets are HR 1257 and Lusonda, and NHSS have been detected by CMDRs at the scene. 

Aegis Megaships were dispatched to Seliacha and Ancanec, and according to Eagle Eye are being targeted for direct attack by Thargoids next week. Wrecked megaships were found in several systems nearby. 

The other targets given to us by EE were decoded and have indicated a barnacle forest location, and in HIP 15329 the INRA base Stuart Retreat.

Are Aegis heading for a reckoning with the Thargoids next week?
