## The Drive Yards

Content: Dan Gurney Drive Yards is a capital ship dock facility adjacent to the Bella Port station in the Irusan system.

It consists of a large structure and two capital ship bays.

Both contain Farragut-class Battlecruisers undergoing repairs, with both show signs of battle damage. Neither ship is broadcasting a transponder signal, or carries any identifying hull markings, so they cannot be individually identified.

The facility was constructed as a result of an [appeal to the community on 29 SEP 3303](https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/59cd13ab4ea9f623d036a879) by the Candy Crew Guild.
