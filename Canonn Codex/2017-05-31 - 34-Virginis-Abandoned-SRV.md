## Log

Since the SRV is so small, it’s very easy to miss.

There are Engineer Materials on the ground behind the SRV.

Within the SRV is an SRV Comms Log Uplink, scanning it gives background on what happened here:

> 
> **ASK FOR DIRECTIONS**
> You said it was going to be pretty out here! How is this dustball a suitable location for our honeymoon?
> 
> Ok, I think we might be lost and no I can’t ask for directions… Because there’s no one out here!
> 
> “We’ll go down to the surface,” you said. “It’ll be an adventure,” you said. Now we’re lost on this rock.
> 
> I hope you fired the intern you used to arrange this. I don’t care who his daddy is.
> 
> My mother was right about you.
> 
> What do you mean get out? Where am I going to go, we’re in the middle of nowhere.
