## Log

While the cache appears to have a number of interesting items, none of them are scoopable by your SRV or ship.

In front of the cache there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

Within the cache, underneath the canopy, there are three Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, however a message giving background to the cache is only given by one:

> 
> **GETTING YOUR HANDS DIRTY**
> If I hadn’t shot him we would have been knee deep in police by now. Do you want us to get caught? Is that it?
> 
> If you didn’t want to get your hands dirty, you shouldn’t have signed up to this. If we hadn’t vented the ship, the crew would have called the police and we’d be so much space dust.
> 
> Stash the loot and make sure any transponders are disabled. We didn’t steal these things just for someone to track them down. We’ll come back in a few days to collect it once the heat is off us.
