## Capsule Mollusc

Published: 09 Sep 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/capsule-mollusc/)

Content: There are several varieties of Capsule Molluscs to be found around the galaxy – notably in the Odin’s Hold sector. They appear inside Notable Stellar Phenomena. Look for the largest concentration of signals inside the phenomena and you should find them (if they are present). 

In-game codex information shows that the different variants appear near different planet types, and have different requirements for Star Types – more can be found in the game codex.

Space lifeforms often have discoverable traits – scan them with the Composition Scanner when they are doing something to reveal the traits. For Capsule Molluscs these are the traits:

- Approaches nearby objects
- Approaches and damages nearby objects

If you have Research Limpets you can sample the Capsule Molluscs and get Mollusc Fluid, Brain Tissue and Soft Tissue.
