Content: Recon 6 Crash Site is a crashed Diamondback Explorer in the HIP 17746 system on body 3 c, at 28.7029, 16.5512 (in Live/4.0) or at 23.1706, 14.8575 (in Legacy/3.8).

The existence of this crash site was hinted by the logs at [Relay Station PSJ-17](https://canonn.science/codex/relay-station-psj-17), and the location of this site can be found by following the two nearby listening posts located in:
HR 1185 / Pleiades Sector HR-W d1-57
