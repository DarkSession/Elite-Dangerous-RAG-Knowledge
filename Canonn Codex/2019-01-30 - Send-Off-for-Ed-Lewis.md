## Send Off for Ed Lewis

Published: 30 Jan 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/news/send-off-for-ed-lewis/)

Content: Join us this **Thursday evening (31st January 3305)** in **Alpha Centauri** at **Hutton Orbital** with **The Hutton Truckers** for an impromptu send off for the brilliant **Ed Lewis**, a long-term **friend** of Canonn Research and a hugely **important** member of the Galactic **community**. Bring rares, chaff, and buy mugs and gin.

The **Gnosis** is in Varati prepping for **DIRECT** **transfer** to the outpost Thursday morning, so be securely docked on board if you wish to avoid the long supercruise before 06:00UTC on Thursday.

Let’s make this a great **send-off for Ed**, from his many friends in the community.

Also take a look at a visual **Fond Look Back** at previous Educating Ed’s with a message about community from Ed himself, assembled by Cmdr Starbeaver and helpers.
