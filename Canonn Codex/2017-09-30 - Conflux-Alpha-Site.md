Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Pru Aescs TY-J a64-1 system, orbiting body 1.

The transmission times of this beacon are on the hour, every hour.

The transmitted message is the following:

* * *

> 
> DYJEPQY UWLUDCQCKJ XUEOKJ
> DJPQY P6 UNL002
> NEHHY LKCJQ 3
> OKJSHRW
> LNR EUPOP QYF E64 1
> IKDUPQEJDXY
> (repeated two times)

Note: There are two separate UCB’s approximately 20km’s apart, however, both UCB’s transmit the same message at the same transmission times.

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of EXODUS yields the message:

> 
> DYNASTY EXPEDITION BEACON
> DNSTY S6 ERP002
> RALLY POINT 3
> CONFLUX
> PRU AESCS TYJ A64 1
> MODESTANDBY

An abandoned settlement can be found within the same system on body 3, at 57.0706, 94.2092 (in Live/4.0) or at -66.4698, -56.1327 (in Legacy/3.8).

Around the settlement there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:
