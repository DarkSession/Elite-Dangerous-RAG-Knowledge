## HIP 14909 Distress Call &#038; Unknown Structure

Published: 19 Jul 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/hip-14909-distress-call/)

Content: A “Distress Call” signal source may be found in the HIP 14909 system, orbiting body 1.
Note: As of June 3306 the Distress Call no longer exists – there is now a Nav Panel marker called “Anomalous Signal” that only contains a Black Box.

The location of this Distress Call is revealed by the three nearby listening posts:
Merope / Pleiades Sector AB-W b2-4 / HIP 19072

The source of the Distress Call is the wreckage of a Federal Navy Corvette, destroyed by weapons consistent with other Thargoid attacks, leaving green hull scarring and some kind of green gas throughout the area.

An active [Thargoid Structure](https://canonn.science/codex/the-unknown-structure/) can also be found in this system body 2 a, at **-9.7278**, **39.0772** (in Live/4.0) or at -26.4558, -27.4746 (in Legacy/3.8). This was the first active site discovered.
