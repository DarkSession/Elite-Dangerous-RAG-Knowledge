## Parasol Mollusc

Published: 09 Sep 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/parasol-mollusc/)

Content: There are several varieties of Parasol Molluscs to be found around the galaxy – notably in the Izanami sector. They appear inside Notable Stellar Phenomena. Look for the largest concentration of signals inside the phenomena and you should find them (if they are present). 

In-game codex information shows that the different variants appear near different planet types, and have different requirements for Star Types – more can be found in the game codex.

Space lifeforms often have discoverable traits – scan them with the Composition Scanner when they are doing something to reveal the traits. For Parasol Molluscs these are the traits:

- Turns towards nearest star
- Retreats if attacked

If you have Research Limpets you can sample the Parasol Molluscs and get Mollusc Spores and Mollusc Membrane.
