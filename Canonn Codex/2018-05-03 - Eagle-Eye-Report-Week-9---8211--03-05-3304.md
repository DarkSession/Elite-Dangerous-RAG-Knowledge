Eagle Eye Report and Summary of the previous week:
The defense of Deneb Algedi seems to have been successful however we paid the price with the attack of SPOCS 253.

4 populated systems this week have been decoded, Argestes, Xihe, Flech & 63 G. Capricorni. We believe the actual targets are Argestes & 63 G. Capricorni as these systems are showing non human signals throughout. 
Again the other 2 decoded systems Hermitage & LP 389-95 both contain abandoned I.N.R.A. facilities. We have detailed information in the Canonn codex regarding the I.N.R.A. installations. Are the Thargoids looking for something? More intelligence is required. Again patrols will continue throughout all the decoded systems.
