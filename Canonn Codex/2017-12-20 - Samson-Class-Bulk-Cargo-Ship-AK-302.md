Published: 20 Dec 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/samson-class-bulk-cargo-ship-ak-302/)

Content: A Samson Class Bulk Cargo Ship, designation AK-302, has been attacked by pirates and can be found in the California Sector BV-Y c7 system, orbiting body 1.

A number of Engineer Materials / Cargo are scattered nearby. The location can spawn one of three sets of ships:

- Pirates which will scan you for cargo, or
- Terrorists and Police who will fight each other, or
- a rescue party for the ship

There is a Ship Uplink, the message is:

> 
> **COMMUNICATIONS LOG**
> …Open Communication Activated…
> 
> 
> 
> To pirate vessels, cease fire and we can negotiate terms of surrendering our cargo.
> 
> 
> 
> We don’t come for your cargo commander, we come for your crew.

This attack seems to be part of a wave of attacked Megaships in the California Sector, probably related to a [Community Goal](https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/5a3ceddbf2f337081c104768) from 29 DEC 3303.
