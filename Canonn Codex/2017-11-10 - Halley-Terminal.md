Note: The message previously had an error where it referred to the Karis system, which contains a different unnamed installation that is related to the Pirate Lord Luca, and not the Grey Comets bounty hunters.

System security response is unavailable at the installation, use caution.

Three Ship Log Uplink points can be located on the structure. Deploy your ship’s hardpoints and use the onboard Data Link Scanner within 200m of the post to scan them and retrieve the logs:

The Silver Comet comes from a short story in “Tales From The Frontier”: “The Comet’s Trail”, by Darren Grey, and was the subject of an [early Galnet article on 27 JAN 3301](https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/27-JAN-3301).
