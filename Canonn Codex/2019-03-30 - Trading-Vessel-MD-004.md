> Tip 38:
> 
> This might be your first crash, it might be, say, your 46th, not to be too specific about it, but learn from a pro. You can’t use domestic appliances to repair your thruster manifolds.
> 
> It turns out all that does is make a lot of smoke and a very loud bang. Not to mention the hull breach in the engine compartment.

> Who knew, right?

> 
> A rookie mistake that a lot of first time crashers fall into is mixing up the water supply with the urine disposal system. Colour code that bad boy.
