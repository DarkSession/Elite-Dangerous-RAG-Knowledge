## HIP 79884 Anomalous Signal

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/hip-79884-anomalous-signal/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the HIP 79884 system, orbiting body 4. 

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be on the hour, every 4 hours, with transmissions reported at: 00:00 / 04:00 / 08:00 / 12:00 / 16:00 / 20:00.

 The transmitted message is the following:

> 
> 14 15 23 9 3 18 25
> (repeated four times)

Decodes by letter positions to:

> 
> NOWICRY

This message is the decryption key for an encoded Galnet article in the local Herald:

> 
> November Delta Sierra 7 9 8 8 4 Echo Hotel Foxtrot
> Mike Bravo Juliett Foxtrot Bravo Sierra Alpha Bravo
> Foxtrot Delta Uniform Papa Quebec Bravo Echo Hotel
> Victor Delta Bravo Alpha 1

The message consists of a series of words that can be interpreted as the NATO phonetic alphabet, yielding the message:

> 
> NDS79884EHFMBJFBSABFDUPQBEHVDBA1

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of NOWICRY taken from the beacon yielded the message:

> 
> HIP79884CARGODROPNORISKLOCATION1

This leads to a “Anomalous Signal Detected” signal source in the HIP 79884 system, orbiting body 1. This appears to be a permanent equivalent to the Distress Call (Threat 0) signal source sometimes seen in other systems.
