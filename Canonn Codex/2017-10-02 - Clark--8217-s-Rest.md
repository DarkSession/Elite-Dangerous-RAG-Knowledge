> Clark is dead.

> Must have had some internal injuries from the crash that he didn’t tell us about.
> 
> Oldham and I buried him on a peak nearby with a nice view, I think he would have appreciated that. He always liked to capture images of the planets we explored.
> 
> Our supplies are running low, but I still have hope that our distress calls will be picked up. 
> 
> The SRV was never meant to support more than one person. We’ve jury rigged what we can to make the oxygen filters last longer, but I think we have to face facts.
> 
> This has to work, it has to.
