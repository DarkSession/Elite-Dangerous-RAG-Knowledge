## Logs

A series of four Ship Log Uplink points can be located along the hull. Deploy your ship’s hardpoints and use the onboard Data Link Scanner within 200m of each post to scan them and retrieve the logs. In addition to the text, each log is accompanied by an audio recording:

> This is Officer Gant. I know I haven’t made many of these logs – haven’t needed to – but recent events mean I have to open a record. The Venusian has been travelling for months now without incident, other than the usual canteen disputes and a couple of bar fights. Recently though, sensors have picked up a number of heat signals, though no sign of any actual ships… that is, until today.

> Two small ships of unknown designation were briefly caught on sensors until they initiated supercruise and disappeared. We don’t know where they’ve come from or where they’ve gone, and attempts to hail them were met with silence. The XO, Deacon, thinks it’s nothing to worry about but I’ve got to admit, I’m nervous. Anyway, we’re keeping an eye out and the comms team are on high alert. Maybe it’s nothing.

> They came out of a gas nebula, a pirate fleet, all manner of ships and some of them highly modified. Every single one was red though. Blood red. Our auto defences were useless and the raiders breached the hull with mining lasers. By the time they’d got inside I’d managed to rustle up a decent defence force, but we couldn’t stop them spreading through the decks. The fighting was fierce at first and we put up a good resistance, but when the best of our crew were cut down there was nothing the rest of us could do.

> All l could do was initiate a rearguard action while we tried to save as many people as we could. Deacon managed to rally some troops and we pushed them back long enough to retreat to aft. Not sure how long we’re gonna last.
> Deacon keeps talking about a parlay, but these are pirates on a slave hunt. They won’t stop until we’re all dead or in chains. And frankly I’d take death over slavery any day.

> Deacon’s disappeared. Either fled or captured I don’t know which. I can only hope he managed to escape somehow and has gone to get help from somewhere. Anywhere.

> I know, I’m kidding myself. We’re done for, and it’s just a matter of time before they breach our defences. No matter – I’ll fight till the last. They won’t take me alive.
