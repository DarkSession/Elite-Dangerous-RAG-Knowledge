## Aster Trees and Aster Pods

Published: 09 Sep 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/aster-trees-and-aster-pods/)

Content: There are several varieties of Aster Trees and their associated pods to be found around the galaxy – notably in the Formorian Frontier sector. They appear inside Notable Stellar Phenomena. Look for the largest concentration of signals inside the phenomena and you should find them.

In-game codex information shows that the different variants appear near different planet types, and have different requirements for Star Types – more can be found in the game codex.

Space lifeforms often have discoverable traits – scan them with the Composition Scanner when they are doing something to reveal the traits. For Aster Pods these are the traits:

- Moves without apparent purpose
- Releases spores if approached
