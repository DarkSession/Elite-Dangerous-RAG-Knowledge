## Lowell-class Researcher

Published: 14 Oct 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/lowell-class-science-vessel/)

Content: The Lowell-class Researcher is a class of Science Vessel.

The class consists of a science command module on the front, followed by a long superstructure of various modules, and a drive module on the rear.

Towards direction of travel, one Cargo Bay can be found. In direction of rear there is a Hackable Data Transmitter, and a second Cargo Bay.

Its default Cargo of around 450 tons is Chemicals, Minerals and Technology.

There are two Ship Log Uplinks. One is generally mounted on the nose of the ship, the other in its middle.

- Hackable Data Transmitters: 1
- Cargo Bays: 2
- Total Cargo: ~450t
- Default Cargo: *Chemicals* (Hydrogen Fuel, Hydrogen Peroxide, Liquid Oxygen, Mineral Oil, Water), *Minerals* (Bertrandite, Coltan, Gallite, Rutile), *Technology* (Computer Components, Micro Controllers, Robotics)
- Rare Commodity Sub-Types: Consumer Items, Medicines
