Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Plaa Aec XZ-Z b41-0 system, orbiting body 1.

The transmission times of this beacon are on the hour, every hour.

The transmitted message is the following:

* * *

> 
> DYJEPQY UWLUDCQCKJ XUEOKJ
> DJPQY P6 UNL001
> NEHHY LKCJQ 2
> BEVGCJP AEL
> LHEE EUO WZZ X41 0
> IKDUPQEJDXY
> (repeated two times)

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of EXODUS yields the message:

> 
> DYNASTY EXPEDITION BEACON
> DNSTY S6 ERP001
> RALLY POINT 2
> HAWKINS GAP
> PLAA AEC XZZ B41 0
> MODESTANDBY

An abandoned settlement can be found within the same system on body 2, at -21.1968, -149.6210 (in Live/4.0) or at 36.3801, -12.7082 (in Legacy/3.8).

Within the settlement there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

Around the settlement there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:
