## Logs

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground, and next to the entrance of the settlement there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

Around the settlement there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

> **BAD MEDICINE 1/4**
> Personal Log:
> 
> We weren’t looking for this. But no we’ve found it I don’t think I can hide it.
> 
> We came out into the far reaches of space looking for new chemicals and materials for medical research. We hoped to find new cures, but this…this is not a cure.

> 
> **BAD MEDICINE 2/4**
> Personal Log:
> 
> This compound is lethal in every sense of the word.
> 
> Our usual containment protocols were next to useless and 3 of the team members are now dead because of our inadequacies.
> 
> I’ve sealed the lab to stop anyone else coming into contact with it.

> 
> Things got a little heated I’ll admit, but Deresta has to see reason.
> 
> We can’t give this compound to anyone. We have to destroy our samples and notes.

>  He wanted to hand it off to the military or worse open it up to private corporations.
> 
> There is no telling what kind of damage that would cause.
> 
> l can’t allow it, I’m going to destroy all evidence. Bury our discovery.

> **BAD MEDICINE 4/4**
> Personal Log:
> 
> I didn’t want any bloodshed.
> 
> I didn’t mean to…but Deresta’s dead.
> 
> I caught him trying to smuggle the samples out of the lab. I thought he had been acting oddly, but I didn’t think he would try something like this.
> 
> I don’t know, it all happened so fast. One minute we were struggling and the next he was on the ground.
> 
> I’ve destroyed the evidence and confessed to the deaths here. They’re shutting this place down, so hopefully no one will follow our work.
