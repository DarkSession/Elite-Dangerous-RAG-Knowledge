Eagle Eye Report and Summary of the previous week:

Now for an astounding sixth time in a row both target systems were successfully defended - with Kung Mu and Nauni systems both having the Thargoid threat repelled. Against all odds, the residents of both systems can breath a collective sigh of relief (even though a number of refugees fled Nauni due to continuing poor local conditions). Thank you to all who assisted in these efforts.

Intelligence obtained from Eagle Eye this week shows the targets are Assinda (Hennepin Prospect) and Kambila (Gurney Oasis).

Only one of the Aegis Megaships moved - the Acropolis jumped to Daruwutja but the Vanguard stayed in Socho, and the crashed Scout on HIP 17403 A 4 A along with Taylor Keep INRA base in 12 Trianguli are targeted.  The Thargoids finally also look to have found the INRA Mayes Chemical Plant this week – they now know about all the INRA settlements that we do. Eagle Eye also pointed to the permit locked Col 70 (which is one of the reference systems used in the Thargoid location calculations).

Perhaps the Thargoids spared Nauni from a second attack - could it be that they have displayed empathy towards the plight of the people there and spared them a second attack? Or was it simply due to the significant actions of the brave AXI, Lab69 XIA and independent commanders that they were spared further suffering? Without some mechanism to in some way communicate with the aliens it is impossible to know - perhaps there is more information to be derived from the Glyphs displayed on their Interceptors. I can't help but shake the feeling there may be something we have missed, and I am not alone in this line of thought.

With Eagle Eye drawing attention to INRA assets as well as Col 70 Sector FY-N c21-3 - which has long been a key but inaccessible part of the Thargoid enigma - I fear we are soon to find out how little we really know.
