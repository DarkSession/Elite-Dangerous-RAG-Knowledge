## Logs

The settlement is patrolled by three skimmers, and an audible alert indicates that the settlement is under attack.

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground, and next to the entrance of the settlement there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

Around the settlement there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

> Get off your arse, the security system is on the fritz again.

> I’m getting multiple malfunctions on my screen. Units 3 and 7 are reporting an order to go into reset mode and the others are refusing to obey the order to return to the hangar.
> 
> If we can’t get this to work, they’re going to shut us down.

> 
> Sir, I believe we’ve isolated the issue in the skimmer code. It looks like some anomalous code has been added to the skimmers that is not part of the programme. it’s very complex and seems to be designed to override the skimmers’ ability to follow operator orders and run independently.
> 
> Any Idea how it got in there?
> 
> No idea. But I can tell you it was before we shipped out. Whoever did this really knew what they were doing. I think I can remove the code and have the skimmers up and running.
> 
> Just see what you can do. And be careful what you mess with in there. These things are sensitive pieces of equipment.

> **CAREFUL WHAT YOU MESS WITH 4/4**
> Emergency. I repeat, emergency.
> 
> Security systems are off line. The skimmers have gone haywire. Some kind of backup subroutine triggered by adjustments to their control code. They’re operating independently. All attempts to bring them under operator control have failed. They are killing everyone on sight.
> 
> Please send help… We can’t hold out much longer.
