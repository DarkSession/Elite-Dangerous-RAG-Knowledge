## Fuel Rats Checkpoint

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/fuel-rats-checkpoint/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Kitani system, at body A, B Belt – Cluster 1. 

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be on the hour, every 3 hours, with transmissions reported at: 00:00 / 03:00 / 06:00 / 09:00 / 12:00 / 15:00 / 18:00 / 21:00. 

The transmitted message is the following:

> 
> 4 1 14 7 5 18 15 21 19
> (repeated four times)

Decodes by letter positions to:

> 
> DANGEROUS

This message is the decryption key for an encoded Galnet article in the local Herald:

The message consists of a series of words that can be interpreted as the NATO phonetic alphabet, yielding the message:

> 
> PNUBCN-LHEQFBUI-SQBCEUJ1-UMFEBU2

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of DANGEROUS taken from the beacon yielded the message:

> 
> KITANI-FUELRATS-PLANETB1-THREAT2

This leads to a “Checkpoint” signal source in the Kitani system, orbiting body B 1. The signal source contains the wreckage of a ship and some canisters of Hydrogen Fuel.

Upon entering the signal source, a few Fuel Rat NPCs will also drop out of super cruise, usually 2-3 Fuel Rats and 1 “Momma Rat” and investigate the wreckage – reporting that it is a total loss, before scooping up the canisters.

Some of the comments concerning the wreckage, include:

> 
> Control, this is Rescue One. It’s a complete disaster out here, debris all over the place. Whatever hit this transport made one hell of a mess.

> 
> Control, this is Rescue Team 33. Getting some strange readings from the debris. I think this thing blew up from the inside out.

> 
> Rescue One to Control, it’s not looking good, debris all over the system. Some of the escape pods are missing, lets just hope someone managed to survive this thing.

> 
> Dispatch, this is Rescue Team 96. It‘s a total loss I’m afraid… no survivors. 96 out.
