Content: A Naphtha Class Tanker IPD-038 can be found around Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 2 b. It shows signs of having being attacked by Thargoids. There are materials / cargo / escape pods in the area, and there will usually be either as medical rescue fleet or a Thargoid in the area.

There is a Ship Log Uplink on one of the damaged rings:

> This is the Captain. Please remain calm, we’ve all heard the stories and know this might be a risk. I’m sure once it has scanned the ship it will be on it’s way.
