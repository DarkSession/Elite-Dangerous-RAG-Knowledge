*Extremophiles that are found primarily on planets with atmospheres dominated by sulphur dioxide. Using a combination of inorganic and hydrocarbon materials, they build a shielding bubble. This allows them to create an isolated biome with regulated temperature and chemical composition. Growth is a difﬁcult and complex process that requires careful melting, regrowing and freezing of the external shell so that the internal organism can develop. This is a gradual process meaning that larger Recepta are of significant age. Reproduction is also similarly complex and revolves around a budding process, which creates a smaller version of the adult. Once detached, it can roll under the action of gravity and air currents before coming to rest, where it will deploy a holdfast marking its final position.*

*Recepta favour flattish, slightly undulating or gently sloping terrain.*

Recepta is one of the Genera with a dual variant determinant. The cross-Species rule for Stellar Class determinant holds true, i.e. Stellar Class X = Variant Colour Y across all Stellar Class determinant Species within the Genus.

For Stellar Class determinant Species in such Genera it is also possible to state generalised planetary body type and atmosphere preferences as these show a relatively limited set of values. The same is not true for the Material determinant Species. These show considerably more differentiation, to the extent that no generalisation will be made but each Material determinant Species treated individually.

*A Recepta Species where the body of the organism is suspended above ground inside a sphere-shaped translucent membrane. This is filled with chemical-rich ﬂuid that both protects the organism and provides the chemical soup needed for metabolism. Chemical exchange is controlled actively through the membrane and passively through the extensive root structure.*

*A Recepta Species that produces a thick lattice of trunks in a deltahedron shape. This grows around and above the globular central organism, and helps to capture, retain and focus geothermal heat for thermosynthesis.*
