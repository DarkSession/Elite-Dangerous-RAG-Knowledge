## Orbital Installations

Published: 26 Sep 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/orbital-installations/)

Content: Orbital Installations appear on your Navigation Panel when your ship is within 1,000 Ls of them. Explorers are suggested to regularly check their Navigation Panel when traversing a system to perform surface scans, and report any strange signal sources, including Installations.

In addition to the Installation itself, many contain Satellites which can be scanned for Engineer Data; and some contain Navigation Beacons and the same assortment of ships that can be found at the system’s primary beacon, thus making a more interesting bounty hunting ground, for example.

Installations are not Stations or Outposts, they offer no docking facilities.
