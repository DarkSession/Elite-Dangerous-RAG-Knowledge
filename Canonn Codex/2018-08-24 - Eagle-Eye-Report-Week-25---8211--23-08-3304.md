 Subject: Eagle Eye Report Week 25 - 24/08/3304

Attacks on Pemepatung and LP 102-320 have been staved off this week thanks to the valiant efforts of AXI, The Hive, and countless independent pilots across human populated space.

The Eagle Eye listening posts have gone into a state of "re-calibration" according to AEGIS and with any luck should be back online next week. If they fail to come back online, Lab 69 will continue to survey and patrol the human populated bubble and inform pilots as to the possible whereabouts of the Thargoid fleets.

With this in mind, one target has been found of Thargoid interest this week using the patrol method. LHS 283 has all types of Thargoid vessel. This is the only target that has been identified.

An instructional package has been prepared for Aden Tanner in the proper handling of Thargoid related technologies given his knowledge of them - to be quite frank - is laughable.
