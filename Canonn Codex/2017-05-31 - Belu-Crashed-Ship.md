Content: This is a crashed Anaconda on Belu B 1 at 7.1537, -40.1309. The location of this crash site is provided by scanning the Settlement Comms Log Uplinks at the [Unlisted Wreckage Site](https://canonn.science/codex/unlisted-wreckage-site/) on Col 285 Sector EP-C b27-3 A 2.

Note that the co-ordinates given in those logs are incorrectly inverted; also that the body on which the site resides is over 260,000 Ls from the arrival point in the system.

On the ground around the wreck are a number of cargo canisters, mostly Search & Rescue cargo â€“ a selection of the following have been found:

- Escape Pods
- Black Box
- Technical Blueprints
- Tactical Data
- Military Intelligence
- Personal Effects
- Prototype Tech
- Assault Plans
- Wreckage Components

There is a a cargo rack that can be scanned (and shot for low grade raw materials), but that gives no further information. Within the crashed ship itself a Ship Data Core can be scanned for an Intel Package.
