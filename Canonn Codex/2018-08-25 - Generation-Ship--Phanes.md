## Logs

A series of four Ship Log Uplink points can be located along the hull. Deploy your ship’s hardpoints and use the onboard Data Link Scanner within 200m of each post to scan them and retrieve the logs. In addition to the text, each log is accompanied by an audio recording:

> **THE LAST PEOPLE 1/4**
> Warrant Officer Noonan – Personal Log 512/9
> 
> I must admit, sometimes our mission seems futile. It’s still difficult to accept that we’re the last humans in the galaxy. But who am I to argue with Command?
> 
> Details regarding the end of humanity are scarce, and discussion of it is forbidden. The rumour is there was some kind of cataclysm. Sol was the first to fall, followed by every inhabited system in the core. Plague, famine, war – it could have been anything. All I know is we’re the last vestige of humankind. And we must find a new home if our race is to survive.
> 
> Who knows what would have happened without Command. They’ve guided and protected us for hundreds of years. If I prove my worth, maybe one day they’ll ask me to join them. But for now I’m happy to serve in whatever way I can.

> 
> **THE LAST PEOPLE 2/4**
> Warrant Officer Noonan – Personal Log 576/4
> 
> Something really weird happened today. I was accompanying Admiral Kerr on a tour of the ship. Actually, it was more a case of pushing his wheelchair while he mumbled about the good old days. Everyone knows the Admiral should have been put out to pasture years ago – he’s certainly not dealing with a full deck. Anyway, he said the strangest thing.
> 
> As we were passing communications he suggested we send a progress report to Sol. I tried to explain that Sol was gone, but he was insistent. Then he seemed to clam up, as if he’d said something he shouldn’t have. He was silent for the rest of the tour.
> 
> I’m not sure whether or not to mention it to Command. Talk of Sol is forbidden you know, but I don’t want the old man to get in trouble. At his age who wouldn’t be confused?

> 
> **THE LAST PEOPLE 3/4**
> Warrant Officer Noonan – Personal Log 612/8
> 
> The incident with Admiral Kerr really played on my mind, so I decided to do some digging. I shouldn’t have done it, I know, but I just couldn’t stop thinking about what he said. I used his Command clearance to access the ship’s archives. I almost wish I hadn’t now.
> 
> We’re not the last bastion of humanity. That was a lie. A deception designed to dupe every man, woman and child aboard the ship.
> 
> Our mission should have ended generations ago, but when the ship reached its destination the planet was found to be uninhabitable. Most people wanted to turn back, but Command wanted to continue and find a new colonisable planet. There was an uprising, which was violently brought to an end. Afterwards, they put out reports that we were the last members of the human race in an effort to keep us under control. It was all a lie.
> 
> I’m not sure what to do with this information. Would anyone even believe me if I told them?

> 
> **THE LAST PEOPLE 4/4**
> Warrant Officer Noonan – Personal Log 625/7
> 
> I didn’t mean for things to get out of hand, but the people had a right to know the truth. I only told a few people I thought could be trusted – but it spread like wildfire. Within hours, Command was faced with an angry mob threatening mutiny and they responded with overwhelming force.
> 
> Over the last few days the ship has been engulfed in conflict. Two factions have emerged – one that wants to return to the core, and one that wants to continue with the mission.
> 
> People are dying and it’s all my fault. Why did I tell them? All I can do now is try to stop the killing, before every last person on this ship is wiped out.
