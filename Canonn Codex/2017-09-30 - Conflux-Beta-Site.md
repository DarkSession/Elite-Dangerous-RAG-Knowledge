## Conflux Beta Site

Published: 30 Sep 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/conflux-beta-site/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Pru Aescs HW-S b31-2 system, orbiting body A.

The transmission times of this beacon are on the hour, every hour.

The transmitted message is the following:

* * *

> 
> DYJEPQY UWLUDCQCKJ XUEOKJ
> DJPQY P6 UNL002
> NEHHY LKCJQ OD1
> OKJSHRW
> LNR EUPOP BVP X31 2
> IKDUPQEJDXY
> (repeated two times)

Note: There are two separate UCB’s approximately 29 km’s apart, while they both transmit the same message, the second UCB’s transmission times are at 15 minutes past the hour, every hour.

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of EXODUS yields the message:

> 
> DYNASTY EXPEDITION BEACON
> DNSTY S6 ERP002
> RALLY POINT CD1
> CONFLUX
> PRU AESCS HWS B31 2
> MODESTANDBY

An abandoned settlement can be found within the same system on body CD 1, at -7.2893, -35.9571 (in Live/4.0 and Legacy/3.8).

Note: a minor piece of the settlement appears to have been discarded during construction, approximately 450m behind the two radio towers.

Around the settlement there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

## Logs

Note: The logs have been sorted via date rather than by log ID, as the logs appear to be incorrectly numbered.
