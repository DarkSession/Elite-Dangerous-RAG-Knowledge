*Robust woody plants with deep rooting structures to gather liquids and hold themselves in place where the ground may be unstable. They are photosynthetic organisms with specialised photoreceptors that work even in low light conditions. As such they are highly successful, and are widespread and diverse in nature and in atmospheric tolerance, although as yet unrecorded on icy worlds. Their small leaf structures protect them against extremely low temperatures and against liquid loss in higher temperatures.*

*Species of the Genus Frutexa are highly adaptive and can colonise most terrain from plains to low mountains.*
