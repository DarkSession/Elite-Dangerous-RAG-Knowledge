Prior to a Titan being destroyed, it’s thermal core would have needed to have been significantly damaged, causing the Titan to enter a meltdown state. 

After 24 hour’s of being in a meltdown state, the Titan entered a critical state, losing structural integrity and was destroyed.

Titan Cocijo was previously located in the Col 285 Sector BA-P c6-18​ system, until it started travelling toward Sol on 28 Nov 3310, finally arriving on 5 Dec 3310.
