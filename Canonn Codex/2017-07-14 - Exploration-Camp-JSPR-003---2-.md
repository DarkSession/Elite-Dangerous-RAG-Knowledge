## Logs

This site has the same name, layout, and backstory as the site [Exploration Camp JSPR-003](https://canonn.science/codex/exploration-camp-jspr-003/)

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground, and within the settlement there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

Around the settlement there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

> **LEAVE A LIGHT ON 1/4**
> Personal Log:
> 
> It’s been an exciting journey so far.
> 
> Commander Norris and the team are saying that these geological features and the data we’re getting back from them could rethink the way we look for alien life or terraforming planets for habitation.
> 
> The whole team has gone to analyse the latest site and take samples. I’m holding the fort. As the habitation engineer it’s my job to make sure everything in camp is working correctly and the habs and equipment are maintained.
> 
>  Not as exciting as ground break geological science, but essential for a project this far out in space.

> 
> This is so messed up. The comms are completely down, I can’t get a signal in or out. Something out there is disrupting the communications.
