No restrictions whatsoever today, including making some money from the war. If involving yourself in the war, please take a balanced approach - play both sides so, should either faction start shoving their CMDRs at it, we're not delaying an end to the war.

The hope is that the war can knock our own influence down a notch, which will be healthy... so long as it doesn't go down too far while one of the warring factions rises.

Basically, go ahead, feel free to make money rather than back Canonn today. Subject to review tomorrow depending on the traffic/numbers.
