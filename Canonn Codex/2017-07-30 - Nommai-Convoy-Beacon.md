## Nommai Convoy Beacon

Published: 30 Jul 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/nommai-convoy-beacon/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Nommai system, orbiting body 4. 

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be on the hour, every 4 hours, with transmissions reported at: 00:00 / 04:00 / 08:00 / 12:00 / 16:00 / 20:00. 

The transmitted message is the following:

> 
> 19 3 1 14 20 8 5 13
> (repeated four times)

Decodes by letter positions to:

> 
> SCANTHEM

This message is the decryption key for an encoded Galnet article in the local Herald:
*(Note: this Herald is no longer available – March 3310)*

> 
> **THE NOMMAI HERALD**
> 25 Oct 3302
> 
> \*\*\*Compromised Carrier Signal\*\*\*
> 
> Delta Quebec Hotel Hotel Charlie Mike – India Quebec
> Juliet Yankee 3 – Bravo Charlie Tango Lima Quebec
> Bravo Quebec Delta Victor Quebec Yankee – Mike
> Hotel Romeo Golf Delta Juliet Mike Delta Lima Juliet
> Charlie Delta Lima Golf Tango

The message consists of a series of words that can be interpreted as the NATO phonetic alphabet, yielding the message:

> 
> DQHHCM-IQJY3-BCTLQBQDVQY-MHRGDJMDLJCDLGT

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of SCANTHEM taken from the beacon yielded the message:

> 
> NOMMAI-BODY3-CARGOCONVOY-IMPENDINGDANGER

This leads to a “Convoy Beacon” signal source in the Nommai system, in orbit of body 3.

Rather than a permanent equivalent of other known Convoy Beacons, this ships in the convoys usually found within this source carry the same designations as those seen at [Communication Hub Zeta 12](https://canonn.science/codex/communication-hub-zeta-12/) and [Relay Station PSJ-17](https://canonn.science/codex/relay-station-psj-17/).

The cargo these ships are carrying includes Meta Alloys and Unknown Artefacts.
