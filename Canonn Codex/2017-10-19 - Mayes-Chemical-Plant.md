## Mayes Chemical Plant

Published: 19 Oct 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/mayes-chemical-plant/)

Content: Mayes Chemical Plant is an abandoned settlement in the HIP 59382 system, on body 1 b, at 11.3971, 177.0653 (in Live/4.0 and Legacy/3.8).

The location of this facility was given in the logs found at [Klatt Enterprises](https://canonn.science/codex/klatt-enterprises/).

It was operated by the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm (INRA), a co-operative between the Federation and Empire that operated during the last war with the Thargoids. This facility appears to have had connections to the project that created the mycoid used against the Thargoids, operating as a production facility.

The facility contains a large central building, a number of agricultural tents, habitation modules, hangar or barracks buildings, three small silo-like structures, and large tanks marked with the symbol for the mycoid weapon; the ground is stained in a manner consistent with leakage of the agent.

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground, and within the facility there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

> I understand that this is lucrative contract, but I really think we need to take a second look at the production schedule. We have neither the facilities nor the workforce to deliver what’s been promised. Furthermore, the facility should be subjected to a complete decontamination before we start. That could take weeks.
> 
> Essentially, we can’t produce the chemicals in the quantity requested within the given timeframe. It just can’t be done.
> 
> I’d also like to renew my request for more information on the purpose of the chemical.

> I understand that you have raised questions regarding the reassignment of your predecessor. It was decided that her experience and expertise could be put to better use in another part of our organisation.

> As discussed, it is of the utmost importance that the chemical be in production within three weeks.

> Our analysis has confirmed that the latest batch was contaminated, and is therefore useless. I’m sure we hardly need remind you how essential it is that this project proceeds without complication. The cause of the contamination must be determined immediately.

> The issue with the previous batch arose because your unrealistic deadlines forced us to take shortcuts. If we were given more time, mistakes of this kind would not occur. With that said, we have rectified the issue and extended working hours so we can replace the tainted batch without deviating from schedule. The next shipment will arrive in HIP 7158 A 2 D within 72 hours.
