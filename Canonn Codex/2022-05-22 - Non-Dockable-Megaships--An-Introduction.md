**1. What classifies as a Non-Dockable Megaship?**

There are many Megaships – from the Prison Ships of the Independent Detention Foundation to the Pilots Federation Rescue Ships, from the Superpowers Capital Ships to Brewer Corporation Drake Class Carriers, from the Generation Ships to Tiliala’s Lament of the Exiled Conservatives of Tiliala.
Some of those are dockable or have exampels of being dockable, and are therefore not in scope of this introduction. Some are not dockable (Dredgers for example), but miss certain features: for example having a fixed route of waypoints (see below).

This introduction only looks at those Non-Dockable Megaships having fixed waypoints, on which they travel bi-weekly. They jump every 14 days on Thursday. **In the following we will only talk about those as “Megaships”, and drop the “Non-Dockable” for brevity.**

**2. How to find Megaships?**

*Few Megaships* are auto-resolved after jumping into a system. *Most Megaships* are revealed after a Nav-Beacon-Scan when returning to supercruise. *All Megaships* are revealed after a FSS-scan of the body they are orbiting\*.

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/n7vDcVu-Imgur-1024x576.png)*Fig. 2.1: Bandwith of a Megaships FSS Signal.*

After its signal is resolved the megaships type and call-sign can be found in the Navigation Panel with a distinct icon. 

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/13-DHLRTFB.jpg)*Fig. 2.2: Megaship Navigation Panel Icon*

*\_\_\_\* The reason for this unknown. A similar behaviour is known from Ressource Extraction Sites. Selling exploration data of the FSS scan does not change it.*

**3. How many and which Megaships are there?**

As the time of writing, there are 7426 megaships recorded\*. They come in 23 Types. [This link to the Codex lists all megaship-classes](https://canonn.science/tag/megaship-class/).  None of the types is extraordinary more rare or abundant than the others.

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MegashipsbyClass.png)*Figure 3.1: Types of Megaships*

Dropping to real-space at the megaship its Sub-Type is shown under contacts. There are 7 sub-types, with Bulk Cargo Ships being the most abundant, and Survey Vessels being the rarest:

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MegashipsbySubType.png)*Figure 3.2: Classes of Megaships*

\_\_\_
*\* All of the statistics of total numbers of megaships have been drawn from CMDR Syleo excellent tool  https://elite.laulhere.com/ExTool/, which  uses Canonns EDMC plug-in data.*

**4. Sub-targets**

After a scan of a Megaship contact with a Ships Data-Link-Scanner there are Sub-targets revealed. No megaship-type has all Sub-targets, and the distance from which they show depends on a ships sensor class and grade (and engineering).

Some of the Sub-targets can reveal further sub-targets after a Data-Link-Scan from close by.

***4.1. Ship Log Uplink***

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/9-zifN6gJ.jpg)*Figure 4.1.1: Ship Log Uplink*

A Data-Link-Scan of a Ship Log Uplink results in a message in the ships Inbox interface with the megaships Flight Operations Plan. It lists all 6 waypoints and marks the current with “(\*)”.

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/yoyVp0I.png)*Figure 4.1.2 Example of an – albeit extraordinary – Flight Operations Plan*

If you want to know at which of their waypoints all megaships are: the Canonn-controlled system of Wikmeang has at all time at least one Megaship present. Scan the Shiplog-Uplink with your Data-Link-Scanner to find out which is the current waypoint number for all megaships.

***4.2 Fighter Bay***

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3-efRAzNv.jpg)*Figure 4.2.1 Fighter Bay*

There are no subtargets of it\*.
\_\_
*\* And nobody has seen it in use ever.* 

***4.3 Power Generator***

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8-gRaa4CU.png)*Figures 4.3.1 Power Generator*

Can be destroyed by Weapons or Ramming. Often attacked during a Raid (see 6.).

***4.4. Automated Defence Turrett***

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/12-CQwCkbH.jpg)*Figure 4.4.1 Automated Defence Turrett*

Automated Defence Turrets are Numbered from 0-x.

Data-Link-Scan of an Automated Defence Turrett reveals a Subtarget Defense System Generator for that Turrett, which can be close by or further away. 

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/10-qQs9IwI-1024x1024.jpg)*Figure 4.4.2 Defense System Generator*

This subtarget can be attacked or rammed to take the Automated Defence Turret temporarily offline – an objective of some common missions\*.
\_\_\_
*\*Firing on it brings a bounty in the local jurisdiction, ramming does not.*

***4.5 Hackable Data Transmitter***

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/7-pLaag1c.jpg)*Figure 4.5.1: Hackable Data Transmitter*

A Data-Link-Scan reveals a Subtarget Limpet Docking Point a Recon-Limpet-Controller can target\*. 

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6-mUdZi8q.jpg)*Figure 4.5.2: Hackable data Transmitter Limpet Docking Point*

After a successfull hack a commander gets Data in their inventory, which can be used for engineering.
\_\_\_
*\*If silent running is engaged before the limpet attaches to the Limpet Docking Point and during the full time of the hack there is no bounty or fine attached to it, but it will report a crime anyways to local system security, which will show up.*

***4.6 Hackable Comms Array***

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-7p4xU8a.jpg)*Figure 4.6.1: Hackable Comms Array*

A Data-Link-Scan reveals a Subtarget Limpet Docking Point a Recon-Limpet-Controller can target\*.

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/4-0VnQwet.png)*Figure 4.6.1: Hackable Comms Array Limpet Docking Point*

After a successfull hack there are Data materials to be found close by, which can be collected with a collector-limpet or Cargo Hatch.

\_\_\_

*\*If silent running is engaged before the limpet attaches to the Limpet Docking Point and during the full time of the hack there is no bounty or fine attached to it, but it will report a crime anyways to local system security, which will show up.*

***4.7 Cargo Bay and Escape Hatch***

Cargo Bays and Escape Hatches are functionally identical, and numbered together from 0-x.

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-kaq82tI.jpg)*Figures 4.7.1: Cargo Bay*

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/11-gjGClEX.jpg)*4.7.2: Escape Hatch*

After a Data-Link-Scan has finished, a Manifest Scanner can temporarily reveal a Bays or Hatches Cargo under Contacts/Target.

A Subtarget Limpet Docking Point is revealed, which a Hatchbreaker-Limpet-Controller can target to extract Cargo\*. 

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-9lP5Q6V.jpg)*Figure 4.7.3: Cargo Bay and Escape Hatch Limpet Docking Point*

After several Hatchbreaks the Cargo Bay or Escape Hatch stops working.

\_\_\_

*\*If silent running is engaged before the limpet attaches to the Limpet Docking Point and during the full time of the hack there is no bounty or fine attached to it, but it will report a crime anyways to local system security, which will show up, and can fine for stolen cargo or destroy the Cargo still floating around.*

**5. Megaship Cargo**

***5.1 Bulk-Commodities***

Each Megaship Class has its fixed Bulk-Commodities in its Cargo Bays – its Default Cargo. While the total amount\* of each Commodity can vary a bit, the type of commodity does not. 

Neither legality, state of the controlling faction, population size, economic size, economy of waypoint or first waypoint have any effect. 

Attacked Megaships have a different manifest. A non-attacked megaship showing any different Bulk Commodity than its default cargo is attacked shortly afterwards as part of a Raid. (see 6.)

***Example:** A Gordon-class Hauler has around 280 tons in its single Cargo Bay.  You might find 250t or 300t. It transports Industrial Materials and Metals. Of Industrial Materials it has Insulating Membrane, Neofabric Insulation, Semiconductors – not any of the other Industrial Materials, Polymers for exampel. Of Metals it only has Beryllium, Copper, Gallium, Lithium, Palladium, Silver, Tantalum, and Titanium – not any other, Cobalt for example. If you find e.g. Osmium in a Gordon-class Haulers Cargo Bay it will be raided shortly afterwards.*

For a list of which specific commodities a Megaship-class has please check out the single post on each Megaship-class in the codex.

***5.2 Rare Commodities***

Almost all Megaships have a low tonnage of Rare Goods in their Cargo Bays. Those Rare Goods are fixed by Category, but not by Commodity in most cases\*\*.

Legality, distance to a Rares production, or whether they are in production at all have no effect\*\*\*.

***Example:** A Gordon-class Hauler has a low tonnage of Rare Commodities of the Metals category. It can have all or some of any Rare Commodity of that Caegory, which are: Cherbones Blood Crystals, Helvetitj Pearls, Ngandandari Fire Opals, Platinum Alloy, Sothis Crystalline Gold\*\*\*\*.*

\_\_\_

*\*which can be zero for Commodities having a low tonnage of that specific commodity in the default cargo.*

*\*\* Prison Ships are a prominent exception to this rule. They only ever have Honesty Pills in their Cargo Bays, which are classified as Medicines, never one of the other Rare Good Medicines.*

*\*\*\*So … does that mean a Rare blocked since forever like Wolf Fesh can be stolen from Megaship-classes having Rares of the Legal Drugs Category?* ***Yes, this is exactly what it means.***

*\*\*\*\*I know… neither Crystals nor Pearls nor Opals should be in the Metals Category, but hey – they are. And there is no Category of Rare Minerals.*

***5.3 Table of Megaship Bulk- and Rare-Cargo by Categories***

**6. Raids and Attacks**

A Megaship can get raided or attacked by competing factions, an event commonly referred to as a Scenario. During such a Raid or Attack an independent commander is asked – but is not forced to do so – to either help the defending or the attacking side in the comms panel – similar to conflictzones.

During a Raid or Attack there are objectives issued and waves announced, if a commander has chosen to side.

Succesfully defending or attacking a megaship when choosing a side increases reputation with the faction the commander is siding with, and decreases reputation with the other faction.

A succesfull defense or attack also effects the factions economy, security and in-system influence, independently whether a commander chose a side.

There is good evidence a systems security level, controlling faction states, and type of megaship make such a Raid or Attack more likely, alas the political data scientists of Thompson Dokc have not produced any statistics on that (yet).

***Example:*** *In a low security system, with the controlling faction being in boom, a Gordon-class Hauler, megaship of the subtype Bulk Cargo Ship, will almost always get raided in a short timeframe. While in a High Security System, with the controlling faction being in no state, an Alcatraz Reformatory, megaship of the subtype Prison Ship, will not get raided even if you wait for hours.*
