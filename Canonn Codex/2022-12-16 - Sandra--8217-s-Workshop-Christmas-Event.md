*Pilots’ Federation ALERT*

Sandra Corrs, CEO of the largest manufacturer of children’s toys in the core systems, has requested help this holiday season.

Many parents will be familiar with Sandra’s Workshop, recognising the company logo stamped across countless datapads, interactive suites and tactile play sets designed for youngsters. But the joy of this year’s festive season is at risk, with the recent Thargoid invasion impacting the Workshop’s distribution chain.

In an interview with Vox Galactica, Corrs explained:

“We typically use a fleet of transports provided by our partner company, Dolph’s Routes, to deliver presents to good children all across the bubble. But those transports have been assigned to provide evacuation support to 63 Tauri. Entirely understandable, and I applaud the company for its brave work. But it does leave many presents without a sleigh, as my grandfather used to say!”

“I’m hoping that independent pilots will fill the vacancy left to deliver festive gifts to the children in time for the upcoming holidays. Arrangements will be made to provide a variety of wonderful rewards for those pilots who help keep youthful spirits high in these troubling times.”

Pilots willing to help Sandra’s Workshop can collect festive gifts from the Frost Dock outpost in the Njambalba system. A beacon outside Frost Dock will distribute delivery information when scanned.
```

The Article directs players to Frost Dock, an outpost (no large landing pads) in Njambalba. The station is located 32,000 Ls from the star.
When the player docks at the port they will receive in their inbox: “Message from Sandra Corrs”, from Sandra ‘Coors’.

The message informs the player of a beacon outside the station (located near fox vision) with letters from children across the bubble. It asks you to scan the beacon to be given the letters and warns you that you’ll have to figure out where the sender lives, as “it can sometimes be confusing.”

The player is asked to collect the **“Festive Gifts”** from the commodity market at Frost dock. The commodity is a rare good, available in batches of 24 (only 6 are needed.)
Once the player has scanned the beacon “Sandra’s Postbox”, which is a listening post, they will receive 6 messages from children asking for presents. Each message contains hints for where the player must deliver the Festive Gifts. Once the player has worked out the stations, they must sell one of the Festive Gifts to the station **commodity market**. If the station was correct, they will receive a message in their inbox detailing their reward.

## MESSAGE ONE – HELENA LEMURA, AGE 9

- System: Wyrd
- Station: Bokeili Station

```
Helena Lemura, Age 9 

‘Dear Sandra,

I have been a very good girl this year. All my classwork was completed on time. I helped Daddy with changing tommy in the mornings. I even ate all of the horrible stew Mummy makes on Wednesdays!

She keeps saying it’s a ‘Bokeili Special’ bit it tastes so WEIRD. I know Mummy loves making it for us so I finish mine every week.

I’d like a full box of special flavourings I can sneak into my bowl when she’s not looking. Then I’d look forward to Wednesdays as much as Mummy does.

Thank you!’
```

The target station for this was found thanks to the mention of the “**Bokeili special**”, which she describes as “WEIRD”. Searching the Galmap reveals that there are many stations who’s name starts with Bokeili, but **BOKEILI STATION** in **WYRD** is the solution. (“Wyrd” rhymes with “weird”). Selling one of the Festive Gifts to the commodity market will reward the player with:

- Type-9 Snowfall Chestnut paint job
- Festive Firework Launcher (Red), placed in local storage

## MESSAGE TWO – PADDY GOBERT, AGE 11

- System: Wolf 397
- Station: Cregglezone

```
Paddy Gobert, Age 11 

‘HELLO SANDRA

I WOULD LIKE THE LATEST INSIGHT GAME CALLED ‘MEDAL OF DUTY 142’ PLEASE BECAUSE MY STUPID FRIEND COLIN KEEPS BEATING ME AT ‘MEDAL OF DUTY 141’ AND SAYING HE’S THE BEST PLAYER ON CREGGLEZONE

SO IF I GET THE LATEST VERSION BEFORE HIM I CAN PRACTICE THEN BEAT HIM UNTIL HE HAS ANOTHER TANTRUM LIKE LAST YEAR WHEN HE LOST TO HIS SISTER AT MONOPOLY SIX TIMES IN A ROW’
```

The target station for this was found as the station is directly named by the sender “**CREGGLEZONE**” **CREGGLEZONE** is located in **WOLF 397**. Selling one of the Festive Gifts to the commodity market will reward the player with:

- Krait Phantom Snowfall Chestnut paint job
- Festive Firework Launcher (Yellow), placed in local storage

## MESSAGE THREE – GARETH BRUNN, AGE 6

- System: Bento
- Station: Snow Moon

```
Gareth Brunn, Age 6

‘Dear Sandra,

Please may I have a moon with some snow on it. My sister keeps telling there is no snow on our moon so I want to give one to her. My sister is very nice to me and I love her very much.’
```

This station was found as the child is asking for a moon with snow on it. Searching the galmap for “**SNOW MOON**” reveals a station in Bento called Snow Moon. **SNOW MOON** in **BENTO** is the target station. Selling one of the Festive Gifts to the commodity market will reward the player with:

- Diamondback Explorer Snowfall Chestnut paint job
- Festive Firework Launcher (Green), placed in local storage

## MESSAGE FOUR – DARCY DRAPER, AGE 7

- System: Mizar
- Station: Judson Station

```
Darcy Draper, Age 7

‘Dear Sandra,

I keep seeing these beautiful flowers on the newsfeeds and it makes me want to draw! My friends laugh at me when I say that, but I think they’re pretty

My Judson datapad broke when my little brother dropped it in the toilet - please can you sent me a new one? I promise I’ll do a drawing of the station and the flowers for you. Thank you Sandra!’
```

This station was found as the message mentions a “**Judson datapad**”. Searching for **JUDSON** in the Galmap again reveals that there are many stations with that name. **JUDSON STATION** in **MIZAR** is the target station. This was found as the station is notably far from the star, at 160,000 Ls. It is also a high-tech economy station (Judson datapad). Selling one of the Festive Gifts to the commodity market will reward the player with:

- Anaconda Snowfall Chestnut paint job
- Festive Gifts Ornament bobblehead

## MESSAGE FIVE – HINTAK THORPE, AGE 9

- System: Epsilon Indi
- Station: London Relay

```
Hintak Thorpe, Age 9 

To Mrs Sandra,

I’ve been learning about historical entertainment at school this month. My teacher took the class to a museum with some ancient con-soles. They must have been very old because I’ve never seen anything like them before! There was a special room where we could play some old games, and my favourite one was called Race to London. 

I want to build my own con-sole and play it some more. Please send me the parts to make one!’
```

This station was found thanks to the game name “Race to **London**”. There are only 2 places with the name **London**, and only one is a station. The station called **LONDON RELAY** in **EPSILON INDI** is the target station. A **relay** is also a type of race. Selling one of the Festive Gifts to the commodity market will reward the player with:

- Snowman Helmet
- Santa Jumper Green

## MESSAGE SIX – ELLIE WINEMAN, AGE 10

- System: Alpha Centauri
- Station: Hutton Orbital

```
Ellie Wineman, Age 10

‘Dear Sandra, 

I’m about to turn 11 and I would really like a starship race track. I never got a big present before because Eden is so far away from everything that nobody ever brings nice toys out here. I just get a new mug every year! That’s why I wanted to ask you. I heard you make the best toys and Mom says that you won’t send anything if I don’t tell you.

Please please please send one of your ships out here, it would make this the best holiday ever!’
```

This message complains that they don’t get big presents where they live, **Eden**, because it is so far away from everything. The target station for this **HUTTON ORBITAL** in **ALPHA CENTAURI**. This station was found because **Eden** is a planet in **Alpha Centauri** that orbits extremely far from the entry star. They also mention just getting a **mug** every year – which is a hint at the location, as the **Hutton Mug** is a rare commodity sold at **Hutton Orbital**. Eden is the planet that **Hutton Orbital** orbits. Selling one of the Festive Gifts to the commodity market will reward the player with:

- 20,000,000 credits
