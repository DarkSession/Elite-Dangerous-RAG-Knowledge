## Velasquez Medical Research Centre

Published: 19 Oct 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/velasquez-medical-research-centre/)

Content: Velasquez Medical Research Centre is an abandoned settlement in the LP 389-95 system, on body 7, at -30.8066, 138.6209 (in Live/4.0) or at 57.9674, 50.0336 (in Legacy/3.8).

The location of this facility was given in the logs found at [Hogan Depot](https://canonn.science/codex/hogan-depot/).

It was operated by the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm (INRA), a co-operative between the Federation and Empire that operated during the last war with the Thargoids. This facility appears to have had connections to the project that created the mycoid used against the Thargoids, operating as a medical research laboratory.

The vaccine for the mycoid agent was developed here.

The facility contains a number of habitation modules, hangar or barracks buildings, and large tanks marked with the symbol for the mycoid weapon; the ground is stained in a manner consistent with leakage of the agent.

Within the facility there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

## Logs

Around the facility there are five Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives some of the history of the INRA:

> 
> I don’t know who they were, exactly. Some corporate bigwigs. But they definitely convinced the board.
> 
> I can’t say I’m surprised. They offered a lot of money for access to our labs apparently. The board probably didn’t even ask what they wanted them for.
> 
> At least I got the bosses to promise the lab wouldn’t be used to make biological weapons. This is a medical facility, after all. I will not be bullied into participating in this so-called war just because some corporation gave us their money.

> 
> **VACCINE 2/5**
> …Bypassing security protocols…
> …Secure connection established…
> 
> Personal Log: Kiona Li, Senior Medical Officer
> 
> It turns out they want us to make some kind of vaccine, an antidote for an unnamed biological weapon.
> 
> They’ve given us samples and data, but whenever we press for more information our requests are met with silence. We re working in the dark. With our hands tied behind our backs.
> 
> In practical terms we’ve got everything we could need, but I have no idea where half of it comes from. They’ve given us material the weapon has been tested on, both organic and inorganic, human and nonhuman.
> 
> I’m starting to wonder if the weapon is even designed to target humans.

> 
> **VACCINE 3/5**
> …Bypassing security protocols…
> …Secure connection established…
> 
> Personal Log: Kiona Li, Senior Medical Officer
> 
> We’ve finally been given access to a sample of the weapon, and it’s opened up all kinds of avenues.
> 
> I still worry about the ease with which our benefactors acquired the samples, but I’m probably just being paranoid. They obviously have deep pockets. Having access to unlimited funds must open all kinds of doors.

> 
> **VACCINE 4/5**
> …Bypassing security protocols…
> …Secure connection established…
> Personal Log: Kiona Li, Senior Medical Officer
> 
> After months of research the solution ended up being pretty simple. Once you break it down it’s a fairly straightforward organic compound – little more than a fungus, really.
> 
> We tested the vaccine on some of the older samples, and while it doesn’t undo any existing damage, it does prevent the weapon from doing any further harm.
> 
> Our sponsors certainly seem happy.

> **VACCINE 5/5**
> …Bypassing security protocols…
> …Secure connection established…
> Personal Log: Kiona Li, Senior Medical Officer
> 
> The lab is being dismantled. Seems our sponsors want to move us to a new location. Their representatives appeared a few days ago, demanded that all data be transferred to their servers and all samples be put into storage, ready to be moved.
> 
> Why are they doing this? The lab more than meets our needs – they made sure of it. I tried to talk to them, but I just got stonewalled. Apparently all information is on a need-to-know basis. And I don’t need to know.

This base does not point to another INRA location. The next location, [Almeida Landing](https://canonn.science/codex/almeida-landing/), was found via an Unregistered Comms Beacon.
