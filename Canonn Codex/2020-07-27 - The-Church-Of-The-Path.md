> Missing pilot lsla Elmasri was recently found in a crashed Sidewinder by a salvage company based on 2042 L1 in the Alpha Centauri system. Asked about the rescue, a member of the salvage team g commented:
> 
> “It was blind luck that we found the ship. We were following latitude 69.2 and then – blam! There it was at ~127.25. If there had been no one aboard it would have been a decent payday. But we’re not pirates, and when we found a survivor we called it in.”

> Elmasri was transferred to a medical installation in Barnard’s Star, and is said to be recovering well. The pilot claims to have escaped from a cult called the Disciples of Maarg, which is allegedly based somewhere in the Shibboleth system.

> Security forces have advised pilots to avoid the area and report any suspicious activity.

> We’ve been lied to all this time. No one truly ascends. We toil under false truths and when the time comes these chosen ones. the ones that have given everything. are simply fodder for the slavers. Sold like so much cheap meat. One last contribution to the path. Isn’t it curious that none of the senior brothers have ever ascended. Those that preach and deliver false truths. They remain.

> Elmasri in particular has become the thorn that digs into our flesh. She must be brought back to the path or silenced. Maybe we can accelerate her path to ascension.
> Yes, yes. Sister Elmasri will ascend.
