## Caucuma Unregistered Comms Beacon

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/caucuma-unregistered-comms-beacon/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Caucuma system, orbiting body 10 d. 

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be on the hour, every 3 hours, with transmissions reported at: 00:00 / 03:00 / 06:00 / 09:00 / 12:00 / 15:00 / 18:00 / 21:00.

The transmitted message is the following:

> 
> 4 1 14 7 5 18 15 21 19
> (repeated four times)

Decodes by letter positions to:

> 
> DANGEROUS

This message is the decryption key for an encoded Galnet article in the local Herald:

> hotel echo mike juliet kilo echo –  1 alpha – hotel delta november juliet india victor juliet yankee – quebec uniform mike echo delta quebec 4

The message consists of a series of words that can be interpreted as the NATO phonetic alphabet, yielding the message:

> 
> hemjke-1a-hdnjivjy-qumedq4

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of DANGEROUS taken from the beacon yielded the message:

> 
> merope-1b-maconvoy-threat4

Unfortunately, the expected Signal Source POI is not present around body 1 b, in the Merope system.

However, there is a Listening post orbiting body 1 b, which leads to the [HIP 14909 Distress Call](https://canonn.science/codex/hip-14909-distress-call).
