Content: An Ancient Probe named “Voyager 1” that was launched from Earth, continues its journey into the stars, and can be found 2,317,435 Ls from Sol in the direction of the Beronii system.

The Ghost Giraffe has [video instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-D2Nz5Vx2M) for locating it, with reference star charts for precise location.

Note that the signal source containing the probe is the “Ancient Probe” source, the “Voyager” signal source is, in fact, a Tourist Beacon.

Voyager 1 broadcasts audio greetings in multiple dialects which your ship’s sensors can receive when you target it, and the probe itself carries the famous Voyager Plaque.
