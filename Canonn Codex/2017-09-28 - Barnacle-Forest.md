## Barnacle Forest

Published: 28 Sep 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/barnacle-forest/)

Content: There are a number of locations where barnacles can be found in large numbers. These are know as barnacle forests. Scanning the body with the full spectrum scanner will show that the body has Thargoid signals. Scanning the body with the surface scanner will allow the individual barnacle sites to show up on the navigation panel. There is nothing on the navigation panel to distinguish between common barnacle sites and the barnacle forests.

The forests come in three different sizes. All have a large central Barnacle with common barnacles radiating out. The smallest has just nine barnacles and the largest has 35. Only the large forests will have Thargoid Scavengers.

Barnacle forests are one of the few remaining locations where it is possible to consistently harvest meta-alloys. The smaller forests are a little easier to navigate and locate the meta-alloy pods and daylight is easier than night.

Thargoid interceptors frequently visit the forests and appear to be harvesting the barnacles, though they do leave the meta-alloy pods behind even when detached. When the interceptor is harvesting, any loose material will be pulled upwards including any SRVs that happen to be close by.Â  Once the harvest is complete the debris will fall back to the ground.

The Barnacle Forests in Outotz ST-I d9-6 2 a, do not seem to have the same planetary conditions as the others and none of the Barnacles nor the Barnacle barbs yield any logs when they are composition scanned.
