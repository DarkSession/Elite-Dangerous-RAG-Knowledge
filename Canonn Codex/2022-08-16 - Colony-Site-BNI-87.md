> The old codger says he won’t move. I’ve told him that technically we own the planet, but he just shouts that it’s his home and he’s been here for years.
> 
> Right now I don’t know what to do short of sending in the eviction team.

> **EVICTION NOTICE 2/3**
> Comms Record:
> 
> Sir, please see reason. This planet is owned by my employers, you have no location rights. If you don’t come out, we’re going to have to come in to remove you by force.
> 
> We don’t want to have to do that.
