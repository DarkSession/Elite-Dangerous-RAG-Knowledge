Published: 23 Jan 2023 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/pilots-memorials/)

Content: These memorials are placed in 7 systems in human occupied space, each containing a full list of all submitted memorial names. 

| System | Body |
| --- | --- |
| Achenar | Capitol ( 6 d ) |
| Alioth | Turner’s World ( 5 b ) |
| Asellus Primus | 3 |
| Colonia | 4 |
| Dromi | 1 |
| Shinrarta Dezhra | Founders World ( 4 ) |
| Sol | Earth ( 3 ) |

Names can be submitted via a [custom request portal](https://customersupport.frontier.co.uk/hc/en-us/articles/4408895569938-In-Game-Memorials). The exact list will not be detailed here, as they are long (currently split between 9 messages) and updated every few months.

The memorials consist of single Listening Post (previously there 4 Listening Post’s, each with separate Point of Interest), upon scanning the Listening Post you will receive multiple messages in your inbox (currently 9, as of Mar 3310).

- Pilots’ Memorial 0-9 A-B
- Pilots’ Memorial C-E
- Pilots’ Memorial F-H
- Pilots’ Memorial I-K
- Pilots’ Memorial L-N
- Pilots’ Memorial O-Q
- Pilots’ Memorial R-T
- Pilots’ Memorial U-W
- Pilots’ Memorial X-Z

Each message starts with the following:

> 
> Remembering those lost to us in life, in the knowledge they will live forever amongst the stars.

Followed by a list of newline-separated memorialized names, whose first letter of their first name falls in the range for the respective listening post. Sometimes, multiple names will appear on the same line; in this case, the first name in the list is used for sorting. Some names are prefixed with “CMDR”, indicating that they are a Commander name and not a real name.

Canonn wishes peace to those and their loved ones memorialized by these beacons. Godspeed.
