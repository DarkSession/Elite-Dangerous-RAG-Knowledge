> 
> The ship is a wreck but if I’m going to live out here I’m going to have to use the mission supplies to make this place habitable. It won’t be pretty but it should keep me alive.

> The mission supplies got me started and I’ve managed to build a reasonable base camp from the ship wreckage.

> Life is hard, but right now it’s enough to be alive.

> It’s been years since the crash. I still have dreams about it. Nothing solid, but I’m left with the feeling that something greater than myself had a hand in saving me. 
> I’m not a religious man and I know it sounds very hocus pocus. But I believe there is something out there watching over us.
