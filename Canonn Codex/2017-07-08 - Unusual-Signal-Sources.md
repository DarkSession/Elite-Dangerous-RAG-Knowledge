## Unusual Signal Sources

Published: 08 Jul 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/unusual-signal-sources/)

Content: As you fly through space, your ship’s scanners are always searching for nearby signal sources. They will appear on your Navigation Panel when your ship is within 1,000 Ls of them. Explorers are suggested to regularly check their Navigation Panel when traversing a system to perform surface scans, and report anything unusual.

While most signal sources are temporal in nature, reflecting the dynamic nature of the galaxy, a small number are persistent; they can always be found in the same place, by anyone. These are in addition to those located from [Unregistered Comms Beacons](https://canonn.science/codex/unregistered-comms-beacons/).

### Known Signal Sources

The signal source contains an orange Sidewinder from which Lave Radio is broadcast.

We now have a wealth of data plotting the extent of Thargoid incursions.

However the nature of the Thargoid Threat has changed substantially since they have entered the bubble. Previously we would be able to tell from the threat levels what type of Thargoid vessels we would encounter but now it is not possible to distinguish a Medusa from a dozen scouts using automated equipment alone.

Given the changing nature of the threat, and the success of the previous program, Canonn R&D have upgraded the USS-Survey device to provide some additional features.
