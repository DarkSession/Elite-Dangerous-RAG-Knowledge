## Silurion Anomalous Signal

Published: 10 Nov 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/silurion-anomalous-signal/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Silurion system, orbiting body 2 a. 

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be on the hour, every 3 hours, with transmissions reported at: 00:00 / 03:00 / 06:00 / 09:00 / 12:00 / 15:00 / 18:00 / 21:00.

The transmitted message is the following:

> 
> 4 1 14 7 5 18 15 21 19
> (repeated four times)

Decodes by letter positions to:

> 
> DANGEROUS

This message is the decryption key for an encoded Galnet article in the local Herald:

> Mike November Delta Mike Uniform Mike Foxtrot Echo
> Bravo Uniform

The message consists of a series of words that can be interpreted as the NATO phonetic alphabet, yielding the message:

> 
> INQHFNGC-4J-WEBSGCIAEBQEF-MNDMUMFEBU

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of DANGEROUS taken from the beacon yielded the message:

> 
> SILURION-4B-WEAPONSDEALER-HIGHTHREAT

This leads to a “Anomalous Signal Detected” signal source in the Silurionsystem, orbiting body 4 b. This appears to be a permanent convoy of a Type-9 Heavy, accompanied by Type-7s and Sidewinders identical to the weapons convoys seen in other systems during periods of War.
