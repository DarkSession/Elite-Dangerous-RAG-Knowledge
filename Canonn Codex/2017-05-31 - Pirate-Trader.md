## Pirate Trader

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/pirate-trader/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Unelinte system, orbiting body 4.

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be on the hour, every 4 hours, with transmissions reported at: 00:00 / 04:00 / 08:00 / 12:00 / 16:00 / 20:00. 

The transmitted message is the following:

> 
> 10 1 3 11 16 15 20
> (repeated four times)

Decodes by letter positions to:

> 
> JACKPOT

This message is the decryption key for an encoded Galnet article in the local Herald:

The message consists of a series of words that can be interpreted as the NATO phonetic alphabet, yielding the message:

> 
> CSUCNTTJCGFSFI-TH4-6-SNTDY-ENSBGJGSBIJS-EOBQJG5C

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of JACKPOT taken from the beacon yielded the message:

> 
> CRUCISSECTOROD-SB4-6-RISKY-PIRATETRADER-PLANET5C

This leads to a “Pirate Trader” signal source in the Crucis Sector OD-S b4-6 system, in orbit of body 5 c. The signal source contains a wanted Type 9, which will initiate an attack without comms.
