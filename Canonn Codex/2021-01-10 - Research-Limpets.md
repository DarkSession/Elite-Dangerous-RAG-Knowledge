**A Brief History of Limpets**

Limpets are disposable, consumable, drones developed by Manticore. They are incredibly versatile such that any limpet can be programmed to fill a variety or roles yet standardized to fit in the same footprint as a standardized cargo canister. Each limpet is equipped with a standardized hardware package including a 3D thruster suite for maneuverability and propellant tanks. Specialized equipment allowing any limpet to serve in any of the following roles is also present: Collected, Decontamination, Fuel Transfer, Hatch Breaker, Recon, Prospector, Repair, and Research.

**Research Limpets**

As previously stated, the universal limpet can be programmed to collect samples from various sources found in our galaxy using a Research Limpet Controller. These have been used to extract tissue samples from Thargoids (be warned, this often provokes a hostile response) and other biology found in what the Pilots Federation collectively classified as Notable Stellar Phenomena. To date, only one variety of Research Limpet Controller, the 1E, is available on the market and no Engineer has attempted any modifications/upgrades to the controller. The 1E controller limits the limpet to 300 seconds of operation and can only be operated up to a max distance of two kilometers from the pilot. Once the sample is collected, the limpet will deposit it into the ship’s cargo hold prior to self termination. 

The following contains a comprehensive list of all available samples obtainable by the research limpet provided by the most dedicated of Canonn’s Boffins as well as where to find them. 

**Mollusc Samples**

Molluscs are space-faring non-sapient creatures that share the common traits of obtaining energy through a process similar to photosynthesis and have a hardened shell to protect them from the harsh space environments.

**Pod Samples**

Pods are seed carrying space-faring organisms that share some of the qualities of terrestrial plants. In most cases these pods are connected to a space-faring tree of the same name.

Note: Albidum Collard Pods are not consider valid targets at this time 3307.01.09 

**Thargoid Samples**

Thargoids are an intelligent, highly advanced insectoid species that have existed for millions of years to the point that they were still a highly advanced space-faring species when the Guardians first interacted with them over a million years ago. Their ships, interceptors and scouts, can be sampled by the research limpet due to their bio-mechanical nature. The Thargoids do not react kindly to their ships being sampled but fortunately Canonn has put together this [handy guide](https://canonn.science/codex/thargoid-tissue-sampling-techniques) to help in your research efforts.

| Sample | Thargoid Source |
| --- | --- |
| Thargoid Scout Tissue Sample | [Thargoid Scout](https://canonn.science/codex/thargoids/) |
| Thargoid Cyclops Tissue Sample | [Cyclops class Thargoid Interceptor](https://canonn.science/codex/thargoids/) |
| Thargoid Basilisk Tissue Sample | [Basilisk class Thargoid Interceptor](https://canonn.science/codex/thargoids/) |
| Thargoid Medusa Tissue Sample | [Medusa class Thargoid Interceptor](https://canonn.science/codex/thargoids/) |
| Thargoid Hydra Tissue Sample | [Hydra class Thargoid Interceptor](https://canonn.science/codex/thargoids/) |

Note: Thargoid samples are corrosive and will require a Corrosion Resistant Cargo Rack to transport.

**Anomaly Samples**

Anomalies are the oddities of the space-fairing forms of life we find. Unlike most of the fungal based life that we have found, anomalies seem to be some new classification of energy based lifeform. Additional studies are required.

| Sample | Anomaly Source |
| --- | --- |
| Anomaly Particles | Unknown |

Note: While acknowledged as a tradeable salvage commodity by the Pilots Federation standardized trade interface, there is currently no known way to obtain Anomaly Particles. While the Research Limpet Controller will target the anomaly, the research limpet will not make contact as if the anomaly is immaterial. It is unknown if the limpets do not have sufficient equipment to capture a sample from these objects at this time or if we are not using the proper sampling techniques. 

**No Samples**

The following samples have attempted to be taken without success. Research is ongoing, 

Microorganism Clusters

| Sample Source | Results |
| --- | --- |
| Calciate Plate | Not considered a valid target |
| Ice Crystal | Not considered a valid target |
| Silicate Crystal | Not considered a valid target |
| Metallic Crystal | Not considered a valid target |
| Lattice Mineral Sphere | Not considered a valid target |
| Solid Mineral Sphere | Not considered a valid target |

Note: These structures were constructed by clusters of microorganisms in a similar fashion to coral on ancient Earth. They themselves are not alive and while considerably massive, the Research Limpet Controller does not consider them valid targets due to the insignificant biomass of the individual microorganisms.  

Trees

| Sample Source | Results |
| --- | --- |
| Aster Tree | Not considered a valid target |
| Gyre Tree | Not considered a valid target |
| Peduncle Tree | Not considered a valid target |
| Stolon Tree | Not considered a valid target |
| Void Heart | Not considered a valid target |

Note: While these are considered living plant-like organisms, like their respective seed pods, and are considerably massive, the Research Limpet Controller does not consider them valid targets.  

Surface Life

| Sample Source | Results |
| --- | --- |
| Amphora Plant | Research limpet unable to operate |
| Anemone | Research limpet unable to operate |
| Bark Mound | Research limpet unable to operate |
| Brain Tree | Research limpet unable to operate |
| Sinuous Tuber | Research limpet unable to operate |
| Thargoid Barnacle | Research limpet unable to operate |
| Scavenger | Research limpet unable to operate |
| Thargoid Pod | Research limpet unable to operate |

Note: While these are living organisms the Research Limpet is unable to sample them to due their weak thrusters only intended to work in zero-G. On any surface body the limpets crash to the ground when deployed. 

If you’ve found another organism to sample with the Research Limpet or your findings are different then those presented here, feel free to contact Canonn with your documentation so we can update this document.
