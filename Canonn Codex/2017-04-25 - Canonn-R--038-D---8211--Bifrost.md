Content: Canonn R&D have conceived and delivered the interactive tool code named “Bifrost” to assist in the Guardians Ruins mystery.

Bifrost allows you to easily visualise and catalogue the many configurations of ancient Guardian Ruins. As more ruins are discovered, R&D needs help in maintaining the most detailed and comprehensive library of alien structures ever assembled.
