## Facece Military Installation

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/facece-military-installation/)

Content: A dual capital ship dock facility is in orbit above the planet Topaz in the Facece system.

Both contain Majestic-class Interdictors undergoing repairs, with both show signs of battle damage. Neither ship is broadcasting a transponder signal, or carries any identifying hull markings, so they cannot be individually identified.

Three Satellites are in the immediate area, giving Engineer Data when scanned.

Not of any known scientific interest.
