Content: The Pirate Cove Installation can be found in Kemurukamar around A 1. There is a Bowman-class Researcher at this location, the Blazin’ Dynamo. The Blazin’ Dynamo, and has been attacked. It has a Ship Log Uplink:

> 
> Virusalani Control,
> 
> 
> The Blazin’ Dynamo has been boarded by pirates and is in the Kemurukamar starsystem.
> 
> 
> I’ve evaded their base defences and connected to the data port near the bridge.
> 
> 
> A package designated simply as “Eli” has downloaded itself into my ship’s auxiliary storage.
> 
> 
> It almost leapt onboard!
> 
> 
> I’m returning it back to base.

Once you scan the Ship Log Uplink a duplicate Blazin’ Dynamo will appear in the Nav Panel.

The Pirate Cove was added for a section of the 2017 24 hour charity livestream as part of a segment where Dav followed clues, and is not known to have another purpose. There are ships that will scan you, and a Nav Beacon you can scan.
