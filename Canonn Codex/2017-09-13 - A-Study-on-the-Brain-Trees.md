## A Study on the Brain Trees

A further Brain Tree study by our very own [CMDR Maligno](https://canonn.science/user/maligno/)

It is well known in the community that Brain Trees [1] can grow material nodes that come in four varieties: Cordycep Growth, Polyporous Growth, Mussidaen Seed Pod, and Phloem Excretions. The purpose of this study is to get a qualitative understanding of the number of total material nodes of each type in a Brain Tree site as well as the materials that they yield [2].

For the purposes of this study material nodes were harvested at Brain Tree sites BT0192, BT0193, BT0189, and BT0194 [3]

It’s clear that each site generates between 40 and 50 material nodes, with Phloem Excretion and Cordycep Growth being the least and most abundant, respectively. There is a loose “20-15-10-5” pattern in the number of nodes.  Additionally, the following observations were made regarding the materials given by each type of node:

```
Cordycep Growth:    Grade 1 only
Polyporous Growth:  Grade 2-3 (e.g. Arsenic)
Mussidaen Seed Pod: Grade 3-4 
Phloem Excretion:   Grade 5 only (e.g. Polonium)
```

The big takeaway here is that Phloem Excretions are guaranteed to yield Grade 5 material.  This means that a commander willing to fly out to a Brain Tree site can harvest significant quantities the Grade 5 material that appears on that celestial body in a shorter time than hunting for Mesosiderites.  This is especially true of celestial bodies that host multiple Brain Trees sites (i.e. splash craters).  Brain Trees provide a viable alternative to gathering materials in a manner that mitigates the randomness associated with conventional prospecting.

It should noted that it takes between 30 to 40 minutes to harvest all of the material nodes in a Brain Tree site.  However, if one is only after Phloem Excretions then the harvesting time is only a few minutes.  One limiting factor is that, once harvested, Brain Tree sites take at least 2 weeks to regrow material nodes.  This document will be updated in the future with better respawn time estimates.

During the harvesting of the Brain Tree sites a number of additional observations were made:

1. ![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Elite_-_Dangerous_CLIENT_9_8_2017_4_33_45_PM_Wavescanner_Cropped_-_Copy-300x182.png)Sites vary in size and number of Brain Trees, but typically they occupy an area of around 1 square kilometer.
2. Sometimes more than one material node type will appear on a single tree.
3. Material nodes appear on the SRV wavescanner as a high-band signal very similar to a ship’s.A future study will be carried out in order to determine differences in the high-band signal depending on material node type.
4. Arsenic was only observed to come from Mussidaen Seed Pods, so it’s effective harvesting rate is probably not that much different than from Mesosiderites.

#### Summary and Outlook

Brain Trees were perhaps brought about by The Guardians as a resource gathering mechanism. The galactic community should take full advantage of Brain Trees because they provide a viable, if not superior, alternative to conventional prospecting activities.  Further studies will be carried out to get a more accurate understanding of material node abundances and yields.
