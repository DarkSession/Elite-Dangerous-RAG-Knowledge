*Photosynthetic organisms that have adapted to extreme conditions by reducing their surface area to volume ratio, thereby protecting more sensitive tissues from exposure. The outer layer is formed from specialised light-transmitting cells. These are filled with an insulating hydrophobic layer, which helps to maintain core temperature and liquid retention. Deep, extensive root structures hold the organisms in place, and facilitate the extraction of trace minerals. Some Cactoida Species feature explosive seed distribution as a method of reproduction.*

*Cactoida seem to favour flat or slightly undulating terrain, with the exception of Peperatis which appears to be a hill and low mountainside-loving Species*

*This Cactoida Species appears as a tall collection of cylinders linked by an undulating membrane and topped with a spiky crown. They often have a spiny life-form attached that is thought to form a symbiotic relationship with the larger organism, although the nature of this is not understood.* *Vermis is the  most heat-tolerant of Cactoida, as is to be expected given its requirement for a Water atmosphere, and far exceeds other Species of the Genus.*
