 Subject: Eagle Eye Report Week 28 & Gnosis Status Report - 14/09/3304

We shall begin with this weeks attacked station. Fortunately only one station this week has been damaged and will require repairs. Carpenter City in the Walgal system. Any pilots are requested to provide aid if possible. Evacuations are ongoing.

There are two targets in the human populated bubble which have been identified and decoded. Those targets are the UGP 145 system and the Agastani system. All types of alien signals have been detected and pilots are advised to proceed with caution entering these systems. 

The Gnosis has been again revealed to be “of interest” to the Thargoids, however there is no Thargoid activity around the Gnosis at the moment. Here’s hoping they dont try to interfere with our hyperspace corridor when we initiate our drives this coming Thursday.

Curiously, 1 more target 201 light years corewards of the Gnosis has been decoded. Independent pilots were immediately dispatched to this system which is Outotz BX-I C23-1. Investigations have shown a wrecked Lowell Class Science vessel bearing registration SHP-391 adrift near planet 2. At this time it is believed all hands were lost. Patrols do continue in the system. We do hope to find survivors.

All signal sources in this system contain the new Hydra variant of Thargoid interceptor. Pilots on patrol are advised to exercise extreme caution and to have an emergency jump protocol pre programmed into their nav comms.

Repairs aboard the Gnosis are complete thanks to the Hutton Truckers, who melted down their precious mugs to provide drive plates and other materials so that we may get back underway. A new course has been plotted and we await the green light from engineering to get underway as soon as possible.

And on a more personal note, I would like to challenge the pilots federation and AEGIS.

What do you know? Why are you not sharing what you know? What is so secret that it must be guarded?
