Content: The Hogan Class Bulk Cargo ship designation PTK-179 can be found in the Electra system orbiting body 6.

The ship has been attacked and shows signs of Thargoid damage.

A number of Engineer Materials / Cargo are scattered nearby, and a number of ships are in the area. Normally there will either be a fleet of rescue ships, or alternately a Thargoid vessel scanning and scooping cargo.

There is a Ship Uplink near the rings, but it does not seem to give a message.

It is believed that this is the ship that is referenced as the Aida in the Celeano Listening Post (though the ship designations do not match). This Listening Post pointed CMDRs to the Electra system which, at that time, was the first to contain Non-Human Signal Sources with Threat Level 6 ([Basilisk Thargoid Interceptors](https://canonn.science/codex/thargoids/)).
