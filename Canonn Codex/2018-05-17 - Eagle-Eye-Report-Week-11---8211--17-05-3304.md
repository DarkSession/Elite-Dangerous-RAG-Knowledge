Eagle Eye Report and Summary of the previous week:

For a second time both target systems were successfully defended with LTT 8517 and Dalfur systems both having the Thargoid threat repelled. Well done all who took to their ships in support. Neither system are showing non-human signal sources at present.

Intelligence obtained from Eagle Eye this week shows the targets are Lalande 4141 and Lwalama, and NHSS have been detected. 

Aegis Megaships were dispatched to Coquim and LHS 1453 (neither of which were Eagle Eye targets) and wrecked megaships were found in several systems nearby. 

The other targets given to us by EE were decoded and have indicated a barnacle forest location, wrecked megaships, and an INRA base (Almeida in Conn).

All indications so far are that both Achenar and Sol are intended destinations.
