## Pand Unregistered Comms Beacon

Published: 19 Mar 2024 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/pand-unregistered-comms-beacon/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Pand system, orbiting body B 5. 

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be on the hour, every 4 hours, with transmissions reported at: 00:00 / 04:00 / 08:00 / 12:00 / 16:00 / 20:00. 

The transmitted message is the following:

> 
> 10 1 3 11 16 15 20
> (repeated four times)

Decodes by letter positions to:

> 
> JACKPOT

Unfortunately, the related Herald is missing, so we are unable to find and confirm the target location.

A “Pirate Trap” POI can be found in the nearby Col 285 Sector ZQ-C c13-12 system, orbiting the Main Star. The “Pirate Trap” contains wreckage and hostile ships, who will initiate an attack without comms.

Given the proximity to the Pand system, this may well be the correct target for this Unregistered Comms Beacon. However, without the corresponding Herald to decode, this is impossible to confirm.
