## Bellmarsh-class Reformatory

Published: 14 Oct 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/bellmarsh-class-prison-ship/)

Content: The Bellmarsh-class is a class of Prison Ship.

The class consists of a very large central seven-engine drive structure, flanked by two detention centers, and topped by a command module that faces perpendicular to the apparent front of the ship. Both detention center modules have one Turret in direction of travel.

The front of the drive structure is protected by an interstellar dust shield. The front of the detention centers have modules similar to those seen on science ships. Two of three Cargo Bays can be found here.

The Ship Log Uplink is generally mounted on the top of the central drive structure, immediately in front of the command module, as well as a third Cargo Bay and a third Turret. Rearwards of the command module is a Hackable Comms Array.

Its default Cargo of around 500 tons is Legal Drugs, Personal Effects, Textiles and Weapons.
