Subject: Eagle Eye Report Week 8 - 26/04/3304

Eagle Eye Report as follows:
HIP 17692 - Decodes as Alnath (INRA Installation Located Here) & SPOCS 253 - Sturckow Port 
HR 1185 - Decodes as HIP 15329 (INRA Installation Located Here) & Trocnades - Franklin Hub.

Trocnades has no NHSS currently however SPOCS 253 does. Surveillance will continue. Scans of nearby systems around LP 581-36 have shown to us that NHSS are present in a system not named by EE. Deneb Algedi has NHSS (all types). We believe the next wave of attacks will come in SPOCS 253 and Deneb Algedi.

Attempts at communication still failing.
