## Debris Field

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/debris-field/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Sanuma system, orbiting body 1 d. 

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be on the hour, every 4 hours, with transmissions reported at: 00:00 / 04:00 / 08:00 / 12:00 / 16:00 / 20:00. 

The transmitted message is the following:

> 
> 14 15 23 9 3 18 25
> (repeated four times)

Decodes by letter positions to:

> 
> NOWICRY

This message is the decryption key for an encoded Galnet article in the local Herald:

The message consists of a series of words that can be interpreted as the NATO phonetic alphabet, yielding the message:

> 
> UHAWRH-VNFKHVVNFKK-UNDSMFHXKGHFJ-HIKQVEQWUVKF3

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of NOWICRY taken from the beacon yielded the message:

> 
> SANUMA-THREATTHREE-SHIPGRAVEYARD-ABELTCLUSTER3

This leads to a “Debris Field” signal source in the Sanuma system, in A Belt – Cluster 3. The signal source contains a large amount of ship wreckage and a small number of Engineer Materials.
