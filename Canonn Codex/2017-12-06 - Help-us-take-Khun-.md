## Help us take Khun!

Published: 06 Dec 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/news/help-us-take-khun/)

Content: A few months ago we sneaked into engineer Elvira Martuuks’s home system Khun, and after a long year of planning war has finally broken out there.

Now help us and fight alongside Canonn commanders in conflict zones in Khun to make Canonn the first player backed minor faction to take an engineer’s system!

You can use the engineer base for repairs and restocking, with a High CZ about 16.4Mm away, and be sure to turn your combat bonds in at Gunn Laboratory in Khun (which has large pads but no repair facility).

For Doctor Arcanonn!
