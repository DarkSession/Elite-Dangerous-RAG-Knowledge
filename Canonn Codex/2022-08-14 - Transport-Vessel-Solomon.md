## Log

There is one Settlement update link giving the backstory of the crash.

It was originally [discovered over three years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/easxoq/found_a_crashed_transport_ship_the_solomon/ "https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/easxoq/found_a_crashed_transport_ship_the_solomon/") but mistakenly assumed to be a known site in a different system. It was rediscovered and correctly reported by Commander Disgo two years later.

> **REMEMBER WHERE WE PARKED**.
> Okay everyone remember where we parked.
> 
> Parked, is that what you called that. I call that crashing! You almost killed us, you idiot! When we get back to command I’m going to make sure you never fly again!
> 
> What are you so angry about? You wanted to get down to the planet surface quickly. I remember you saying that it had to be quickly. So I miscalculated the gravitational effects on entry, I did get you here quickly. What’s the problem?
> 
> The problem?! THE PROBLEM?! The program is you’ve marooned us on this rock you moron. The ship is totalled. What was your brilliant plan to get us out of here? Should we all start flapping our arms and hope we learn how to fly?!
> 
> Relax, sheesh. I’ve called for help. By the time you do whatever it is you wanted to do down here, backup will have arrived. Trust me.
