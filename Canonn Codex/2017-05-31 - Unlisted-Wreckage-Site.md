## Logs

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground, and within the site there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

The site appears to be ship wreckage formed into a makeshift settlement, and augmented with additional building components and acting as a cargo storage location.

Around the site there are five Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

> …Secure Channel Established…
> 
> This is Lieutenant Stott, I’m in.
> 
>  The gang bought the back story hook, line and sinker. Once I have their confidence, I should be able to find out who’s funding these clowns.

> **THE INSIDE MAN 2/5**
> …Secure Channel Established…
> 
> This goes deeper than we thought.
> 
> This is no petty gang of pirates, these guys are highly organised. The gang leaders are a tight group and keep everything on a need to know basis, but I think I’ve found my way in.

> 
> **THE INSIDE MAN 3/5**
> …Secure Channel Established…
> 
> I was right, we’ve uncovered a major crime ring here. Guns, drugs, bootleg liquor, slaves, protection rackets.
> 
> These guys have their fingers in every criminal activity in the sector. My plan to gain access to the leadership is a go. I’ve just shown the boss evidence that one of his trusted lieutenants is leaking information to the local security services.

> **THE INSIDE MAN 4/5**
> …Secure Channel Established…
> 
> I know what they’re saying about me.
> 
> I’ve switched sides, I’m a traitor. It’s not true. What I’ve done I had to do to maintain my cover. And it’s got me results.
> 
> I’ve stashed a data packet on a derelict ship on Belu B 1. Lat -40, Long 7.15. It contains a full manifest for the gangs next big deal. The boss is going to be overseeing this one personally, it’s big and if we can catch them in the act, there’ll be no getting out of it.

> **THE INSIDE MAN 5/5**
> …Secure Channel Established…
> 
> Stott… Stott… Get out, abort, abort.
> 
> Operation has been compromised. They know about you. We found a leak in Command, they’ve been working with the gang all this time.
> 
> Get out now.

The logs give the details of the location of a [Crashed Ship](https://canonn.science/codex/belu-crashed-ship/) on Belu B 1, though it should be noted that the latitude and longitude are the incorrect way around and should be reversed.
