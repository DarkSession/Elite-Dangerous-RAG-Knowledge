Content: Cmdr Djtarjan reports on the [Threadnought](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/alien-archeology-and-other-mysteries-thread-9-the-canonn.300054/page-1574#post-5507487) of discovering a Distress Call Threat 0 around *Epsilon Arietis* area (screenshots show *32 Nu Arietis*) observing an *Unknown Ship* leaving the area and a damaged Corvette registration number FVU-85 as well as a Black Box. This is the first reported outside the immediate area of Maia.
Note: This Distress Call no longer appears to be present, in neither the 32 Nu Arietis system nor the Epsilon Arietis system – 20 Sep 3310.

Note: The images show that the 32 Nu Arietis system is 24.7 Ly’s away, this indicates that the images were taken in the Epsilon Arietis system, as it is the only system at that distance from 32 Nu Arietis
