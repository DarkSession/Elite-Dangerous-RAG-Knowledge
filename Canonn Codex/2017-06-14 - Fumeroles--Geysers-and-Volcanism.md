## Fumeroles, Geysers and Volcanism

Content: ### Fumeroles

A fumarole is typically an opening in a planet’s crust allowing gases and dissolved minerals from deep below the surface to be ejected into the surroundings or deposited around the sides of the openings of the fumarole structures. 

Fumaroles appear in chaotic or patchy clusters as the placement of these is determined ultimately by what’s heating them underground.

### Geysers

A geyser is characterised by the way they eject materials under enormous pressure and with great violence. Usually geysers are located nearby volcanic areas but in space this is not always the case. Geysers in space or Cryo-geysers (in some areas) are viable due to the low ambient pressures and solar heating.

### Volcanism

Materials can be deposited on the openings of these vents.

The types of geyser/fumarole discovered include the follow. Volcanism type is listed in the body details once scanned:

- Silicate Vapour
- Carbon Dioxide
- Water
- Water Vapour
- Silicate Magma
- Iron Magma
- Ammonia Magma

###### Deposited Materials

Materials can build up over time on the openings of geysers and fumaroles alike. These materials are determined by the composition of the planet which can be discovered by performing a detailed surface scan.

There are a few types of structures which you can collect to yield materials. These will appear on your sensors as one of the following:

- Piceous Cobble (G1 & G2 Elements)
- Crystalline Fragments (G3 Elements)
- Crystalline Cluster (G3 & G4 Elements)
- Needle Crystals (G4 Elements)

There are no G5 Raw materials, so none are available. It is to be noted that the materials which drop are the ones listed on the planet’s details in the system map.
