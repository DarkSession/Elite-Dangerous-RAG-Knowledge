## Generation Ships

Published: 26 Sep 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/generation-ships/)

Content: Generation Ships are a particular class of [Megaship](https://canonn.science/codex/megaships/), launched in the days before true FTL travel. They traversed the space between the stars at subluminal speeds, while their inhabitants were born, lived, procreated, and died onboard.

Multiple generations of crew would be born before the ship finally reached its destination.

While most Generation Ships arrived safely at their destination, and laid the seeds for the worlds we now know as The Bubble, some never reached their targets. Known collectively as “The Missing”, the stories behind these ships are both fascinating and disturbing.

Generation Ships appear on your Navigation Panel when your ship is within 1,000 Ls of them. Explorers are suggested to regularly check their Navigation Panel when traversing a system to perform surface scans, and report any strange signal sources, including Generation Ships.
