> **MAINTENANCE REPORT**
> Ok, ok, I’m on it. I’m just reworking the generator now. I’ll be back at base in a few hours.

> I don’t know why I should be out here doing all the work, when it’s those jerks at command that caused the problem.

> This whole system is a horrific hack job. I know we’re an exploration team, but whoever worked out the locations of the beacons really didn’t think about us poor wretches having to drive out to fix them every 3 days.
