## Surface Biology

Content: ## History

Surface biology can be found throughout the galaxy on landable planets. Initially pilots were only able to land on planets with no atmosphere and this limited the species that could be found on them. There were also no tools for locating the biology. Commanders had to resort to what was affectionately described as beige patrol.  Pilots would fly over the surface for hours on end looking for tiny specs on the surface that might be life.

The first biologicals to be found in 3302 were Bark Mounds, Anemones, Brain Trees and Thargoid Barnacles. Thargoid Barnacles strictly speaking aren’t considered to be true biologicals as they are considered to be biomechanical constructs of the Thargoids. 

Despite being aware of the existence of Sinuous Tubers from [found footage from a doomed expedition in 3303](https://canonn.science/codex/alien-tubeworms-hunt), no new species were found until 3304. The Pilots Federation supplied ship scanners that were able to identify the location of life on the surface of planets, making it much easier to find.

From then on, additional species were discovered, starting with the Sinuous Tubers and followed quickly by Amphora Plants and Crystalline Shards. 

Despite the technological advances, life remained relatively rare in the galaxy restricted to small areas around nebulae.

The biological specimens that could be found at this time are known as Horizons era biology.

In 3307 ships became capable of landing on planets with thin atmospheres. The Pilots Federation released new surface scanning technology that led to a huge increase in the volume and variety of life that could be found across every region of the Galaxy. This marks the beginning of the Odyssey era. 

Not only were the Odyssey era biological samples more abundant but they could also share biomes with multiple other species. At the time of writing the most species found on a single planet was 12 in Drojau BG-W d2-1 A 3 b.

Some Horizons Era species were also found to exist on atmospheric planets, but this was quite a rare occurrence.

In 3307 the Vista Genomics Company opened branches across the galaxy and started offering [lucrative rewards](https://canonn.science/codex/vista-genomics-price-list "Vista Genomic Price List") for samples scanned with the new Organic Scanner module supplied with the Artemis Environment suit. 

## Taxonomy

The names of the biological samples are constructed from the different taxonomic components, Family, Genus, Species and Variety.  For instance the Emerald variety in the species Upapam of the Genus Fonticulua in the Odyssey family is known as Fonticulua Upupam – Emerald.

#### Family

There are two families of Biology named after the eras in which they were found. Horizons and Odyssey

As previously noted there is a broad distinction between the Horizons family and the Odyssey family.  The Odyssey family of biology can only be found on landable planets with a thin atmosphere. The Horizons family can appear mainly on planets with no atmosphere and occasionally on planets with thin atmospheres . One other difference between the two is that only the Horizons family can sprout growths which can be harvested for materials. 

#### Genus

This is the principal taxonomic category that ranks above species and below family. Some of the Horizons family only have a genus and do not differentiate further into species and varieties.

#### Species

All of the Odyssey family can be split into distinct species. No two varieties of the same species can be found on the same planet.

#### Variety

The variety is a sub species. Often the varieties will be tied to a specific star class or a specific material in the composition of the planet.

They form a kaleidoscopic range of patterns and colours based on their method of metabolism. They derive energy from photosynthetic chemosynthetic or thermosynthetic processes. These are believed to be the precursors for many life forms, and are often found in conjunction with other species. Links between the biochemistry of bacterial colonies and neighbouring organisms are likely but as yet unproven.* |

The visible tips can be observed protruding from the ice, often near fissures where it is thinnest. The bulk of the organisms extend down through the ice into subsurface melt potentially for several kilometres. Electricae are superconductive in nature. utilising the thermal circulation of the surrounding fluid to drive an electrochemical process. This is probably why they are limited to planets with atmospheres dominated by noble gases. The surface structure exists to provide a connection to the atmosphere, which in turn creates a point of electrical potential difference. A by-product of this is the bioluminescent display that runs through the organism. Although never witnessed, reproduction presumably occurs below the surface by some unidentified process.* |

As the fonticulus develop they melt ice from around them, absorbing the liquid through tiny cellular pores and passing it to the colony’s reproductive edge. Here the liquid is excreted and immediately refreezes, creating hard translucent exoskeletons that provide protection for the organisms. Frond structures create a wide flat space that expose internal photosynthetic cells to as much light as possible. Reproduction appears to occur by colony division, most likely when a shard of the structure collapses under its own weight and the smaller shard creates a new colony.* |

They are photosynthetic organisms with specialised photoreceptors that work even in low light conditions. As such they are highly successful, and are widespread and diverse in nature. Their small leaf structures protect them against extremely low temperatures and liquid loss in higher temperatures.* |

Their metabolism is driven exclusively through chemosynthetic and thermosynthetic mechanisms based on nearby volcanic activity. Proximity to volcanic heat allows them to survive in environments where the ambient temperature is naturally too cold for them. They frequently incorporate minerals from the fumaroles’ ejecta, meaning they can appear inorganic at first glance and may sport exotic colours.* |

They share similar morphology to fungi but are not saprophytic, instead their mycelial body drives its metabolism through chemosynthetic and thermosynthetic processes. These are facilitated by the substrate which also protects the organism from environmental extremes. The exposed aspects of the organisms are primarily involved in reproduction. This is frequently through spore ejection, but certain species also support gaseous exchange with the atmosphere. Some fungoicla exhibit bioluminescent behaviours as part of a metabolic process involved in the breakdown of accumulated toxins.* |

They are defined by a symbiotic relationship that has evolved between two unicellular organisms. which are now inseparable. One cell type is solely responsible for energy production by either photosynthetic. chemosynthetic or thermosynthetic processes. The symbiotic cells harvest some of this energy, and in turn deposit a hard rock-like substance extracted from the local geology to create a rigid endoskeleton. This structure provides a solid base for the organism to exist. It features complex folds that help increase available surface area for metabolic interactions. Osseus have been observed to create callus-like cell coverings, and withdraw themselves into the endoskeleton for protection.* |

Using a combination of inorganic and hydrocarbon materials, they build a shielding bubble. This allows them to create an isolated biome with regulated temperature and chemical composition. Growth is a difﬁcult and complex process that requires careful melting, regrowing and freezing of the external shell so that the internal organism can develop. This is a gradual process meaning that larger recepta are of significant age. Reproduction is also similarly complex and revolves around a budding process, which creates a smaller version of the adult. Once detached, it can roll under the action of gravity and air currents before coming to rest, where it will deploy a holdfast marking its final position.* |

The body of the organism may be embedded in the rock subsurface to provide protection from the elements, leaving the tough photosynthetic proto-leaves exposed. Their simple proto-evolutionary nature means that they are a common sight on rocky worlds. Colouration is driven by a mixture of the mineral content of the attached rock and the absorption spectral of the nearby stellar body.* |

The organisms’ height and ability to survive is largely constrained by gravity. The lack of any real atmospheric weather has not put evolutionaly pressure on the towers to be strong, so they form tall but thin structures which cannot be supported in high-gravity environments. The tower is formed from wrapped leaf-like structures, which create a regulated chimney void. This is used by the organism to create and maintain an artificial internal atmosphere, where discrete chemical processes can be undertaken along the length of the tower. Waste gases and other material may he released from the top of the tower. Some species feature external rings that can be used to gauge an organism’s age.* |

They have a shallow but complex root structure, which requires a solid surface to produce structural stability. Clumps may form through tillering or wider dispersal through a variety of seeding mechanisms. Some species have adapted cellular structures containing high sugar concentrations to protect against freezing damage.* |
