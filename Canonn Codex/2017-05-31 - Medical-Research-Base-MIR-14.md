Alert messages were previously audible at the settlement, however that no longer seem to be the case. The messages included:

> 
> Unknown Contaminant Detected. Please clear the area.

> 
> This site has been designated a no-go area. Do not attempt to approach this facility.

## Logs

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground, and next to the entrance of the settlement there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

Around the settlement there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

> 
> **CANNOT GET OUT 1/4**
> When we first ran tests on the compound we thought it could be used as a mood inhibitor to help tackle anxiety and other mental afflictions. Early results were very promising. But we were so wrong.

> 
> **CANNOT GET OUT 2/4**
> Some of the test subjects had a very different reaction to the treatment. It seemed to heighten their aggressive tendencies, some manifesting this in self harm or vocal outbursts. But in a small percentages it turned them into monsters, capable of the most horrific violence.

> 
> **CANNOT GET OUT 3/4**
> When the company found out they marketed it as a success, selling the research to the military. Under military control we were forced to keep working on this new programme. To create a serum that could be given to soldiers and other military personnel to make them into better killing machines.
> 
> Those of us that refused were “reassigned” as our new masters put it. We knew what that meant. Gods help me I wasn’t strong enough to be one of them.

> 
> **CANNOT GET OUT 4/4**
> I can’t go on with this mockery of science. I wanted to help people, not turn human beings into rabid killing machines.
> 
> This is my confession and a warning to others. The military will stop at nothing to get an edge over their enemies. Even if that means destroying thousands of lives in the process.
> 
> Tonight I released the test subjects into the settlement. I’m not asking for forgiveness. I knew what that would mean. Everyone… dead… or worse. I can hear them hunting for me, but it’s too late. It’s all coming down.
> 
> I can’t afford to let anything from this place get out into the hands of any power. I’ve destroyed all the data I can find and my final act will be to vent the settlement, open it up to space. That should kill everyone one left alive in here. This cannot get out. This cannot get out.
