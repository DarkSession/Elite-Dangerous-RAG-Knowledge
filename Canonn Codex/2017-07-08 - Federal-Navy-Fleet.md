## Federal Navy Fleet

Published: 08 Jul 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/federal-navy-fleet/)

Content: The Federal Navy maintains a number of their vessels on permanent patrol stations, in addition to their active fleet that can be found in Conflict Zones.

These ships may occasionally be accompanied by additional Federal Navy vessels who will open fire on you if you stray too close to them or the Capital Ship. When no additional vessels are around, the Capital Ship is safe to approach.

**Note: since the [Federation’s withdrawal from the Pleiades on 07 OCT 3303](https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/59d7526d8101dd5da464f2fa), many of these assigned patrol stations have likely changed.**

- Achansa 2 – Lunan Terminal
- [Airsetanoa 2](https://canonn.science/codex/airsetanoa-military-installation/) (Military Installation)
- Antobri A 1 – Treshchov Dock
- Guaras B 1 – Klimuk Ring
- Halai A 1 – Chaudhary Enterprise
- Limapa 1 – Kovalyonok Port
- Neits C 2 – Still Hangar
- Parutis 2 – Evans Port
- Rhea 4 – Balandin Gateway
- Zoqui Xuang A 3 – Hoften Enterprise

These dock facilities contain a single Farragut-class Battlecruiser, showing signs of battle damage, undergoing repairs. The ships are never not broadcasting a transponder signal, and do not carry any identifying hull markings, so cannot be identified.

One or more Satellites can be found in the immediate area, giving Engineer Data when scanned.
