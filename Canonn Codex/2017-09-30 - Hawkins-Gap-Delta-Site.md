Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Plaa Aec RY-B b41-1 system, orbiting body A.

The transmission times of this beacon are on the hour, every hour.

The transmitted message is the following:

* * *

> 
> DYJEPQY UWLUDCQCKJ XUEOKJ
> DJPQY P6 UNL001
> NEHHY LKCJQ 2X
> BEVGCJP AEL
> LHEE EUO NYX X41 1
> IKDUPQEJDXY
> (repeated two times)

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of EXODUS yields the message:

> 
> DYNASTY EXPEDITION BEACON
> DNSTY S6 ERP001
> RALLY POINT 2B
> HAWKINS GAP
> PLAA AEC RYB B41 1
> MODESTANDBY

An abandoned settlement can be found within the same system on body 2 b, at 16.8716, -157.9496 (in Live/4.0) or at 51.0059, -155.0895 (in Legacy/3.8).

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground.

Around the settlement there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

> “This is a bigger operation than I thought it was. A massive fleet of Anacondas all prepped for long endurance travel out to the edge of beyond. No ships have markings, no emblems, no political affiliation. Somebody with deep pockets must be paying for this, but who ?”

> “Judging by the way the fleet deployed I would say there were three main destinations, all a long way outside of the core worlds. We got our orders today, we’re making for a zone called “Hawkin’s Gap”. It’s a seriously long way, not even the explorers have been out this way before. Strange mission.”
