Published: 19 Sep 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/airsetanoa-military-installation/)

Content: A Federation capital ship dock facility is in orbit above the independent planet Airsetanoa 2.

It contains one or more Farragut-class Battlecruisers, showing signs of battle damage, undergoing repairs. The ships are not broadcasting a transponder signal, and do not carry any identifying hull markings, so cannot be identified.

Not of any known scientific interest.
