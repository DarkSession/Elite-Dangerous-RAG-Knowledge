## Megaships

Published: 26 Sep 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/megaships/)

Content: Megaships are truly massive space-going vessels, often rivaling space stations in size, and can be found both within and outside of the bubble.

They can be divided into three broad categories: [Generation Ships](https://canonn.science/codex/generation-ships/), which are separately listed; Flight Operations Carriers, which you can dock at; and Bulk Cruisers which you cannot. Bulk Cruiser mega ships can be identified by their class, of which there are often many examples. Known classes are:

Bulk Cruisers are generally identified by a unique designation, such as CRV-900; but a select few are specially named instead. Both Generation Ships and Flight Operations Carriers are named.

While some megaships remain in one place at all times, most move between systems on a weekly basis following a Flight Operations Plan. For an overview of where the expected locations of these ships are, see [Megaship Flight Operations](https://canonn.science/codex/megaship-flight-operations/).

Megaships appear on your Navigation Panel when your ship is within 1,000 Ls of them. Explorers are suggested to regularly check their Navigation Panel when traversing a system to perform surface scans, and report any strange signal sources, including Megaships.
