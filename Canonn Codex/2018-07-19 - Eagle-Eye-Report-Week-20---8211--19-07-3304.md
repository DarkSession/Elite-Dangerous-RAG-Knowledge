Unfortunately HIP 44811 (Metcalf Station) was attacked as predicted possibly due to the fact it is a system with little to no traffic. We must re double our efforts.

We have again 2 targets this week of Thargoid interest. Di Jian system (Preuss Terminal) and RMK 6 system (Zudov Hub).

Curiously, the Jiman system was a target of interest for the Thargoids, however when a Thargoid Link was taken to the system and had its octal coding played back at it, it just sat there with its directional laser, spinning. Is this a faulty link or are the Thargoids becoming lax possibly? Further testing is required.
