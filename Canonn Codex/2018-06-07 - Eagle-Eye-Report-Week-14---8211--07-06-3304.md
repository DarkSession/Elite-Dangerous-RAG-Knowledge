Eagle Eye Report and Summary of the previous week:

Now for the fifth time in a row both target systems were successfully defended - with HIP 21559 and LP 581-36 systems both having the Thargoid threat repelled. Once again, this is a huge achievement by the commanders ho took to their ships in support, the residents of these systems have a lot to thank you for.

Intelligence obtained from Eagle Eye this week shows the targets are Kung Mu (Foda Port) and Nauni (Beaufoy Vision), and NHSS have been detected by CMDRs at the scene in both systems.

The Aegis Megaships have been moved to Mezavini (The Acropolis) and Socho (Vanguard), and according to Eagle Eye 1 the Eagle Eye 2 Installation in HR 1185 is being targeted for attack by Thargoids next week along with both Aegis Megaships. Having seen the Eagle Eye 3 Installation targeted last week but still remaining unscathed we are uncertain what to make of this.  

It should be noted that Beaufoy Vision in Nauni was attacked by Thargoids back in February and is still currently under repair operations, with refugees seeking to flee the system. Surely the Thargoids could not be so cowardly as to kick a station while it's still on it's knees, though I can't help but express that the huge population in Kung Mu (600 million) has me concerned for a potentially massive loss of life there.
