Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Novas system, orbiting body A 6. 

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be every hour, on the hour.

The transmitted message is the following:

> 
> 05 11 33 02 1605
> 9 18 5 22 15 12 20
> (repeated four times)

However, the Unregistered Comms Beacon previously known to transmit the following, at 05 minutes past every hour:

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of IREVOLT to the remainder of the message yielded:

> 
> PROJECTPESTCONTOL
> CG
> ELLI
> WRIGHTCITY
> DELIVER
> TOXANDJIVIROCIDE
> THEYWILLPAYFORWFATTHEYDID

An appeal matching the description in the message was issued at the named station:

> 
> **Earn rewards by delivering Toxandji Virocide to Wright City in the Elli system.**
> 
> A mysterious organisation known as Revolution Incorporated has issued an appeal for Toxandji Virocide, a rare pesticide.
> 
> The chemical is commonly used in industrial-scale agriculture, and can be ‘programmed’ to target specific parasites.
> 
> The reason for the request is not clear, but Revolution Incorporated has promised to generously rewards those who deliver the requested commodity to Wright City in the Elli system.

This appeal began on 5 Nov 3302.

Due to the cryptic nature of the signals leading to the appeal, and possible connections of virocide with the rumors of a mycoid virus having been used against the Thargoid race, a number of Canonn scientists and agents chose to take part.

The appeal was successfully completed, but rather than leading to a scientific breakthrough, it instead resulted in a terrorist attack on the star port:

> 
> **Galactic News: Anarchist Organisation Closes Starport**
> 10 Nov 3302
> 
> Recent reports indicate that Wright City in the Elli system has fallen prey to a chemical-weapon attack.
> 
> The attack is believed to have been executed by the anarchist organisation Revolution Incorporated, which recently placed orders for a quantity of Toxandji Virocide, a rare pesticide. It is understood the group used the pesticide as the basis for a potent chemical weapon.
> 
> The impact on the starport has been catastrophic. Over a dozen individuals have lost their lives, and hundreds more are in critical condition. As a result, the starport has been closed until further notice.
> 
> System security forces have already started hunting for Revolution Incorporated, but with little physical evidence and few leads, the chances of bringing the culprits to justice are slim.
