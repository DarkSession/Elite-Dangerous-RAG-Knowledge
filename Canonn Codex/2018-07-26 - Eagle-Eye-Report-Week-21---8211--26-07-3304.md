 Subject: Eagle Eye Report Week 21 - 26/07/3304

Unfortunately this week, both Preuss Terminal (Di Jian System) and Zudov Hub (RMK 6 System) were both attacked. Rescue operations have begun in both systems as of 16:30 VST (Varati Standard Time).

Eagle Eye has revealed to us this week that the Thargoids are interested in a few systems. The targeted stations should be given priority. Those are Plucker Enterprise (Dhanhopi System - 199ls) and Landsteiner Orbital (Bok System - 931ls).

A full record of Eagle Eye transmissions can be found in the Canonn archives.

The AEGIS megaships are currently in Triton (223ls from starfall) and Gree (6ls from starfall)
