Content: The [Alcatraz Class Prison Ship](https://canonn.science/codex/alcatraz-class-prison-ship/) designation JJF-048 was last reported in orbit of the planet HIP 17692 A 3.

The ship is heavily damaged, destroyed by weapons consistent with other Thargoid attacks, leaving green hull scarring and some kind of green gas throughout the area.

A Ship Log Uplink point can be located on the hull. Deploy your ship’s hardpoints and use the onboard Data Link Scanner within 200m of the post to scan it and retrieve the log:

> Until it’s confirmed hostile, do not do anything that it could see as a threat. I repeat – Do not engage! If we don’t provoke it, maybe it will just pass us by.

A Thargoid Ship may still be in the area; if not, Medical and Emergency Aid ships will be present, rescuing the survivors.

A number of Engineer Materials and Cargo Canisters are scattered nearby.
