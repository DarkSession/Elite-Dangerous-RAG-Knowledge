Published: 24 Oct 2020 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/lhs-2429-crashed-ship/)

Content: A crashed Type 9 on LHS 2429 1 at -14.17, 131.13 (use the Detailed Surface Scan to reveal it as CRASHED SHIP, though it doesnâ€™t always appear straight after a scan). There is a cargo rack giving raw materials and most notably this crash is a source of legal Hafnium 178 (there are two tons scattered at the site). There is also a ship core that can be scanned for a data package.
