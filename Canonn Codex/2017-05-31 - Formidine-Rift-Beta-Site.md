## Formidine Rift Beta Site

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/formidine-rift-beta-site/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Eafots LZ-H b10-0 system, orbiting body D. 

The transmission times of this beacon are on the hour, every hour.

The transmitted message is the following:

* * *

> 
> DYJEPQY UWLUDCQCKJ XUEOKJ
> DJPQY P6 UNL003
> NEHHY LKCJQ D1
> SKNICDCJUNCSQ
> UESKQP CZB X10 0
> IKDUPQEJDXY
> (repeated two times)

 Note: There are two separate UCB’s approximately 30km’s apart, both UCB’s transmit the same message at the same transmission times.

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of EXODUS yields the message:

> 
> DYNASTY EXPEDITION BEACON
> DNSTY S6 ERP003
> RALLY POINT D1
> FORMIDINERIFT
> EAFOTS IZH B10 0
> MODESTANDBY

The system name in the beacon appears to be an error and should be interpreted as LZ-H rather than the IZ-H given, since it’s the system the beacon is in.

An abandoned settlement can be found within the same system on body D 1, at -23.0619, -174.8773 (in Live/4.0 and Legacy/3.8).

Within the settlement there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

Around the settlement there are six Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:
