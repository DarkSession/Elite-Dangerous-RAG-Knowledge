## Rhizome Pod

Published: 10 Sep 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/rhizome-pod/)

Content: There are several varieties of Rhizome Pod to be found around the galaxy – notably in the Tenebrae sector. They appear inside Notable Stellar Phenomena. They are the only Pod that the in-game codex states to have no known ‘Tree’ associated with it.  

In-game codex information shows that the different variants appear near different planet types, and have different requirements for Star Types – more can be found in the game codex.

Space lifeforms often have discoverable traits – scan them with the Composition Scanner when they are doing something to reveal the traits. For Rhizome Pods these are the traits:

- Moves towards other seeds / pods
- Retreats if approached

They can be sampled using Research Limpets and have returned Pod Core Tissue, Pod Dead Tissue, and Pod Surface Tissue.
