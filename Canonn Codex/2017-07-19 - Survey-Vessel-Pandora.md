## Survey Vessel Pandora

Published: 19 Jul 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/survey-vessel-pandora/)

Content: The Survey Vessel Pandora can be found in the HIP 21478 system, orbiting body A 1 f.

The existence of this vessel was hinted by the logs at [Relay Station PSJ-17](https://canonn.science/codex/relay-station-psj-17), and revealed by the nearby listening post:

> So far nothing to report, site is still secure, looks like their mission registration was for minable locations in planetary rings not planet side surveying.

### Logs

A series of four Ship Log Uplink points can be located along the hull, each yielding one half of two distinct logs. Deploy your ship’s hardpoints and use the onboard Data Link Scanner within 200m of each post to scan them and retrieve the logs. In addition to the text, each log is accompanied by an audio recording:

> **SURVEY VESSEL PANDORA, COMMUNICATIONS LOG 1/2:**
> This is the Survey Vessel Pandora, requesting update to mission parameters
> 
> We’ve detected an unidentified signal on the surface of a nearby planet. Request permission to investigate.
> 
> …Mission Critical Update…
> 
> Permission granted. Updating registration.

> l’ve put a mission update request in, but I’m not waiting to hear back before we take a look. For all we know, we could be sitting on something special here.

> Anyway, by the time we get there, we should have received the relevant permissions. No harm no foul.”

> **SURVEY VESSEL PANDORA, COMMANDER’S LOG 2/2:**
> This is interesting, our long range probes have pinpointed the source of the signal. It’s coming from what we suspect to be a a huge structure.

> The permissions have arrived, just one more day and we’ ll be in orbit and ready to go down.

The logs give the location of a [Thargoid Structure](https://canonn.science/codex/the-unknown-structure/) in the Col 285 Sector CV-Y d57 system on body AB 4 a, at **-43.4843**, **71.4501** (in Live/4.0) or at 4.7657, 136.2391 (in Legacy/3.8).
