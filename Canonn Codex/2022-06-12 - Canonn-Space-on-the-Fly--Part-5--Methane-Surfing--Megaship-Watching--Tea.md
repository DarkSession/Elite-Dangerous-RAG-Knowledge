Content: **5.1 Hun Puggsa**

- *Industrial Outpost*
- *Megaships: WP 2*
- *Security Installation*

**5.1.1 Chandler Beacon: Industrial Outpost (A 2 – 16 ls)**

Chandler Beacon is an Industrial Outpost. You can find an entrance for loading on one of its sides. It’s almost a pure refinery, the only type of mineral sold is bertrandite.  Pick up some Silver.

- buy Silver

**5.1.2 WP 2: Megaships**

During Waypoint 2 there is a [Thomas-class Hauler](https://canonn.science/codex/thomas-class-bulk-cargo-ship/)in system to visit.

**5.1.3 Wallace Mobile Defence Group: Security Installation (A 7 – 2188 ls)**

Hun Puggsa has a rather rare type of Installation: a Security Installation at Hun Puggsa A 7.

**5.2.1 Col 285 Sector IX-T d3-81 4 a: Minor Methane Magma (4 a – 2290,02 ls)**

We are going for [another more rare type of volcanism](https://canonn.science/codex/statistical-properties-of-landable-volcanic-bodies/). If you are lucky, you can do Geyser Surfing between coloured smoke.

- jump 15,1 ly to Kumata

**5.3. Kumata**

- *Megaships: WP 1, 3, 5*
- *Civillian Installation*
- *Scientific Installation*

For a long time Kumata was the only Canonn-controlled High Security system. It is also a place you can trade profitably between all three orbital stations. We are here for the Civilian Installation Red Mare around Body 7 and the Scientific Installation Modern Energy Laboratories around Body 12 –  after visiting the Megaships.

**5.3.1: WP 1, 3, 5: Megaships**

During Waypoint 1 there is a Hogan-class Hauler to visit, during waypoint 3 and 5 a Samson-class Hauler.

**5.3.2: Red Mare: Civilian Installation (7 – 428 ls)**

The [Civilian Installation](https://canonn.science/tag/civilian-installation/)Red Mare is around body 7.

**5.3.3: Modern Energy Laboratories: Scientific Installation (12 – 1937 ls)**

The [Scientific Installation](https://canonn.science/tag/scientific-installation/)Modern Energy Laboratories is around body 12.

**5.4. Wikmeang**

- *Ocellus Starport*
- *Megaships: all Waypoints*

**5.4.1 Coleman Gateway: Ocellus Starport (A1 – 14,35 ls)**

Coleman Gateway is an Ocellus Starport – named for the eyeball-like main structure. On its backside you can see the housings for thrusters, which some Ocellus Ports still have if moved to their position a short time ago. Sell your silver, and fill your hold with Personal Weapons or Marine Equipment.

- sell Silver
- buy Personal Weapons or Marine Equipment

**5.4.2 Megaships**

Wikmeang is a hotspot for Megaship-watching. There is no Waypoint where there is not at least one megaship in system, and some have 4. Sometimes there are more than one of a type in system. Visit all different types present.

- visit all different types of Megaships present

- *Megaships: WP 1, 2 + 5*
- *Orbis Starport*
- *Economy: Agriculture*
- *Huge Population*

**5.5.1 WP 1, 2 +5: Megaships**

During Waypoint 1 there is a [Lichfield-class Reformatory](https://canonn.science/codex/lichfield-class-reformatory/)and a [Freedom-class Surveyor](https://canonn.science/codex/freedom-class-surveyor/)in system to visit. During Waypoint 2 a Freedom-class Surveyor. And during Waypoint 5 an [Alcatraz-class Reformatory](https://canonn.science/codex/alcatraz-class-prison-ship/).

**5.5.2 Meikle Dock: Orbis Starport (A 3 – 833 ls)**

**5.5.3 Economy: Agriculture**

**5.5.4 Huge Poulation**

HR 8133 is Canonns largest Population system, and Meikle Dock is Canonns only orbital Agriculture Station. It’s also the only Canonn-controlled system with Orbis Starports.

Inside Meikle Docks rotating Ring you can see a landscape of Parks and such. Matching the rotational movement of the habitat with flight-assist off is a great way to hone your piloting skills. Wherever you sip tea in Canonn Space, and it is tea and not made from spurious minerals, it is likely that it comes from Meikle Dock. 

We’ll sell the Aquaponic Systems here, they will be put to use on the waterworld Meikle Dock is orbiting. And load up with Mineral Oil.
