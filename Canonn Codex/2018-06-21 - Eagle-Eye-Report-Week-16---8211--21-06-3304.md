Eagle Eye Report and Summary of the previous week:

As of this morning, Hennepin Prospect located in the Assinda system was attacked by the Thargoids. We had a very good run in defense of the systems in previous weeks but now it seems to have come to a head.

All Eagle Eye installations are now transmitting the same message.
Message Reads:

no new signal detected thargoid activity unknown initiate protocol xeno 55.

What this means we don't know as of the moment and AEGIS are being quiet about what this means.

Lab69 will continue to survey and cache data for public consumption.
