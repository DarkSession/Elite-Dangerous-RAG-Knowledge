## Gyre Trees and Gyre Pods

Published: 09 Sep 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/gyre-trees-and-gyre-pods/)

Content: There are several varieties of Gyre Trees and their associated pods to be found around the galaxy – notably in the Xibalba and Kepler’s Crest sectors. They appear inside Notable Stellar Phenomena. Look for the largest concentration of signals inside the phenomena and you should find them. 

In-game codex information shows that the different variants appear near different planet types, and have different requirements for Star Types – more can be found in the game codex.

Space lifeforms often have discoverable traits – scan them with the Composition Scanner when they are doing something to reveal the traits. For Gyre Pods these are the traits:

- Releases spores if approached. These have a caustic effect.

Pods can be sampled using Research Limpets and can return one of Pod shell tissue, pod outer tissue, or pod mesoglea.
