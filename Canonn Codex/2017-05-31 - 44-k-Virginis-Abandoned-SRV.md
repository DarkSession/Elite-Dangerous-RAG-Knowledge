## Log

The moon on which the SRV is found is over 405,000 Ls from the arrival point. Since the SRV is so small, it’s very easy to miss.

There are Engineer Materials on the ground behind the SRV.

Within the SRV is an SRV Comms Log Uplink, scanning it gives background on what happened here:

> Hi, Dom. l bet you’re wondering what happened to the ship and why it’s not coming back. I wish I could tell you it wasn’t me, but that would be a lie… just like the ones you’ve been feeding me for the past two years. Enjoy the rest of your life on that dead rock you cheating snake.
