## Hesperus

Published: 11 Apr 2021 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/hesperus/)

Content: The Hesperus is a Lowell class megaship that can be found in the Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system, orbiting body B (A Belt – Cluster 1).

The Hesperus was owned by Azimuth Biochemicals, and it is the sister ship of the [Adamastor](https://canonn.science/codex/ghost-ship-adamastor/ "Ghost Ship Adamastor"). A dredger from the Scriveners Clan which was claiming to own to salvage rights on the Hesperus [left on 09 July 3307](https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/60e857529a9f437bd96dff0f "https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/60e857529a9f437bd96dff0f").  

There are low level materials and cargo scattered around. There is one uplink on the Hesperus and a Tourist Beacon that gives information that was previously available in an encoded form on the dredger. 

The survivors from the Azimuth Biochemicals crew were later found at the [Proteus](https://canonn.science/codex/proteus/ "Proteus") landing site. If you plan to head over there after the Hesperus you may find you cannot plot a direct route due to permit locked regions – navigating via the Oochorrs HZ-V b48-0 system, and the on to the Proteus should allow access.

The Hesperus was previously not visible in the FSS, you needed to drop into the actual asteroid cluster, however this is now not the case.

## Finding the Hesperus

### Galnet Announcement

On April 8 3307 [it was announced on Galnet](https://community.elitedangerous.com/galnet/uid/606eeff88e6ba571393b9fc5) that a Listening Post had been found on board the Adamastor with a cryptic message, referencing the Hesperus. As you drop into the Adamastor a message was received from someone signed as ‘Salvation’ indicating that the Listening Post contains  further search details:

> 
> **ACCESS CODES**
> Pilot, this message is being sent due to your proximity to Adamastor. I need your help to find out more about the signal it has received.
> 
> For now I cannot provide you with my credentials. Suffice to say that I am a man of science, unconnected with modern politics. I am recruiting agents to investigate the work undertaken by Azimuth Biochemicals two hundred years ago, which I believe to be of enormous scientific importance. Much has been lost in that time, but our dedication will allow us to rewrite history. 
> 
> The immediate goal is to locate the source of the signal. You can download this by scanning the listening post that is contained onboard the Adamastor. I am unable to travel to the Chukchan system, so you must obtain this yourself.
> 
> I have transmitted a unique access key to your ship’s computer, to allow you to read the signal’s contents. I believe it contains location data that has been rerouted through communication beacons. Unfortunately all details of these beacons have been lost, so your task is to find and decrypt them.
> 
> I shall be monitoring your progress remotely. Good luck.
> 
> Salvation

Scanning the Listening Post (only visible in the navigation panel once you drop at the Adamastor at Chukchan 5 b) gives further details:

> 
> PRIVATE BEACON
> Access Code AZB3648-000
> Secure channel link established.

> Proximity alert: Type G [unidentified megaship] 
> Emergency upload protocol 01G engaged.

Note: The Listening Post was subsequently removed, and this version of the message is no longer available. However, a decrypted version is available from the local news.

## Listening Posts

With the above clue to search in the Taurus region a listening post was found in Taurus Dark Region UY-R b4-0:

### Taurus Dark Region UY-R b4-0 B ( A Belt – Cluster 5 )

> 
> **PRIVATE BEACON**
> Transmitting encrypted data package
> 
> Weak matched signals detected:
> Latin alphabet
> H2 FBJILYIFUILOMPDYAFRGMKIULIN 1333
> H3 ADFFGDKIOOPLFNIHLRFEUOPQJWLSEDM
> 
> Source ID: H002255 [Hesperus] 
> Signal range: REDACTED
> 
> A3:-L\_,C3:+AF\_,G2:\*-A
> 
> …Transmission Ends..

Noting that the two lines H2 and H3 map to the lines in the original message also prefixed with H2 and H3 it was deduced that the information in the original message might help decode the new messages. -E / +H / -C were transformed (using A=1, B=2 etc) into -5 / +8 / -3 and used to determine that they are offsets in a [ROT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13 "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13") (rotation) cypher. So H2 (“+H”) becomes a ROT8 transform. When we do this to H2 we get “NJRQTGQNCQTWUXLGINZOUSQCTQV 1333”. If this is reformatted to also use ‘8’ as the width we get:

`NJRQTGQNCQTWUXLGINZOUSQCTQV 1333`

Reading down the right we get NGC 1333 as a clue. Applying the same logic to H3 we transform -C to -3. A rotation of -3 is the same as 23 – so ROT23 the text and lay out with a width of 3 and the result is California.

Searches of the area around NGC 1333 and the California Sector detected two more Listening Posts, one in the Perseus Dark Region LN-K b8-0 system (the NGC 1333 nebula is within the Perseus constellation), and the other in the California Sector IH-V c2-1 system. The California Listening Post was not found for some time – it is believed it was within an asteroid belt and not visible to the FSS (as is also the case with the Hesperus). All the Listening Posts are inside asteroid belts, which was presumably intended as a clue.

The California and Perseus Listening Posts repeat the existing H2/H3 data, and also give the H1 location – which can be decoded the same way to give the location TAURUS – which was the initial Listening Post. 

### Perseus Dark Region LN-K b8-0 A ( A Belt – Cluster 3 )

> Signal range: REDACTED
> 
> A2:/B,C1:BL\_,G1:+DF\_

### California Sector IH-V c2-1 A ( A Belt – Cluster 1 )

> 
> **PRIVATE BEACON**
> Transmitting encrypted data package

> Weak matched signals detected:
> Latin alphabet
> H1 ACGTYMNGYFUIPLZGHUIWBLUIZOPKMXGTR
> H2 FBJILYIFUILOMPDYAFRGMKIULIN 1333

> 
> A1:-AX\_,C2:\*-A,G3:+E\_
> 
> …Transmission Ends..

After all three were found we were left with three sets of data from the Listening Posts to decode.

## Decoding the Listening Post Messages

* * *

We have these codes from the three listening posts:

- A1:-AX\_,C2:\*-A,G3:+E\_
- A2:/B,C1:BL\_,G1:+DF\_
- A3:-L\_,C3:+AF\_,G2:\*-A

These were re-ordered to combine all the “A” sections in order, all the “C” sections in order, and all the “G” sections in order to give:

- A: -AX\_/B-L\_
- C: BL\_\*-A+AF\_
- G: +DF\_\*-A+E\_

And using Base26 encoding, along with replacing underscores with ‘0’ we get:

- A: -500/2-120
- C: 640\*-1+320
- G: 1100\*-1+50

And when we do the math we end up with:

- A: -370
- C: -320
- G: -1050

Looking at this location in the galmap gives the location of the Hesperus – Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 – as the closest result.

## Decoding the Dredger Logs

* * *

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dredger-1024x576.png)

The logs all use transposition encryption where the text is split into regular sized chunks and the characters are then swapped within each chunk, though the chosen chunk sizes differ. Some logs also reverse the data, and some specify characters that should be rendered as whitespace. A [python program](https://replit.com/@cosmodemonic/Elite-Dangerous-Hesperus-Logs-Decoder?v=1 "https://replit.com/@cosmodemonic/Elite-Dangerous-Hesperus-Logs-Decoder?v=1") has been written by Disgo to decode any of them. 

Decoded versions of the logs are now available from a beacon called “Hesperus Logs”, which was added after the logs were decoded.

### Log 1

The steps to decode are:

- the prefix (before —) specifies the re-ordering of the characters which will be used below
- split into 16 character chunks
- re-order the characters within each chunk in this order 16,3,2,8,7,11,5,4,13,12,6,10,9,15,14,1

### Log 2

The steps to decode are:

- the prefix (before —) specifies the re-ordering of the characters which will be used below
- split into 16 character chunks
- reorder the characters in each chunk in this order 6,3,2,8,13,1,9,4,7,12,16,10,5,15,14,11

### Logs 3 and 4

The steps to decode these messages are the same:

- The section at the start of the message encodes offsets into the message which should contain whitespace
- The prefix (-cdb) specifies the re-ordering of the characters which will be used below
- Reverse the rest of the message
- Split the message into 6 character chunks
- Reorder the characters in each chunk in this order 4,6,5,1,3,2
