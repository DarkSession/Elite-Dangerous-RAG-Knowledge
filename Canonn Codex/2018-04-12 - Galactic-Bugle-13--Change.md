## Galactic Bugle 13: Change

Published: 12 Apr 2018 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/news/galactic-bugle-13-change/)

Content: Welcome to the 13th Edition of the Galactic Bugle! This week I’ll be using this article to convey a list of the changes going into the Bugle, as well as a few recent happenings around the Human Bubble.

##### Changes to the Bugle

With a whole new rework, including a new logo made by CMDR Delmonte the Bugle will be reverting its name back to the original name of The Galactic Bugle! Along with the change the Bugle will be becoming more interactive with it’s audience! I’ll be reviving the weekly interesting places submissions and segment, along with accepting stories and personal reports from readers for the ability to publish their own stories in the Galactic Bugle! I look forward to seeing all the entries from now on!

##### How to Submit Fan Stories

Starting this week, I’m encouraging any pilots to send in their stories for a chance to be featured in the upcoming Bugle articles! Stories can range from reports, news, to even interesting personal journal entries. To any CMDR interested in submitting a story to be featured in the Bugle, please send your written story as you’d like it in the Bugle, alongside your CMDR name to me personally, and I will try my best to get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you in advance to everyone who submits a story to the Biscuit Bugle.

##### Anti-Thargoid Preparations

With the overwhelming support of a few recent requests sent to the Pilot’s Federation from a handful of Alliance factions scattered throughout the bubble, humanity have continued preparations of Thargoid Countermeasures, including a new Anti-Thargoid Military installation in HIP 33368 and a new Anti-Thargoid megaship named “ACS Overwatch” that will be stationed in Lambda Arae. Both have been extremely successful, and will shortly be ready to be deployed!

##### Artifact from Our Past

In more recent news, a ship conducting experiments in Sol have revealed a mysterious signal being sent from deep in the Sol system. From the signal being received the scientists have determined that the signal is of a primitive human satellite sent in the early 2000s. Further investigation has revealed it to be 1.7 million Lightseconds away from The Sun, and 1.5 million Lightseconds away from Sedna. Exact directions on the probe are still unknown, and updates will follow when more information is provided.

##### Imperial Navy Training School

Earlier today a request has been sent to the Pilots Federation from the Empire, specifically the Rind Gold Electronics Org faction of the Empire, has submitted a request for a massive amount of materials for a new training school for Imperial starship pilots! The request for a school comes from a training program for pilots that has been going on for quite some time in Achenar, and has been very successful.

If anyone has any feedback about the Bugle or any suggestions for sections or events to report on, I would love to hear it. Thank you to all of my weekly readers for supporting and taking the time to read my articles at the end of each week.
