Content: Tilialaâ€™s Lament is a Megaship introduced into the Akandinigua system around planet 5 when the Conservatives of Tiliala were displaced from their home system. The Conservatives of Tiliala were previously the permit giving faction for Tiliala, so were kept in the galaxy despite being usurped by player faction The Black Fleet. Now both factions can hand out the Tiliala permit, as [announced on Galnet on 11 NOV 3303](https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/5a057eceda59a26bc40b9828).

The megaship is dockable, and despite being a Fleet Operations Carrier has no flight plan.
