## Logs

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground, and within the settlement there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data. There is an automated audio broadcast warning trespassers away.

Around the settlement there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

> 
> **HIDDEN SIGNAL 1/4**
> Personal Log:
> 
> It was here a few days ago I swear. Doctor Lewis said I’m lucky not to be fired for dragging them all out here. But it was right here, the proof that they exist.
> 
> Someone must be messing with me. There is no way that much data can be corrupted without leaving a trace.
> 
> This can’t be right. There seems to be a signal hidden in the corrupted data. I didn’t see it before, and if the data hadn’t been ruined I might never have seen it.

> **HIDDEN SIGNAL 2/4**
> Personal Log:
> 
> I found it, they’ll all think I’m crazy, but I found it.

> It’s definitely not a natural signal or background noise. I’ve run every test I can think of and they all confirm it’s not natural or human in origin.
> 
> Personal Log:
> 
>  I’m afraid to tell anyone about the signal. After last time, Doctor Lewis is reluctant to believe anything.
