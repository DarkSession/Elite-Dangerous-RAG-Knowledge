## Unsolved: Alvin Deefer

Published: 05 Nov 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/unsolved-alvin-deefer/)

Content: The mystery of Alvin Deefer, his ship the Shady Lady, and what Don Antonaci (of [Dixon Dock](https://canonn.science/codex/dixon-dock/) fame) wants with him, are all currently unsolved.

No ship or pilot by that name can be found in the WISE 0855-0714 system, either in super-cruise or at the navigation beacon, and while the system has two Salvageable Wreckage signal sources, and an [Agricultural Installation](https://canonn.science/codex/wise-0855-0714-agricultural-installation/), nothing can be found at either to continue the mystery.

## Listening Posts

The mystery begins with the two listening posts:

### Alpha Centauri B 1

> Signal matches at listening post :George Pantazis
> 
> I don’t want to hear your excuses just find Alvin Defeer, now!
> 
> People have been taking too many liberties and it’s time to make them understand that you don’t cross Don Antonaci and get away with it. I want the Shady Lady found, not tomorrow, not next week. NOW!

> …Signal Terminated at Source…
