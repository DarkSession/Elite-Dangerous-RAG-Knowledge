## AXI Corvette Build

Published: 15 Nov 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/lab69xia/axi-federal-corvette-build/)

Content: The Federal Corvette is quite maneuverable among large ships.  It also sports the largest power distributor of all commercially available ships, which allows it to sustain a high AX DPS while keeping its heat profile relatively low.  Given its high defensive capabilities, the Federal Corvette is among the best ships to take down an interceptor in a short period of time.

Please note the Shield Generator can be swapped for a Prismatic Shield Generator.  You can replace shield boosters with a shutdown field neutralizer or xeno scanner. A xeno scanner is functionally a waste of slot in solo fights, but it is advisable to have at least one person bring a scanner in wings.

**Note that power priorities should be set accordingly to your specific chosen module configuration**
