> 
> **SURVEY TEAM 43 1/5**
> Survey Team 43, Commander’s Log.
> 
>  Ever since we saw that light show in Sector 12, Hopkins has been acting oddly. He’s become reclusive and aggressive, and to be honest I’m starting to worry about him. I think in the morning we’ ll get him checked over by the medic, make sure nothing’s wrong.
> 
> I’ve called command and requested an evac team for Hopkins. He needs medical care that we simply can’t provide.
> 
> They should only take a few days to get here, we can hold the fort till then.

> 
> **SURVEY TEAM 43 2/5**
> Command come in we need help.
> 
> Hopkins escaped custody. He went mad, talking about some mission. He made no sense. Jenkins, Greer and Davies are all dead. We need backup now!
> 
> Damn it he’s taken out the comms! There is no way for us to contact command.
> 
> If the rescue team doesn’t hurry up there won’t be anyone to rescue.

> 
> **SURVEY TEAM 43 3/5**
> Is this thing transmitting?
> 
> Hello? Anyone?
> 
> Control, if you read me, whatever you do, don’t come down here. It’s not safe.
> 
> He’s coming, I’ve got to go.

> 
> **SURVEY TEAM 43 4/5**
> I don’t have long. I think he knows where I am.
> 
> There are no survivors. I’m the last one left.
> 
> My god! He’s found me!

* * *

> 
> **SURVEY TEAM 43 5/5**
> Rescue Team 88 reporting.
> 
> We’ve found a survivor.
> 
> He’s not saying much, just mumbles about his mission. He’s in pretty bad shape and the rest of the crew didn’t survive whatever attacked them out there.
> 
> We’ll bring him back to base. 88 out.
