Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Iburoana system, orbiting body B. 

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be on the hour, every 4 hours, with transmissions reported at: 00:00 / 04:00 / 08:00 / 12:00 / 16:00 / 20:00.

A  “Pirate Ambush” signal source can be found in the Iburoana system, in orbit of body A 1 a. 

The signal source contains an Alliance Passenger Transport with escorts, which may then get attacked by Pirates.

The Passenger Transport will occasionally send out local comm messages, these include:

> 
> Primary here, mission status good. 

> 
> l don‘t have to tell you how important our dignitary is, squadron, so lets keep it professional.

> 
> Remaining escorts, keep running that scan rotation, I want our cargo delivered alive and in one piece. Primary out.

> 
> This is a general broadcast. All passengers in this vessel are under the direct protection of the Alliance. Do not interfere with our flight path.

> 
> Primary calling in. All remaining escorts return security handshakes immediately.

> 
> This is Primary to remaining escorts, tighten up those flight paths, I want full spectrum coverage for our guest.

> 
> This is primary. Package still secure, mission status green.

> 
> Primary to remaining escorts, I don’t like the look of this, raising threat status.

> 
> Broadcasting full spread. This vessel is operating under Alliance authority. Any attempt to harm our passengers will be met with force.

> 
> Primary here, l want a complete weapons check logged before the next check in, squadron. Get on it.

> 
> This is Primary to remaining escorts. Off the record, I can’t wait to get this idiot off my ship.

Since the “Pirate Ambush” signal source is within the Iburoana system, this may well be the correct target for this Unregistered Comms Beacon. However, without the corresponding Herald to decode, this is impossible to confirm.
