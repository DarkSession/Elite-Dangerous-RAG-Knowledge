## Cochi Unregistered Comms Beacon

Published: 20 Dec 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/cochi-unregistered-comms-beacon/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Cochi system, near body 1 and Issigonis Gateway.

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be on the hour, every 4 hours, with transmissions reported at: 00:00 / 04:00 / 08:00 / 12:00 / 16:00 / 20:00. 

The transmitted message is the following:

> 
> 5 14 9 7 13 1 19
> (repeated four times)

Decodes by letter positions to:

> 
> ENIGMAS

This message is the decryption key for an encoded Galnet article in the local Herald:

> Tango Charlie Papa Bravo Quebec Papa Oscar Charlie
> India Alpha Foxtrot Tango Tango Foxtrot India
> November Charlie Bravo Delta Whiskey Foxtrot Bravo
> Tango Alpha Juliet Hotel Papa Uniform Bravo Tango
> Yankee Lima Uniform Bravo Tango Alpha Sierra Golf

The message consists of a series of words that can be interpreted as the NATO phonetic alphabet, yielding the message:

> 
> IPILC-HPJY3F-IFUTCPBFJVCGAJ-KAJASFTCPBQPOCIAFTTFINCBDWFBTAJHPUBTYLUBTASG

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of ENIGMAS taken from the beacon yielded the message:

> 
> COCHI-BODY3A-CAUTIONADVISED-FEDERATIONPOLICEATTACKINGWANTEDBOUNTYHUNTERS

This leads to a permanent POI in the Cochi system, labelled “Staging Area”, around body 3 a.

Upon entering the “Staging Area”, a Federation Police ship may sometimes be seen attacking another ship which has a Wanted status.
