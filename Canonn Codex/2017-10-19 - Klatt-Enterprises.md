## Klatt Enterprises

Published: 19 Oct 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/klatt-enterprises/)

Content: Klatt Enterprises is an abandoned settlement in the Alnath system, on body A 2 a a, at -7.3061, 70.2314 (in Live/4.0) or at 4.0232, 133.5335 (in Legacy/3.8).

The location of this facility was given in the logs found at [Stuart Retreat](https://canonn.science/codex/stuart-retreat/).

It was operated by the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm (INRA), a co-operative between the Federation and Empire that operated during the last war with the Thargoids. This facility appears to have had connections to the project that created the mycoid used against the Thargoids, operating as a weapons-test facility.

The facility contains a large central building, a number of agricultural tents, habitation modules, hangar or barracks buildings, and large tanks marked with the symbol for the mycoid weapon; the ground is stained in a manner consistent with leakage of the agent.

In addition the facility contains a number of silo-like structures: three small, and four large; as well as a very large platform with a crane, with some kind of silo or pit. This facility seems to have been able to contain captured Thargoid ships, and Thargoids themselves, and was the location where the mycoid agent was tested on them.

The pit contains fragments of apparent Thargoid origin.

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground, and within the facility there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

## Logs

Around the facility there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives some of the history of the INRA:

> 
> **HISTORY WILL DECIDE 1/5**
> …Bypassing security protocols…
> …Secure connection established…
> 
> Finally, we have a breakthrough. A researcher at the facility in the Hermitage 4 A system has found something – stumbled onto something, by all accounts – and it’s pushed our research forward dramatically.
> 
> Essentially, it’s a kind of fungus – one that appears to have a significant effect on Thargoid technology. We knew their tech was partly biological, but until now we couldn’t find a way to use that fact to our advantage.
> 
> The theory is that if we could somehow get the fungus into their starships – specifically their hyperdrives – we could shut them down. They’d be unable to leave their system.
> 
> We could end the war in a single stroke.

> **HISTORY WILL DECIDE 2/5**
> …Bypassing security protocols…
> …Secure connection established…
> 
> We have built a dedicated new laboratory so we can properly test the effects of the mycoid. We also have access to an intact Thargoid ship and a living specimen. I plan to test the mycoid on both. Some of my colleagues have expressed reservations about experimenting on a living creature, but I have no such qualms. We must know what the mycoid can do.

> **HISTORY WILL DECIDE 3/5**
> …Bypassing security protocols…
> …Secure connection established…
> 
> Excellent news: we have received a second specimen. We can now accelerate the pace of our testing.
> 
> So far, our experiments indicate that the fungus affects not only the Thargoids’ technology but also their physiology, as evidenced by the degeneration of our specimen. These results are highly encouraging. If the mycoid can hurt them – truly hurt them – we may have found the means to win this war.
> 
> Several of my colleagues have left the project in protest over our treatment of the creature. If it were up to me, I would have them executed as traitors.

> 
> **HISTORY WILL DECIDE 4/5**
> …Bypassing security protocols…
> …Secure connection established…
> 
> Our latest tests were extremely successful. The mycoid can paralyse a Thargoid system – either physical or technological – in a matter of seconds. It is extremely effective.
> 
> I confess: the knowledge that the mycoid causes the Thargoids physical pain brings me some measure of satisfaction. But when one has seen, first hand, the effect of their weapons – seen the destruction, the chaos, the bodies – can one be blamed for wanting them to suffer, as we have?

> 
> **HISTORY WILL DECIDE 5/5**
> …Bypassing security protocols…
> …Secure connection established…
> 
> The haulers have departed for the HIP 59382 1 B system with the samples, ready to start mass production. We know the mycoid works. Now it falls to other members of the project to determine how it can be effectively deployed.
> 
> I know there are some who will condemn me for my part in this project. Let them. I harbour no remorse.
> 
> The Thargoids understand only one thing: destruction. They will not stop until every last one of us has been reduced to dust. We have created a weapon that can prevent such a catastrophe. We have a moral obligation to use it.
