## AXI FAS Repair Limpet Build

Published: 24 Oct 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/lab69xia/axi-fas-repair-limpet-build/)

Content: The FAS is lacking in shield capacity and firepower, however, it has amazing yaw speed. Beware the fragile cockpit and exposed power distributor.   Variant that sacrifices some hull for ability to repair.
