Content: The Gordon-class Hauler is a class of Bulk Cargo Ship.

The class consists of two long struts containing cargo containers, mounted at 45º to each other, both backed by an engineering module and single-engine drive module, with a conn tower on the port drive module.

The Ship Log Uplink is generally mounted on the conn tower, with the Cargo Bay and its defending Turret below the tower towards the drive modules body.

Its default Cargo of around 280 tons is Industrial Materials and Metals.

A Gordon-class hauler with call-sign MEH-686 can be found for reference at the following waypoints: Mehua, Mehua, Wikmeang, Wikmeang, Wikmeang, Wikmeang.

- Number of Turrets: 1
- Cargo Bays: 1
- Total Cargo: ~280t
- Default Cargo: *Industrial Materials* (Insulating Membrane, Neofabric Insulation, Semiconductors),

*Metals* (Beryllium, Copper, Gallium, Lithium, Palladium, Silver, Tantalum, Titanium)
- Rare Commodity Sub-Types: Metals
