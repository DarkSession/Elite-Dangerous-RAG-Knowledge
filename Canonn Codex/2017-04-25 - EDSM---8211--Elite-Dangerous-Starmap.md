Content: EDSM is a highly useful tool in use by many Canonn members, best described by the EDSM team themselves:

> 
> EDSM (Elite Dangerous Star Map) was at first a community effort to store and calculate systems coordinates around the Elite: Dangerous galaxy.
> 
> It is now the main API used by dozens of software and websites to find systems, coordinates, information (governement, allegiance, faction…) and celestial bodies (types, materials…).
> 
> EDSM has become a must-have for all respectable explorers, and commanders in the galaxy, with it you can:
> 
> 
> - Track your flight log
> - Track your fleet
> - Track your ranks
> - Write your logbook
> - Write comments and bookmark explored systems
