#### *All in the name of Science* lyrics

> 
> Born on the shoulders
> of 10 thousand cmdrs
> Hauling goods to see
> what community could do
> ‘for Science’
> 
> 3 days to shift it all
> We’d never seen such a mountain moved by people
> good people
> with a goal
> 
> Asimov class
> oh so vast
> The very first one to break that barrier,
> not a carrier just a dream
> jumping now into that sky
> looking for the how and the when and the why
> Gnosis and Canonn what a team
> 
> ***All in the name of Science*** every sector every jump
> ***All in the name of Science*** with our thirst for knowledge only it could quench
> as we searched
> and we saw
> and we measured
> in the blackness of this galaxy we shall find
> we shall find….
> we shall find….
> 
> Cone sector 3304
> the brave Gnosis tried to open up the door
> to take a peak behind those Thargoid lines
> with 21 thousand clammering souls onboard
> morning broke and so did our hearts
> Gnosis stricken by Thargoid dark arts
> friendly fire took lives, as Thargoids lost their minds but we prevailed and Canonn held the line
> everyone hold the line 
> 
> *(cmdr chatter)I can’t get off the pad we are under constant firenon humans signals everywhereThargoid scouts are bouncing across me, THIS IS INSANEI am under fire, EVERYONE IS UNDER FIREShields falling, hull criticalWe need help out here!!I’m not here to fight I came here to exploreMayday Asp Explorer coming in too hotFriendly fire activeDo not use weapons inside the no fire zoneI repeat do not use weaponsInterceptors coming in, they have the yellow fireWhere is fighter support, where is any supportI’m jumping out, this is too muchGnosis under fire, toxic weapons attacking hullbugging this too much*
