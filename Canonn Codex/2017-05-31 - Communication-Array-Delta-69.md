## Communication Array Delta 69

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/communication-array-delta-69/)

Content: Communication Array Delta 69 is an abandoned settlement in the Col 285 Sector BG-O d6-93 system on body AB 1 d, at 27.8797, -35.5017 (in Live/4.0) or at -5.8360, 177.3793 (in Legacy/3.8).

The location of this site can be found by following the three nearby listening posts located in:
Pulano / Col 285 Sector KO-E b26-3 / HIP 97146

CMDR Steve Kirby identified [a flaw in the Listening Post firmware](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/missing-poi-for-sjk-378-a-b-c-listening-posts.340466/) that meant this decoding provided the wrong co-ordinate, he provided an improved decoding that led to the site. The Listening Posts themselves may still give the incorrect decoding until the firmware update propagates throughout the network.

## Logs

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground, and within the settlement there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data. 

Around the settlement there are five Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

> Internal Message Log Fragment:
> 
> Erm… Control, we’ve got a problem down here at Hab B. I’m going to need someone from security down here on the double.
> 
> We’ve found a body, and before you ask, it’s not one of us. All personnel are present and accounted for.
> 
> You’re going to think I’m crazy. There’s no way this guy should be out here. It’s not like a dead body can be classed as personal effects but he’s here all right, just appeared out of nowhere.

> Wilkins is right, we’re going to have to inform the authorities about this. But how do we do that, they’ll think we’re either crazy, or worse, that we’ve killed this guy. It doesn’t matter that there isn’t a mark on him, or that according to our medic there is no cause of death. No disease, no poison or radiation.
> 
> We’ve looked up this ship and it’s disappearance. Some kind of anomaly causing the ship to just vanish without a trace. These things are just stories that the deep space explorers tell to make their job seem more interesting than just scanning stars and planets. Nothing like that actually exists or we would know about it.

> I need to report this.

> It started this morning, everything seemed normal but there was an uneasiness among the team. No one could put a finger on it, just a general feeling that something was wrong. And then the signal started.
> 
> It was about 10km from the station and appeared to be some kind of radio transmission, with a digital data packet encoded into it. We spent hours trying to figure out how to decipher it but I have to say at the moment we don’t have a clue what we’re dealing with here.
> 
> Along with the signal, something has appeared on the planet’s surface that according to our surveys simply can’t be there. There is a gravitational pull of some massive object but there’s nothing we can detect physically there. The gravitational field measured approximately 0.1 Gs, but we can’t see what’s creating it. Whatever it is, it’s the source of the signal.
> 
> We’ve sent a skimmer out with some equipment as a probe. I’m not going to risk anyone going out there until we know what we’re dealing with.

> 
> I’ve ordered everyone out, locked off the infirmary until I can figure out what is going on. Signal is building stronger… people started feeling it… like it was in our heads.

> I don’t know what to tell you sir, there’s no one here. No bodies, no sign of any problem, all the automated systems are A OK, just no one is here. It’s like they just vanished.
> 
> Yes I know how that sounds. All the security logs on the door say nobody left, the ships and escape pods are still in place. They left their belongings, food, water, clothing.
> 
> Yes, sir. Yes I Understand. Securing the station logs now, sir.
> 
> Team 963 out.

A search was done by CMDR Marxanthius for the signal by doing a look out from the settlement to 10 kilometres but found nothing.
