Content: ## **The Guardians**

The Guardians were a technologically advanced humanoid race that colonized an area of the Orion arm before humans mastered interstellar travel. They were a strongly communal society arranged in co-operative city-states. They used a system of monoliths to share information between settlements many light-years apart. The Guardians had a strong spiritual connection to their environment, and carefully managed their impact on the world around them, maintaining a connection to their pack-hunter origins. They were highly adept at genetic manipulation and used this to modify both themselves, and their environment to improve quality of life, or to wage war. Although peaceful for the majority of their history, technological disparity gave rise to two major conflicts. The second of these was an ideological and religious war fought in response to the increasing technological advancements facilitated by artificial intelligence. Sadly the escalating automation of this war destroyed the habitat and majority of the population of the Guardians’ home world. Only now are humans discovering the remains of this once great civilization, and there are many questions left unanswered.
