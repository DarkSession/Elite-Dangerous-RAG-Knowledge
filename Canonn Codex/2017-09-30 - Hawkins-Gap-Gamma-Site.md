## Hawkins Gap Gamma Site

Published: 30 Sep 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/hawkins-gap-gamma-site/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Plaa Aec TT-B b41-3 system, orbiting body B 1.

The transmission times of this beacon are on the hour, every hour.

The transmitted message is the following:

* * *

> 
> DYJEPQY UWLUDCQCKJ XUEOKJ
> DJPQY P6 UNL001
> NEHHY LKCJQ X2
> BEVGCJP AEL
> LHEE EUO QQX X41 3
> IKDUPQEJDXY
> (repeated two times)

Note: There are two separate UCB’s occupying the same position, while they both transmit the same message, the second UCB’s transmission times are at 30 minutes past the hour, every hour.

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of EXODUS yields the message:

> 
> DYNASTY EXPEDITION BEACON
> DNSTY S6 ERP001
> RALLY POINT B2
> HAWKINS GAP
> PLAA AEC TTB B41 3
> MODESTANDBY

An abandoned settlement can be found within the same system on body B 2, at -9.3287, -103.8558 (in Live/4.0 and Legacy/3.8).

Within the settlement there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

Around the settlement there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

> “Funny Thing is, I’ve asked a few of the other hands about this mission and no one seems to know who’s behind it. We all picked up bulletin board adverts promising big credits for a long haul and kind of just ended up on board. Not sure it it’s the Feds, the Imps or the Alliance. Still, credits are credits!”
