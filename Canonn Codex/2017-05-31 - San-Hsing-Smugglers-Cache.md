## San Hsing Smugglers Cache

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/sanhsing-smugglers-cache/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in orbit of Morra A 2. 

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be on the hour, every 4 hours, with transmissions reported at: 00:00 / 04:00 / 08:00 / 12:00 / 16:00 / 20:00. 

The transmitted message is the following:

> 
> 16 1 20 8 6 9 14 4 5 18
> (repeated four times)

Decodes by letter positions to:

> 
> PATHFINDER

This message is the decryption key for an encoded Galnet article in the local Herald:
*(Note: this Herald is no longer available – March 3310)*

> 
> **THE MORRA HERALD**
> 25 Oct 3302
> 
> \*\*\*Compromised Carrier Signal\*\*\*
> 
> Tango Bravo Golf Delta Tango Foxtrot Golf Mike –
> Alpha Papa Bravo Golf India Charlie Kilo – Tango
> Quebec Uniform Mike Mike Papa India Juliet Tango
> Lima Bravo Lima Delta India – Tango Bravo Echo India

The message consists of a series of words that can be interpreted as the NATO phonetic alphabet, yielding the message:

> 
> TBFDTFGM-APBGICK-TQUMMPIJTLBLDI-TBEI

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of PATHFINDER taken from the beacon yielded the message:

> 
> SANHSING-PLANETB-SMUGGLERSCACHE-SAFE

This leads to an “Anomalous Signal Detected” signal source in orbit of the star San Hsing B containing a number of canisters of commodities.

Not of any known scientific interest.
