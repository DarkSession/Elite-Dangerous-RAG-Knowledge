An automated alert voice indicates that the cause of the evacuation was a compromise of the mine structure.

The miners clearly abandoned the settlement in a hurry as there are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground. At the entrance to the settlement there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

## Logs

Around the settlement there are six Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives more background:

> 
> Guys, pack it up, we’re heading back to base! Something’s not right here, comms are down and with that last quake, I’m calling it.

> Follow me, we’ll head for shaft 48, there’s a wired comms station there, maybe we can find out what’s happening.
