> Wash your hands after using the biowaste in your cargo hold to attempt to make a garden. Seriously, hygiene is important, who knows what this stuff is. It smells terrible and really doesn’t taste very nice. I might not be making another message for a while.

> Make sure your ship has a cabin you can seal off after you’ve had an eye watering stomach bug. Plastic and duct tape are not essential to seal the door, but they can make the job easier and prevent leaks.

> Maybe I should have put the plastic on the floor first.

> 
> If you’re trying to grow your own food there is no point in planting food cartridges. They don’t grow.
> 
> However, the algae in the air purifiers will grow like crazy so no need to plant anything, just scrape the stuff off the filters and you’ve got yourself a top notch dining experience for one.
