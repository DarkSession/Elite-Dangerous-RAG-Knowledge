 Subject: Eagle Eye Report Week 18 - 06/07/3304

This week saw the encounters of new types of Thargoid vessel. Both scout and cyclops class. The Thargoids have called in what we can only describe as re-enforcement. This new vessels which we have been encountering have new forms or weaponry which can reduce hull armor in small bursts. Investigation of Guardian sites is continuing in the hopes of finding new technologies to assist in the defense of human populated space.

This week the systems which the Thargoids have targeted are Tembala and Nogambe. All types of NHSS are present including the new types of vessels previously described. 

On a much more positive note Titan's Daughter in the Taygeta system has been successfully repaired by operation IDA and the thousands of independent commanders who took part.
