> The Hull mining corporation is conducting a search-and-rescue operation in the Altair system following a pirate attack. Many mining vessels and their pilots were lost in the attack, and some remain missing.
> 
> One ship – the Jack Attack, piloted by Bigboo – attempted to fight off the pirates, and some reports described the vessel giving chase. There has been no sign of the ship since the attack, four days ago, and Bigboo’s family have begun to fear the worst.
> 
> Security forces have released Bigboo’s last transponder signal, which was detected in the LP 926-40 system, to aid in the search.

This leads to a Listening Post in LP 926-40 system, in orbit of body A 1, which gives the location of the installation:

A Type-9 Heavy named the Jack Attack, piloted by an Elite NPC named Big Boo, can be found in the structure, and appears to be accompanied by other smaller ships.
