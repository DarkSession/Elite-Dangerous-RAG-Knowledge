Published: 17 Feb 2025 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/brokutsu-crashed-ship/)

Content: A crashed Eagle can be found at a Crashed Ship POI in the Brokutsu system on body 3 a, at -1.5262, -179.3469 (in Live/4.0 and Legacy/3.8).

The crashed ship has a Ship Data Core that can be scanned for a log, as well as a few various commodities behind it.

The crashed ship is also right next to a surface installation named “Stott’s Inheritance”, which contains Data Point that can be scanned for a small amount of Engineer Data and an Intel Package.

### Log:

  PILOT LOG FINAL ENTRY

Junior, if you’re reading this, then you’ve found my ship.

I don’t know what shot me down, the scanner was clear all the way up to impact.

I’ve looked around and the site’s been cleared out, if you’ve got an SRV maybe it can strip something they missed from the refuge computers.

I’m activating my emergency beacon. Our family’s rescue insurance should be valid in this system, somebody’s bound to pick me up soon. I hope.

I’ll see you back at the barn.

Fly safe,

Uncle Stan
