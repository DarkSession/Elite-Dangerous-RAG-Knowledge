Content: Comms Installation found in orbit of Warkan 1. Lots of flight traffic around, will often scan you for cargo. Two satellites and a Navigation Beacon present – satellites will give data if scanned. Installation is to one side of the planet’s rings, not in the centre, so can only be approached from one side without passing through the ring.

The NPC traffic often talks about research *“Eat your heart out, Palin. This is real science. Come on guys, let’s science the hell out of this thing”* etc.
