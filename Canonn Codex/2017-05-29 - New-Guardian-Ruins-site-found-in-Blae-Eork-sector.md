Published: 29 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/news/new-guardian-ruins-site-found-in-blae-eork-sector/)

Content: *Cmdr Zed* reports on the Threadnought that while out exploring the Eta Carina Nebula he found 3 ancient ruins sites on *Blae Eork QU-D D13-3 3*.  This is perhaps significant given the distance from the other ruins sites.

The 3 sites are at coordinates:

- 25.6366 / 76.1155
- 1.2283 / 50.7668
- 11.8447 / -56.0513
