Content: As most are aware *Salome* was killed during the event on the 29th April. While being escorted on her tour from just outside the Witchhead Nebula to the Tionisla system she became separated from her guard and was ambushed less than a 100 light years from her destination. While her compatriots made it safely back into hiding after revealing the location of a string of *listening posts* that revealed a tale of mind-wipes and shadow conspiracies. This report also brings an update on mysterious reports of new findings in *Distress Beacons* in the *Maia* nebula from Commander HSKelvin.
