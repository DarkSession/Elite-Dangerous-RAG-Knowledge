## Collared Pod

Published: 22 Jan 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/collared-pod/)

Content: There are several varieties of Collared Pods to be found around the galaxy – they can be found in the same sector as the human bubble, so are relatively easy to visit. They appear inside Notable Stellar Phenomena. Look for the largest concentration of signals inside the phenomena and you should find them (if they are present).

In-game codex information shows that the different variants appear near different planet types, and have different requirements for Star Types – more can be found in the game codex.

Space lifeforms often have discoverable traits – scan them with the Composition Scanner when they are doing something to reveal the traits. For Rubicundum Collared Pods these are the traits:

- Turns towards ship if approached

If you have Research Limpets some varieties can be sampled and various type of sample are returned. Sampling these pods returns Pod Core Tissue, Pod Surface Tissue and Pod Dead Tissue samples (it has been reported that Albidum cannot be sampled).  There are no known uses for these samples. The samples are not corrosive.
