## CFN Special Report: Gnosis Arrival

Published: 19 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/news/cfn-special-report-gnosis-arrival/)

Content: The successful Canonn CG has resulted in the **Canonn Megaship** arriving in Varati.  The megaship – named *Gnosis* – is an Asimov class science vessel with an estimated by unproven jump distance of 2,500 light years.  The fully operational science vessel will be a test-bed for many Canonn initiatives as the ship is moved around the galaxy to areas of specific scientific interest having been built for long term deep-space engagements. As such, her time here in the bubble in Varati will be one of the few periods when the vessel will be easily accessible for the pilot community at large.
