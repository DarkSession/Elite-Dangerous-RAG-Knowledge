## Logs

Also at the back of the site is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

Within the site there are a number of automated mining extractors from which can be obtained Indium, Gallite, and Cobalt.

At the back of the site are three Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:
