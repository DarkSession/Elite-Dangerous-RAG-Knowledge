## The Gnosis

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/the-gnosis/)

Content: The ship was constructed by an appeal to the wider community, and provides docking, repair, outfitting, and market services to all. It originally moved on a weekly schedule decided by the membership and council to conduct science throughout the galaxy, but in September 3306 the megaship retired from active science duty to instead carry out a set itinerary, which you can find below.

The current location is tracked by tools such as EDSM and EDDB – with **the current** location shown below courtesy of EDSM.
