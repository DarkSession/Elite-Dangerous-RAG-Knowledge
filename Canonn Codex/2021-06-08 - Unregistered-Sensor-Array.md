## Unregistered Sensor Array

Published: 08 Jun 2021 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/kidnapped/)

Content: Unregistered Sensor Array is a small surface base in the Synuefe KN-J a77-3 system on body 1, at 5.8560, -44.9992 (in Live/4.0) or at 17.1330, -96.8008 (in Legacy/3.8).

The location of this site can be found by following the three nearby listening posts located in:
Wregoe PD-K d8-40 / Wregoe DZ-D b39-6 / Synuefe KN-A a82-0

Note: The listening post in Wregoe DZ-D b39-6 is some distance from the star and you will need to scan the system with the FSS to find it.

> Help me… Please help me… I don’t know how I got here.

> Last thing I remember I was on a transport heading to the edge of habitable space. I remember having a drink with the crew and then it all goes blank.
> 
> I’m on a ship, I can’t tell what kind, but it’s old and rusting. I think we’re docked, there is no sound of the engines.
> 
> Whoever kidnapped me didn’t search me very well. I still have my pack, comms and portable terminal. Must have been in a hurry.
> 
> Help me please.

> **KIDNAPPED 2/4**
> Unidentified Broadcast:
> 
> It’s been days, I hear mumbling outside, but no one has spoken to me. I scream and scream, but no answer.
> 
> They are feeding me, if you can call what I find in my cell every morning ‘food’. I’m guessing they don’t want to kill me or why bother kidnapping me? Maybe they think I’m someone else and expect to get a ransom.
> 
> But I’m a nobody. I work in logistics and trade systems. No one is going to pay a ransom for me. Oh god, they left the door to my cell open. What is this place.

> Oh god, they left the door to my cell open. What is this place.
> 
> There are dozens of rooms, full of people or what’s left of people. And strange smells, some of it filth from the cells but there is something else… What is that smell? Smells like cooking meat.
> 
> My guts are rumbling, maybe I can find some real food.
> 
> Wait…What……..

> 
> **KIDNAPPED 4/4**
> Little Rabbits shouldn’t go snooping or they might end up in the cooking pot like the others.
> 
> Not, yet… Not it’s turn… Needs fattening up first, all skin and bones this one.
> 
> Quite Right, Mr Quince. This lady needs to wait her turn. Besides we really should do something about those messages you sent. Don’t worry, we’re not monsters… At least not the kind of monsters you think we are.
