Content: ‚Äú***B** **ack in my day, we had to walk to Arcanonn‚Äôs office. Uphill.. both ways.. without shoes or atmosphere***.‚Äù

You‚Äôve all heard how it was back in the day. Credits were hard to come by and life was hard. Well now is your chance to join Canonn members to relive those days with the **Canonn Caravan**.

From **Friday 25th to Sunday 27th of August**, we‚Äôll be having a good old rares route posted, with a flight schedule.

Basic idea is that the route starts 16:00 server time on each day and it‚Äôs cut up in 1 hour segments. Each segment contains 8-9 stops and 5-10 minutes to chill (or catch up if you got held up). To join, just [**check the schedule**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/180545013891989505/347962912737853462/Rare_Goods_Route_and_schedule_2.pdf) where the caravan is when you‚Äôre able to play and go to there. The whole route is about 8 hours long so I reckon that not many will do it in one sitting anyway. You can do this in Open, Private group or Solo. And in any platform. After all, it‚Äôs just trading.

This is more of an social even than gaining credits. Filling out your **friends list** is the best outcome üôÇ

Around 140 cargo space should be good if you don‚Äôt want to miss any profits. There‚Äôs 2 Outposts in the route, so bigger ships will have to just skip those stops. Also 2 systems are going to be permit locked (Shinrarta Dezhra and Vega), so if you don‚Äôt have the permits, just skip them.

If you don‚Äôt want to fly a trade ship but want to just **hang out** with other Canonneers, there‚Äôs always room for escorts. And as for those who are now interested in robbing our traders: ‚Äú*Do not just murder everyone ‚Äôcause they‚Äôre easy targets. Get some cargo instead.*‚Äù

P.S. Don‚Äôt worry about the timezones. Route is scheduled twice in a row so most timezones are taken in account.
