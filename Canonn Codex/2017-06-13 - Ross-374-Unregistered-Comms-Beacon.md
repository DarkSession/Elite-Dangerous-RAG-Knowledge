## Ross 374 Unregistered Comms Beacon

Published: 13 Jun 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/ross-374-unregistered-comms-beacon/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Ross 374 system, orbiting body A 3. 

The transmission times of this beacon are 30 minutes past the hour, every hour.

The transmitted message is the following:

* * *

> 
> COVERUP OVERLOOK
> SECRET MUST BE SHARED
> PLEIADES SECTOR OI T C3 7
> ORCUS CRAG
> (repeated six times)

Note: There are actually two Unregistered Comms Beacon’s at this location, one where the POI marker is, and another approximately 26 km’s away. The beacon that is further away will transmit on the hour, rather than at 30 minutes past the hour, however the transmitted message is the same.

The message is apparently from Professor Palin, who placed a Community Goal at Orcus Crag to collect Unknown Ship Signature and Unknown Wake Signature data from encounters with Thargoid vessels.

[Overlook](https://canonn.science/codex/overlook/) is the name of a Megaship currently located in the permit locked HIP 22460 system.

The location of the beacon was revealed in a [video broadcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXegy12VG6o&amp;t=800s) by CMDR EdLewis on 12 June 3303 in which he received the following message:

> I intercepted a beacon in the Ross 374 system. I thought it was just salvage until it burst into life. It transmits a message once an hour, at half past the hour. It seems to run on a timer.
> 
> I was transcribing the code when a bunch of black ships appeared. They said I had violated some code or other, and opened fire. I made it out alive, but my ship is in tatters.
> 
> I’m running for my life. Hopefully I can make it to Dunker’s Rest.
> 
> Oh God, no. How did they find me?

> Ed, if you get this, you have to find the beacon. There’s something that-
