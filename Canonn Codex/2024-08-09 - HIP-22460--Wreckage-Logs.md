Upon entering the HIP 22460 system on the 9th August 3308 sent out a message, warning Commanders to withdraw:

* * *

> 
> **ALERT: HIP 22460 EVACUATION**
> \*PILOTS’ FEDERATION ALERT\*
> 
> All Commanders are urged to withdraw from HIP 22460 immediately.
> 
> The Proteus Wave device created by Salvation failed to eliminate Thargoid forces in this system. An energy pulse of unknown origin, deployed shortly after the device‘s activation, shut down all human ships in the system. The majority of the human fleet was destroyed by Thargoid forces as a result.
> 
> Surviving pilots have been advised to retreat to a safe system. Further information will be provided via Galnet.
> 
> HIP 22460 is now under Thargoid control. The area is considered extremely dangerous. We have not yet confirmed whether further shut down pulses remains a possibility.
> 
> Commanders who choose to investigate the aftermath of humanity’s defeat in HIP 22460 should ensure their vessels are appropriately outfitted for Thargoid encounters.

Further investigation in the HIP 22460 system uncovered numerous debris fields, some of which contain the logs of those who perished after the failed Proteus Wave activation.

> I don’t have much time. I guess if you’re sweeping the debris you’ll hear people say that a lot. I’d apologise but I have my own problems right now.
> 
> Fleet command need to be brought to justice. All of them, all three superpowers. They sold us out to Salvation.
> 
> Have you been hearing his announcements? How he’s gonna save humanity and write history? This was all for his ego and his stupid fixation on defeating the Thargoids. And our admirals bought it. ‘Sure. we’ll deploy hundreds of thousands of people to back you up, no sweat. What could go wrong?’
> 
> EVERYTHING went wrong, you idiots!
> 
> Whatever it was that took my power out hit us all. The Thargoids sure woke up, though. I’ve mostly been watching them blow ships apart. Mostly.
> 
> Some escape pods had already been deployed by the time everything went bad. I swear the Thargoids are scooping them Up. Can you imagine? I hope whatever happens to the people inside is quick. Nobody deserves to be experimented on or ground into burgers or whatever.
> 
> I don’t think I’ll be around to see justice served, so good luck. Tell ‘em Emma Fairchild said they’re all scumbags.

> 
> The fighting continued right up until the first wave went off. The Thargoids went offline, all the lights on their hulls out. The conflict was over.
> 
> We had maybe a minute to celebrate before another wave hit us. Salvation failed. Why did we ever believe he could stop them. Nothing can stop them. Not now.

> I don’t know what it was but… but…

> ————
> 
> We’ve been told for so many months now that Salvation is the answer. The war will end through his actions, not ours. Like he’s some messiah.
> 
> Have people lost faith in the military? The ADF has fought these creatures for years now. Sure, there have been setbacks. but there have been plenty of victories as well. I was there when the Alliance secured the Witch Head Nebula enclave. We drove the Thargoids back and gave them a few wounds to lick. Gave the Imps and Feds something to think about, too.
> 
> Now we’ve bet all our chips on Salvation’s cards. Here in HIP 22460 we’ve lost thousands of good people keeping his back covered while he builds this wondering contraption. I truly hope it works. because a lot has been sacrificed to give the Proteus Wave a chance.

> Having reviewed the reports of the Proteus Site’s power systems, I am delighted to see that all results are within optimal parameters. Quite the feat given that this is a unique weapon, never before seen by humanity, which incorporates mechanisms from two alien races.
> 
> The Guardian technology is remarkable. So versatile in application. I believe we have merely scratched the surface of its capability, but further developments will come in time. When the Thargoids have been eradicated.
> 
> I had the chance to speak with Salvation. Only briefly, and only to clarify a specific aspect of the Proteus Wave’s function. There is a magnetism to the man’s demeanour. He is ancient, of course, and wears his years wholly. But Salvation gave me his full attention for perhaps thirty seconds, and I admit to feeling intimidated by his focus.
> 
> Then, my question answered, he moved on. Not a moment wasted on pleasantries. Understandable. There is far too much to do, of course.

> The Thargoids are an ancient race, too blind to realise their time has passed. Over the centuries l have, admittedly, found a grudging respect for them. The creatures are equally intelligent and ruthless.
