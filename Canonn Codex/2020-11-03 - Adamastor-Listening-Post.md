## Adamastor Listening Post

Published: 03 Nov 2020 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/adamastor-listening-post/)

Content: The Listening Post can be found in the Synuefe XE-Y c17-7 system, around body 3 a. The location matches the description found in the flight of the Adamastor, so it is believed that the Listening Post is related. 

It was found by following a path from Chukchan through HIP 39748 and HIP 33386 and travelling for around 370 Ly then looking for a K class star with 11 bodies. It is believed that the Listening Post will probably point to [Site 23B](https://canonn.science/codex/geological-survey-23b/ "Geological Survey 23B").

Note that the message has been found to be slightly different in various localisations – notably in French the ‘WEST’ text is ‘OUEST’. 

The message has been at least partially decoded by [MichaelWhatever on the forums](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/cryptic-elite-instagram-twitter-posts.557207/post-8780281 "https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/cryptic-elite-instagram-twitter-posts.557207/post-8780281") – splitting it into 8 character lines you can see the text ‘615 LY’ (the distance to the Coal Sack system) and BODY 3 embedded in the text.
