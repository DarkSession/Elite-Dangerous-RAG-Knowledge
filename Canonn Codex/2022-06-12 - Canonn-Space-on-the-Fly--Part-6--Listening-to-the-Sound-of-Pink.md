During Waypoint 2 there is an [Alcatraz-class Reformatory](https://canonn.science/codex/alcatraz-class-prison-ship/)to visit. During Waypoint 4 a [Thomas-class Hauler](https://canonn.science/codex/thomas-class-bulk-cargo-ship/).

**6.1.2 Barsanti Legacy: Civillian Outpost**

Barsanti Legacy is a Civillian Outpost. On one of its sides you can find a double structure for towing larger ships. We’ll sell the Mineral Oil and load up Silver.

The [Agricultural Installation](https://canonn.science/tag/agricultural-installation/) Crooked Valley Meadows is directly at the Main Star.

**6.2.2 WP 1 + 6: Megaships (B 2 a – 262 ls)**

During Waypoint 1 and Waypoint 6 there is a [Lowell-class Researcher](https://canonn.science/codex/lowell-class-science-vessel/)in system.

**6.2.3 Xiaoguan Station: Human Technology Broker (B 4 – 270 ls)**

Xiaoguan has the only human Technology Broker in Canonn Space. We will pick up Mineral Extractors.

**6.3.1 Universal Transmission Satellite: Comms Installation (A 7 a – 616,15 ls)**

Kabijao has two [Comms Installations](https://canonn.science/tag/comms-installation/), we are heading for Universal Transmission Satellite around A 7 a.

**6.3.2 WP 1, 4 +6: Megaships**

During Waypoint 1 and 4 there is a [Freedom-class Surveyor](https://canonn.science/codex/freedom-class-surveyor/) in system. During Waypoint 6 a [Hogan-class Hauler](https://canonn.science/codex/hogan-class-bulk-cargo-ship/) is to visit.

- jump 31,95 ly to Jarildekald

**6.4. Jarildekald**

- *Mining Outpost*
- *Megaship: WP 2*

**6.4.1 Reed Stop: Mining Outpost (3 – 156,13 ls)**

Reed Stop is a Mining Outpost. After Docking listen a moment to the atmosphere – depending on your audio settings the soundscape has spooked more than one commander. We’ll sell our Mineral Extractors and pick up Tritium.

- sell Mineral Extractors
- buy Tritium

**6.4.2 WP 2: Megaship (12, 3115 ls)**

During Waypoint 2 there is a [Bowman Class Researcher](https://canonn.science/codex/bowman-class-science-vessel/) in system. 

- jump 9,45 ly to Suhte

**6.5. Suhte**

- *Industrial Installation*
- *Military Outpost*
- *Megaships: WP 1, 3 + 5*

**6.5.1 Secret Belt Manufacture: Industrial Installation (A – 12,3 ls)**

Directly at entry there is the [Industrial Installation](https://canonn.science/tag/industrial-installation/) Secret Belt Manufacture.

**6.5.2 Bester Prospect: Military Outpost (B 3 – 5483 ls)**

We are trecking out to Bester Prospect. It is a Military Outpost, refurbished to a trading hub under Canonns control, as is its sister outpost Benyovszky Survey. Military Outposts are the rarest type of orbital outposts.

It’s a test piece for every smuggler to get to dock at such an outpost without getting scanned. You can try it without any illegals on board.

Suhte itself had a lot of traffic before fleetcarriers, as it was listed as the closest shipyard to the engineer system Khun (some commanders can’t compare time neded to jump a distance and supercruise time). 

The main station also has a raw material trader. Getting into control at Suhte and triggering further conflicts for the other orbital stations needed some patience and took advantage of bubble-wide events drawing Khun-related-traffic away for some time. 

We’ll sell our Tritium and don’t pick up anything, as we are going to visit a RES-site next system.

- sell Tritium

**6.5.3 WP 1, 3 + 5: Megaships**

During Waypoint 1 there is a [Riker-class Reformatory](https://canonn.science/codex/riker-class-prison-ship/) in system. During Waypoints 3 and 5 a [Bellmarsh-class Reformatory](https://canonn.science/codex/bellmarsh-class-prison-ship/).

- – jump 22,85 ly to 31 Cephei

**6.6 31 Cephei**

- *Megaship: WP 4*
- *RES around star*

**6.6.1 WP 4: Megaship**

During Waypoint 4 there is a [Naphtha-class Tanker](https://canonn.science/codex/naphtha-class-tanker/) in system.

**6.6.2 31 Cephei 13: Res around star (3362 ls)**

Cephei 13 is an Y-Dwarf with Ressource Extraction sites in its rings. Another exampel can be found in Kashis, which is a bit more lilac and has only a Hazardous and a Low Ressource Extraction Site. If you prefer your hunting grounds lighted with a tint of pink, these Res-sites are just for you.

- jump 32,42 to 34 Omicron Cephei
