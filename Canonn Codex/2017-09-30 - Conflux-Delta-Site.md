Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Pru Aescs NC-M d7-192 system, orbiting body A 2 a.

The transmission times of this beacon are on the hour, every hour.

The transmitted message is the following:

* * *

> 
> DYJEPQY UWLUDCQCKJ XUEOKJ
> DJPQY P6 UNL002
> NEHHY LKCJQ E3E
> OKJSHRW
> LNR EUPOP JOI D7 192
> IKDUPQEJDXY
> (repeated two times)

* * *

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of EXODUS yields the message:

> 
> DYNASTY EXPEDITION BEACON
> DNSTY S6 ERP002
> RALLY POINT A3A
> CONFLUX
> PRU AESCS NCM D7 192
> MODESTANDBY

An abandoned settlement can be found within the same system on body A 3 a, at -53.3585, -48.9083 (in Live/4.0 and Legacy/3.8).

Around the settlement there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

> “I’m just the engineer on this particular jaunt. I was advised to prep the ship for a seriously long haul into the void, so I’m loaded up with as many hyperdrive spares as I can cram in. When I asked why, the captain just responded with ‘Don’t ask’.”

Odds are even as to whether the heat, gravity or magnetism kills us first. We’re jettisoning the logs, if anyone ever finds this… save yourselves! Beware the neutron star.”
