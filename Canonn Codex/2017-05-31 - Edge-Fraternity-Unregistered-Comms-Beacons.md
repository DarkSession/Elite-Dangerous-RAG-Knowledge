Content: Unregistered Comms Beacons deployed by the Edge Fraternity can be found in orbit of few worlds:

| System | Body |
| --- | --- |
| Athena | AB 2 |
| Jitabos | 2 |
| LHS 3447 | B 1 a |
| Munfayl | More ( 1 ) |

Each of the beacons are identical and are known to transmit the following, at 00 minutes past every hour:

> 
> PKH HTSH ELOPHLFYPX UGQCT CYBH PG UYMK OCC WLORH IYCGPM DOBYFS PKH AGQLFHX PG NGCGFYO O MOEH OFT ICHOMHFP AGQLFHX
> (repeated four times)

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of OWNTHESKY, the source of which is not known, yielded the message:

> 
> THE EDGE FRATERNITY WOULD LIKE TO WISH ALL BRAVE PILOTS MAKING THE JOURNEY TO COLONIA A SAFE AND PLEASENT JOURNEY

The Edge Fraternity is a French player group who were granted a Colonia visa, the beacons appeared in the home systems of other francophone player groups as an easter egg after their leader Duita Rider visited Frontier Developments in Cambridge.
