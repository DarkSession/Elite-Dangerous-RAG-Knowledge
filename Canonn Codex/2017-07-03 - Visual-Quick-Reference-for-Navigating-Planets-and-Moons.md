## Visual Quick Reference for Navigating Planets and Moons

Content: Very useful chart, for those who go hunting on planets, this is a good little reference for traversing Lat/Long on planets.

Cmdr *Duke Maximilien Robespierre* points out in the Reddit source post linked below:

> If your heading is 0 degrees, you will increase the latitude reading but longitude will stay the same. If the heading is 90 degrees, the latitude reading will not change but longitude will increase.

> So, say you want to reach lat: 150, long: 50, and you’re at 150, 55. You just keep heading at 270 degrees (because longitude decreases) until you reach 150, 50. Did that make sense?
