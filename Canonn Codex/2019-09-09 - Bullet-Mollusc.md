## Bullet Mollusc

Published: 09 Sep 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/bullet-mollusc/)

Content: There are several varieties of Bullet Molluscs to be found around the galaxy – notably in the Outer Orion sector. They appear inside Notable Stellar Phenomena. Look for the largest concentration of signals inside the phenomena and you should find them (if they are present) though they are smaller than the non-organic items and can be hard to spot.

In-game codex information shows that the different variants appear near different planet types, and have different requirements for Star Types – more can be found in the game codex.

Space lifeforms often have discoverable traits – scan them with the Composition Scanner when they are doing something to reveal the traits. For Bullet Molluscs these are the traits:

- Attracted to ship shields and drains them when in proximity
- Retreats when attacked
- Moves without apparent purpose

An additional trait that is not recorded by the composition scanner has been seen in the Lividium Bullet Mollusc which stops moving when illuminated and turns its tentacles towards the ship.

The following table lists the known varieties of Bullet Mollusc with observed traits. 

| Entryid | Species | Traits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2300401 | Cereum Bullet Mollusc | Attracted to ship shields and drains them when in proximity<br>Retreats when attacked |
| 2300402 | Lividum Bullet Mollusc | Retreats when attacked<br>Moves without apparent purpose<br>Stops moving when illuminated and turns tentacles towards the ship |
| 2300403 | Viride Bullet Mollusc | Attracted to ship shields and drains them when in proximity<br>Retreats when attacked |
| 2300406 | Rubeum Bullet Mollusc | Attracted to ship shields and drains them when in proximity<br>Retreats when attacked |
| 2300407 | Flavum Bullet Mollusc | Retreats when attacked<br>Moves without apparent purpose<br>Stops moving when illuminated and turns tentacles towards the ship |

Data gathered from the composition scanner by [software installed on Canonn ships](https://github.com/canonn-science/EDMC-Canonn/releases/latest "EDMC-Canonn Plugin Module") indicates that there may be at least two additional species that have not yet been discovered.
