The Ghost Giraffe has [video instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk2X0W1FrcQ) for locating it, with [reference star charts](http://imgur.com/a/Kq64T) for precise location.

Voyager 2 broadcasts audio greetings in multiple dialects which your ship’s sensors can receive when you target it, and the probe itself carries the famous Voyager Plaque.
