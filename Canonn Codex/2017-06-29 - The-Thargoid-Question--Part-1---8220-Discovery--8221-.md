Content: As many of you saw in the live stream the last 72 hours have been quite dense with information, discoveries and surprises concerning the recent alien finds. From the distress signals and crash sites that led us to the first site, to the square peg and round hole method of xeno-centric reverse engineering – these have been interesting times. To condense everything we have found would be a disservice to you fellow commanders as well as to the unnamed pilots – Canonn and otherwise – who have tirelessly toiled in the first 12 hours to find the all 5 sites and beyond.  That is why CFN will throughout the next few days be releasing a series of episodes called The Thargoid Question…
