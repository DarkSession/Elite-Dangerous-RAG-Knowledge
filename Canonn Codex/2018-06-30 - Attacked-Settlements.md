## Attacked Settlements

Published: 30 Jun 2018 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/attacked-settlements/)

Content: In late June 3304 a series of surface settlements that had been attacked by Thargoids were discovered. Listening Posts, in groups of three, were found in systems within the Pleiades, often within inhabited systems. These listening posts gave distances to the settlement systems, as well as planet, latitude, longitude which allowed the settlements to be located.

The settlements themselves have logs recording what happened at each site, including audio recordings. They sometimes also contain a data point that adds a navigation point so the site can be revisited (scanning the message logs also provide a way-point). The sites have a green glow around them, presumably the aftermath of the attack. Several messages talk about temperature drops and abduction by aliens. There have been reports of Thargoids revisiting the sites to perform further attacks, or to just scan the sites â€“ this seems to vary depending on the site.

A crashed Anaconda (â€˜[Bug Killer](https://canonn.science/codex/bug-killer-crashed-anaconda/)â€˜) was found around the same time, and seems related to the events that happened in the settlements.

Settlements were initially found by Annabella Terra, Bagofholding, DaftMav, Kaz Archer, Namix and Node\_ â€“ and probably others ðŸ˜‰
