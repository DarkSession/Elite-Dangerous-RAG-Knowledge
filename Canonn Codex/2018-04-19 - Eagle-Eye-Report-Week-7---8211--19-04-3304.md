Subject: Eagle Eye Report Week 7 - 19/04/3304

Eagle Eye Report as follows:
HIP 16704 - Decoded to show targets Jemetani & Esuvit Systems
HIP 16440 - Decoded to show targets Chan Mina & Deriv-Dar Systems
Pleiades Sector IR-W D!-76 - Decoded to show targets Nankul & LP 581-69 Systems
NHSS have only shown up in LP 581-36 and Deriv-Dar at the time of this report. The AEGIS vessel Acropolis is present in the Jemetani System whilst the Vanguard is holding station in the Esuvit System.
We believe the Thargoids may be running counter-intelligence. Intelligence gathering is ongoing at this time.
