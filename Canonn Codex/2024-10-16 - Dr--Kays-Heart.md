This Unregistered Comms Beacon was added in October 3307, when Dr. Kay Ross left Frontier.

Additionally, Dr. Kay’s voice can be heard in the background station announcements at “The Tavern” station, in the 59 Virginis system.

59 Virginis is the home system of Alchemy Den Player faction, and Dr. Kay *“Did the lines as an incentive on a charity stream that the leader ran”*.

Dr. Kay’s voice was added to the station with Update 11, on the 15th March 3308.
