Content: A Collionson Class Asteroid Ship was last reported in orbit of the planet Hope, in the Gateway system; however the location of this ship is now unknown.

Your ship’s navigation system will misspell Collionson as “Collinson” when it detects the signal source within 1,000 Ls of it, however your ship’s targeting system will spell it correctly once you drop out of supercruise.
