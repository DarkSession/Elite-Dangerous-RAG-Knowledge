*Extremely hardy photosynthetic organisms that thrive in arid environments. Thick, waxy leaf structures protect them from extreme surroundings, when gaseous exchange becomes unfavourable. The leaves can completely shut off the organism from the atmosphere causing a state of hibernation. The pointed leaves create precipitation slopes, which draw liquids to the heart of the organism. Here they are absorbed through a series of specialised cells and stored in the root structure until needed.*

*Aleoida of the Arcus and Gravis Species seem to favour flat or slightly lumpy terrain, whereas their fellow Species can populate hilly for Coronamus and Laminiae to almost mountainous terrain for Spica.*
