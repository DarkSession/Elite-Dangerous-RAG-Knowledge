## Gourd Molluscs

Published: 02 Jan 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/gourd-molluscs/)

Content: There are several varieties of Gourd Molluscs to be found around the galaxy. They appear inside Notable Stellar Phenomena. They are quite small and so can be difficult to find, look for the largest concentration of signals inside the phenomena and you should find them (if they are present). They appear to have basic movement skills and can sense their surroundings, as can be seem in the way they repeatedly approach nearby ships.

In-game codex information shows that the different variants appear near different planet types, and have different requirements for Star Types – more can be found in the game codex.

Gourd Molluscs have two discoverable traits – scan them with the Composition Scanner to reveal the traits. For Croceus Gourd Molluscs these are the traits:

- Retreats when attacked – shoot the mollusc and scan
- Moves towards ship if approached – scan the mollusc on approach

You do not appear to be able to take samples from Gourd Molluscs with Research Limpets.
