Published: 03 Jul 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/resources/planetary-bearing-calculator/)

Content: This excellent tool, courtesy of Cmdr Drygin who is working with the Canonn R&D team, allows you to easily find a set of coordinates on a planetary body from any starting point. Basic usage is as follows:

1. *Approach planet until you reach Orbital Cruise.*
2. *Stop ship completely (normal space).*
3. *Enter current and destination coordinates.*
4. *Align ship compass with given bearing.*
5. *Jump back into Supercruise and proceed to destination.*
