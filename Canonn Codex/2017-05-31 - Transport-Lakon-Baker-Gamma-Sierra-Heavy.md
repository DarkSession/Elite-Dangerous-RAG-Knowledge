This appeared to be in an ancient computer programming language called “Brainfuck,” when the program was executed, it returned the following message:

> 
> Thoth 1a

A Listening Post can be found in orbit of Thoth 1 a in a signal source entitled “Distress Beacon”.

This reveals the location of a crashed ship on the moon below.

When the ship’s Data Core is scanned, the following message is received:

> 
> **TRANSPORT LAKON BAKER GAMMA SIERRA HEAVY**
> 
> Committed cargo manifest:
> 
> 10 units – Heavy Metals
> 
> 419 units – Historical Novels (Secrets of Simulating Backgrounds)
> 
> 7 units – Liquor
> 
> 11 units – Explosives
> 
> 
> +++ Cargo bay temperature critical +++
> 
> +++ Fire suppressant systems not responding +++

No further meaning has yet been ascribed to the numbers in the message; there may not be one.
