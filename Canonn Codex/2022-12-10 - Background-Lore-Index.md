## Background Lore Index

Published: 10 Dec 2022 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/background-lore-index/)

Content: ## 

In the galaxy of Elite Dangerous there are the [Galnet News](https://community.elitedangerous.com/) posts that give us insight into the world around us. In addition to the main story played out in front of us via those articles, Elite Dangerous has a rich background story that pilots can stumble across through various methods including trilateration through [listening posts](https://canonn.science/codex/listening-posts/) or just stumbling over them. 

Canonn has collected as many of these background stories as possible but if we have missed any people let us know via our [Discord](https://canonn.science/how-to-join/) and we’ll be happy to expand on this page.

## Ancient Probes

These ancient probes were launched by humanity long ago, becoming our first interstellar space craft. Today they remind us of our humble beginnings.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| New Horizons | Humanity’s first mission to the dwarf planet Pluto. When this spacecraft launched, Pluto was still a full fledged planet |
| [Voyager 1](https://canonn.science/codex/voyager-1/) | Long ago, this was NASA’s longest lived mission and was humanity’s first spacecraft to leave the solar system |
| [Voyager 2](https://canonn.science/codex/voyager-2/) | This little probe was the first to directly measure the density and temperature of the interstellar plasma |

## Tourist Beacons

![Tourist Beacon: First Thargoid Contact - Lave](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TouristBeacon-1024x576.png)

Tourist and Visitor Beacons can be discovered all across the galaxy, but they mostly found within the human inhabited bubble. These beacons tell the stories of commanders, some no longer with us, as well as the history and lore of the Elite Dangerous universe, and mark beautiful sites to visit.

Due to the number of beacons they will not be listed below, instead, please visit our [Tourist and Visitor Beacons](https://canonn.science/codex/tourist-and-visitor-beacons/) article. Image Credit: CMDR iMetal

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |

Generation Ships are a particular class of Megaship, launched in the days before true FTL travel. They traversed the space between the stars at subluminal speeds, while their inhabitants were born, lived, procreated, and died onboard.

## Installations

![Istanu Unauthorized Installation in Istanu](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/HighRes_Istanu1_f_2022-12-11_19-57-54-1024x576.png)

Installations are orbital structures with various purposes and unlike starports and outposts they lack docking facilities. While some offer scenario missions or a location to use a hatch breaker limpet to obtain more cargo there are some that expand on the lore of Elite Dangerous. 

Unfortunately, after EDDB.io shut down, the installation list I was using was no longer available. We’ve been attempting to get the data back and thanks to CMDR Column01 in the Canonn Discord, we have the below json file of all installations reported to EDDN to date (2024.02.06). We hope you find this useful. Image Credit: CMDR Chewcat1.

## Megaships

There are a whole plethora of megaships in the Elite Dangerous. While the generation ship type of megaship is broken out separately, there are several different classes of “standard” megaship as detailed [here](https://canonn.science/codex/megaships/). Most of them are non-dockable as shown [here](https://canonn.science/codex/non-dockable-megaships-an-introduction/) but some, like the [rescue megaships](https://canonn.science/codex/rescue-megaships/) are.

In the vastness of space there is no shortage of crashed and abandoned ships, not all of them human. Note that these are persistent ship crashes. These stay across instances and time.

While not as common as crashed ships, there are a few wrecked SRVs laying around on various planets and moons. Note that these are persistent wrecked SRVs. These stay across instances and time. It is possible to find wrecked SRVs that are not persistent out in the black but since they are not constant they are not listed here.

## Unknown

![](https://canonn.science/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Raxxla_OrIsIt.jpg)

Not every mystery is yet solved, if it even can be.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Alvin Deefer](https://canonn.science/codex/unsolved-alvin-deefer/) | This mystery of Alvin Defeer and the Shady Lady has not been solved |
| [Caucuma Unregistered Comms Beacon](https://canonn.science/codex/caucuma-unregistered-comms-beacon/ "https://canonn.science/codex/caucuma-unregistered-comms-beacon/") | There was no found accompanying article that uses this decryption key |
| Cobra Signal | Some commanders have reported hearing an intermittent sound in the cockpits of ships and SRVs that, when viewed through a spectrogram, displays a shape reminiscent of a Cobra Mk3. Nothing conclusive has been found but it is being looked into as seen on the [Canonn Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1019569223174983820/1166054660373749771). |
| [Collionson Class Asteroid Ship](https://canonn.science/codex/collionson-class-asteroid-ship/) | This asteroid ship is missing, do you know where it went? |
| Dredgers | There are four known Dredger clans, each operating a Dredger megaship. The [Scriveners Clan](https://canonn.science/codex/the-scriveners/), [Blue Viper Club Clan](https://elite-dangerous.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Viper_Club_Clan_Dredger) and [Artificers Clan](https://canonn.science/codex/the-artificers-clan/) have been interacted with as part of the story but the Dredgers of the [Phagos Clan](https://canonn.science/codex/the-phagos-clan/) were only ever seen in the Elite: Dangerous Horizon’s Beta. That said, where are they now? |
| Numbers Stations | The antennas of some stations (and even those without antennas) appear to be admitting a sound that, when viewed through the spectrogram, and display any and all letters and numbers 0 through 9. It is unknown what these could possibly mean as they have been viewed to not repeat and be different for two commanders in the same instance. It is being looked into by multiple entities but for Canonn’s part it can be found on the [Canonn Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1019569223174983820/1192725291177611345). |
| Patreus Days | It has been found that many, if not all, installations in the bubble emit a signal that, when viewed through a spectrogram, clearly spell out “SENATOR PATREUS YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED”. The signal is being looked at by others but brought to Canonn’s attension when the antennas on Fleet Carriers were found to display the second half of the signal (“(A)YS ARE NUMBERED”). It is unknown if this is a new signal or an old signal that was missed. For Canonn’s part, it can be found on the [Canonn Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1019569223174983820/1194176728269082715). |
| [Raxxla](https://canonn.science/lore/drewwagar-raxxla/) | Likely the greatest mystery in the entirety of Elite’s history, first appearing in the book *The Alien World: A Complete Illustrated Guide* (1980) and then in the novella, *The Dark Wheel*, packaged with the original Elite game (1984). |
