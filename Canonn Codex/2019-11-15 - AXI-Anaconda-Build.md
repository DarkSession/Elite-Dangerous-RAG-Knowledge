## AXI Anaconda Build

Published: 15 Nov 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/lab69xia/axi-anaconda-build-2/)

Content: Much like in other applications, the Anaconda is generally an all-around good AX ship, though not quite as effective as the Federal Corvette and Imperial Cutter.  With patience and skill, this build can hold its own against virtually any Interceptor variant.

Please note the Shield Generator can be swapped for a Prismatic Shield Generator. You can replace shield boosters with a shutdown field neutralizer or xeno scanner. A xeno scanner is functionally a waste of slot in solo fights, but it is advisable to have at least one person bring a scanner in wings.

**Note that power priorities should be set accordingly to your specific chosen module configuration**
