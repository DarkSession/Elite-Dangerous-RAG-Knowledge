Content: A crashed Thargoid Scout can be found on Pleiades Sector LN-T c3-4 body 2 a, located at -60.2105, 41.1846 (in Live/4.0) or at -60.8799, 42.5728 (in Legacy/3.8).

The crash site is surrounded by Thargoid Technology Samples, Thargoid Biological Matter, and Thargoid Resin.

There is a data point to target with your SRV’s data link scanner, this will give you a waypoint that makes further visits easier, and returns a ship analysis:

>

This is the second crashed Thargoid Scout found, unlike the [previous crash](https://canonn.science/codex/crashed-thargoid-scout/) this one appears to have crashed ‘side-on’. A [third crashed Thargoid Scout](https://canonn.science/codex/xenotechnology/crashed-scout-3/) has since been found.
