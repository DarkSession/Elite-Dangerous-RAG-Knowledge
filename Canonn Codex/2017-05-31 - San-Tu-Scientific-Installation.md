## San Tu Scientific Installation

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/san-tu-scientific-installation/)

Content: A Scientific Installation can be found in the San Tu system, orbiting body 4 c. 

Use caution when dropping out of supercruise, you will often immediately collide with the structure. Full shields are recommended.

Nearby the installation at approximate 28.5 km’s, there is an Unregistered Comms Beacon that is known to transmit the following every hour, on the hour:

> SA HMCSD HMCCD HMCCD HMCCDM1 HMCCD HMCN SF MR HMC HMCW
> IGCH UACG
> LOC A4A
> LA NEG 34
> LO NEG 141
> (repeated four times)

This transmission continues the [Sol/Achenar/Gateway Numbers Beacons](https://canonn.science/codex/solachenargateway-numbers-beacon-mystery/) mystery.

- The initial sequence of numbers decodes to the word INTRUDE by letter positions.
- The next two words can be decoded with this key using a Keyed Caesar cipher, giving “SECURE PLSIADES” (PLEIADES). Note that you actually need to select to **encode**  the data with the keyword
- The sequence beginning “SA” thru “HMCW” is decoded to describe a system with the following bodies:
- SA: Class A Star;
    - HMCSD: High Metal Content world, Sulphur Dioxide atmosphere;
    - HMCCD: High Metal Content world, Carbon Dioxide atmosphere;
    - HMCCDM1: High Metal Content world, Carbon Dioxide atmosphere, 1 Moon;
    - HMCCD: High Metal Content world, Carbon Dioxide atmosphere;
    - HMCN: High Metal Content world, Nitrogen atmosphere;
    - SF: Class F Star;
    - MR: Metallic Ring;
    - HMC: High Metal Content world, no atmosphere;
    - HMCW: High Metal Content world, Water atmosphere.
- The two words prior to “LOC” can also be decoded with the same initial key and cipher, giving “BETA SITE”.
- The remaining lines specify the body and location: A 4 a -34,-141.
