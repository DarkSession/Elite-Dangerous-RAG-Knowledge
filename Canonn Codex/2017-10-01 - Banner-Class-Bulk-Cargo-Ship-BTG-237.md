Content: The [Banner Class Bulk Cargo Ship](https://canonn.science/codex/banner-class-bulk-cargo-ship/) BTG-237 was last reported in orbit of the moon Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 5 a.

The ship is heavily damaged, destroyed by weapons consistent with other Thargoid attacks, leaving green hull scarring and some kind of green gas throughout the area.

A Ship Log Uplink point can be located in a fragment of the hull. Deploy your ship’s hardpoints and use the onboard Data Link Scanner within 200m of the post to scan it and retrieve the log:

Medical and Emergency Aid ships are in the area, rescuing the survivors.

A number of Engineer Materials and Cargo Canisters are scattered nearby.
