## Alcatraz-class Reformatory

Published: 14 Oct 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/alcatraz-class-prison-ship/)

Content: The Alcatraz-class Reformatory is a class of Prison Ship.

The class consists of a very large number of cell block modules; two are mounted at the front along the direction of the ship’s axis, with the third in the center of the axis set back. Two long power conduits run between them. A command module is on the top of the third cell block, mounted perpendicular to the ship’s direction of travel.

Each of those two cell block modules mounted at the front have two Cargo Hatches, with a fifth being on the third, below the more central command module. The pair of Cargo Hatches on the cell block modules is defended by two Turrets, as well as the single Cargo Hatch below the command module.

Its default Cargo of around 730 tons is Legal Drugs, Machinery, Medicines, Personal Effects, Waste and Weapons.

A further three cell block modules are mounted together behind the others, also perpendicular to the ship’s direction of travel, backed by two two-engine drive modules. At the rear of the ship is a large seven-engine drive module, on which a Hackable Data Transmitter can be found.

The Ship Log Uplink is generally mounted on the front of the central of the forward three cell blocks.
