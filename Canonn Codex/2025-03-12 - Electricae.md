*Organisms found exclusively on extremely cold ice worlds in the vicinity of frozen lakes. The visible tips can be observed protruding from the ice, often near fissures where it is thinnest. The bulk of the organisms extend down through the ice into subsurface melt potentially for several kilometres. Electricae are superconductive in nature. utilising the thermal circulation of the surrounding fluid to drive an electrochemical process. This is probably why they are limited to planets with atmospheres dominated by noble gases. The surface structure exists to provide a connection to the atmosphere, which in turn creates a point of electrical potential difference. A by-product of this is the bioluminescent display that runs through the organism. Although never witnessed, reproduction presumably occurs below the surface by some unidentified process.*

*A Species of Electricae that extends a tip of four connected loops above the ice, each covered with brightly luminous fronds. This Species is most typically found on planets or their moons in systems containing Stellar Classes: A, White Dwarf or Neutron.*
