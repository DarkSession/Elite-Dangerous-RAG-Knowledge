Content: The amazing Canonn R&D team bring you another tool to assist while investigating the mysteries of the Thargoids.  This time to help in visualising, checking off and sharing the various Thargoid Glyph combinations seen on Thargoid vessels.

Select the Inner Ring component, and then choose the corresponding Outer Ring component to step through all the various combinations until you get the mix you want.

Copy from the Image field to paste a direct link to the chosen combination wherever you want to refer to and display that glyph combination, on the forums or in a Discord chat.

This tool will continue to be extended and further information added as more analysis becomes available.
