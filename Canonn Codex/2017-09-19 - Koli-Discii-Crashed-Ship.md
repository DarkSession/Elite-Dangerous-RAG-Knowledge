## Koli Discii Crashed Ship

Published: 19 Sep 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/koli-discii-crashed-ship/)

Content: This Crashed Ship is a crashed Anaconda that has crashed in the Koli Discii system on body C 6 a, at 28.5743, 7.2182 (in Live/4.0 and Legacy/3.8).

The location of this site can be found by following the three nearby listening posts located in:
Chipi / Waikiri / Batar

Note: In 4.0 these Listening Posts currently give the location to [Gregorys Rest](https://canonn.science/codex/gregorys-rest/) instead of the Crashed Ship.

The abandoned settlement [Gregorys Rest](https://canonn.science/codex/gregorys-rest/) is 2km away on a bearing of 250º (in Legacy/3.8, however it is 3.70Mm’s away in Live/4.0).

From the contents of the wreckage, which includes Brewer Corp and Caine Massey crates as well as a number of cargo canisters:

- Bertrandite (5x).
- Beryllium (2x).
- Gold (1x).
- Palladium (4x).

The wreckage includes three Cargo Racks that can be scanned, but give no information or data, and shot which gives rare Engineer Materials.

Within the crashed ship itself a Ship Data Core can be scanned for an Intel Package.

Note: In 3.8 the latitude and longitude appear to be inverted, the star “C” is missing from the appropriate message, additionally, the crash site is a Faulcon DeLacy Anaconda, not a Lakon Type-9 Heavy.

The listening post identifiers can be interpreted as a series of hexadecimal pairs:

> 
> 57 61 69 6b 69 72 69
> 
> 42 61 74 61 72

When interpreted as ASCII, this yields the system names:

The new listening post identifier given in this message, as with the last, can be interpreted as a series of hexadecimal pairs:

> 
> 43 68 69 70 69

When interpreted as ASCII, yield the system name where the first beacon can be found:

As expected, the identifiers in this listening post match those already given by the other two.
