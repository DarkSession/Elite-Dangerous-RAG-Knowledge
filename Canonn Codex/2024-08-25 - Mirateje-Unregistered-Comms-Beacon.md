## Mirateje Unregistered Comms Beacon

Published: 25 Aug 2024 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/mirateje-unregistered-comms-beacon/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Mirateje system, orbiting body A 6. 

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be on the hour, every 4 hours, with transmissions reported at: 00:00 / 04:00 / 08:00 / 12:00 / 16:00 / 20:00. 

The transmitted message is the following:

* * *

> 
> 19 3 1 14 20 8 5 13
> (repeated four times)

* * *

Decodes by letter positions to:

> 
> SCANTHEM

Unfortunately, the related Herald is missing, so we are unable to find and confirm the target location.

A “Convoy Beacon” POI can be found in the Mirateje system, orbiting the A 1. The “Convoy Beacon” contains multiple System Defence Force ships, escorting a faction-less Type 9 named “PRINCIPAL HAULER” . 

The Type 9 will usually be carrying Performance Enhancers, Progenitor Cells, and Occupied Escape Pods.

Since the “Convoy Beacon” signal source is within the Mirateje system, this may well be the correct target for this Unregistered Comms Beacon. However, without the corresponding Herald to decode, this is impossible to confirm.
