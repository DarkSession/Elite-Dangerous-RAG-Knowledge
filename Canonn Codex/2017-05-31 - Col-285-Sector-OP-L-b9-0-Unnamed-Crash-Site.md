An audible mayday call can be heard on arrival at the site:

> 
> Mayday, Mayday, we’ve survived a crash and need help. We’re stranded and our supplies are running low. I’m including coordinates with this transmission.

No co-ordinates are given in the audible call, it is to be assumed that this is the audible component of the signal picked up by the listening posts that included the co-ordinates followed to find this site.

At the crash site there are is a Settlement Comms Log Uplink, scanning it does not give any additional background. The Listening Posts refer to the corporation.

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground, and a Damaged Escape Pod which can be retrieved. Nothing has been found to occur when the Damaged Escaped Pod is scooped or delivered.
