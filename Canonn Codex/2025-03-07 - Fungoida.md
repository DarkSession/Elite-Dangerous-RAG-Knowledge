*Organisms that live deep inside a planetary substrate. They share similar morphology to fungi but are not saprophytic, instead their mycelial body drives its metabolism through chemosynthetic and thermosynthetic processes. These are facilitated by the substrate which also protects the organism from environmental extremes. The exposed aspects of the organisms are primarily involved in reproduction. This is frequently through spore ejection, but certain Species also support gaseous exchange with the atmosphere. Some Fungoida exhibit bioluminescent behaviours as part of a metabolic process involved in the breakdown of accumulated toxins.*

*Fungoida frequently exhibit a preference for mountainous areas of a planetary body, on plateaued spaces within mountain ranges or on the mountain sides and peaks themselves, presenting Commanders with interesting challenges to landing in close proximity.*

*A Fungoida that features clusters of mottled bubble-shaped growths atop a central stalk. These contain spores that can be exposed to the winds to facilitate distribution.*

*This Fungoida Species resembles an upturned jellyfish, emerging from a solid base buried within the substrate. The exposed part is dominated by fleshy reproductive organisms that shed organic tissue. This tissue can float on the light breeze and form a new organism if it lands in the right location.*
