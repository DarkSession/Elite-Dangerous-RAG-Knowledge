Content: The Samson-class Hauler is a class of Bulk Cargo Ship.

The class consists of long central superstructure with a command module on the front, drive module on the back, and two cargo pods mounted along the structure in a butterfly formation.

On the wingsides away from the central axis there are two Cargo Bays each.

Its default Cargo of around 600 tons is Industrial Materials, Machinery, Metals, and Minerals.

Closer to central Axis there are two Automated Defense Turretts defending the opposites cargo pods Cargo Bays.

The Ship Log Uplink and a Hackable Comms Array are generally mounted on top of the drive module.

A Samson-class Hauler with call-sign HAI-465 can be found for reference at the following waypoints: Haidjaram, Evnike, Kumata, 40 Draconis, Kumata, HIP 95044.

- Number of Turrets: 4
- Hackable Comms Array: 1
- Cargo Bays: 4
- Total Cargo: ~600t
- Default Cargo: *Industrial Materials* (Micro-Weave Cooling Hoses, Semiconductors, Superconductors), *Machinery* (Building Fabricators, Energy Grid Assembly, Geological Equipment, Mineral Extractors, Power Generators), *Metals* (Beryllium, Copper, Gallium, Gold, Indium, Lithium, Osmium, Palladium, Silver, Titanium), *Minerals* (Bauxite, Bromellite, Cryolite, Goslarite, Lepidolite, Pyrophyllite, Uraninite)
- Rare Commodity Sub-Types: Chemicals, Metals, Technology
