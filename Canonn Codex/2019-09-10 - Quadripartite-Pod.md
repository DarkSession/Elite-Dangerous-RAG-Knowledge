## Quadripartite Pod

Published: 10 Sep 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/quadripartite-pod/)

Content: There are several varieties of Quadripartite Pod to be found around the galaxy – notably in the Lyra’s Song sector. They appear inside Notable Stellar Phenomena. They, the [Chalice Pod](https://canonn.science/codex/chalice-pod/) and [Rhizome Pod](https://canonn.science/codex/rhizome-pod/) are the only Pods to have no known ‘Tree’ associated (though Rhizome Pods are stated in-game to not have trees).  

In-game codex information shows that the different variants appear near different planet types, and have different requirements for Star Types – more can be found in the game codex.

Space lifeforms often have discoverable traits – scan them with the Composition Scanner when they are doing something to reveal the traits. For Quadripartite Pods these are the traits:

- Turns towards nearest star.
- Turns towards ship if approached.

They can be sampled using Research Limpets and have returned Pod Core Tissue, Pod Dead Tissue, and Pod Surface Tissue.
