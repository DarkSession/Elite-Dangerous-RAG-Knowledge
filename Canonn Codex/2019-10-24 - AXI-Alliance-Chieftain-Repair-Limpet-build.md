## AXI Alliance Chieftain Repair Limpet build

Published: 24 Oct 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/lab69xia/axi-alliance-chieftain-repair-limpet-build/)

Content: Slightly faster than Krait MK II, and extremely maneuverable.  Powerful thrusters allow for orbiting without boost.  Can use additional C5 GSRP instead of HRP by powering down the AFMU and using a regular MRP instead of GMRP.  Has plenty of speed, but can trade a bit of armor to use Lightweight Composite hull if needed.  Variant that sacrifices some hull for ability to repair. Slightly slower due to using Military-Grade Composite hull.
