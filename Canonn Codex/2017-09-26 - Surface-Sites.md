## Surface Sites

Published: 26 Sep 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/surface-sites/)

Content: With the exception of registered Settlements, the majority of Surface Sites cannot be found using your ship’s systems. You must obtain the body name and co-ordinates from another source, such as a [Listening Post](https://canonn.science/codex/listening-posts/), or [Unregistered Comms Beacon](https://canonn.science/codex/unregistered-comms-beacons/).

What can be found has a variety ranging from a simple crashed ship with cargo canisters to scoop and sell, to full abandoned settlements with Data Points and Comms Log Uplinks that can be scanned for the story of what happened.
