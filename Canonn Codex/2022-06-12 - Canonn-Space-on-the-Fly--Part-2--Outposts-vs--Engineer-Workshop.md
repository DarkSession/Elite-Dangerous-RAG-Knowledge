Published: 12 Jun 2022 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/faction-bgs/canonn-space-on-the-fly-part-2-outposts-vs-engineer-workshop/)

Content: **2.1 HIP 114099**

- *Megaships: WP 2 + 6*
- *Tourist Installation*
- *Economy: Military*
- *Surface Port*

HIP 114099 was the first system with RES in reasonable distance Canonn controlled, so it was used extensively in the plan to expand Canonn to the engineer system of Khun.

HIP 114099 has also a pristine metallic ring for mining: 4 A Ring.

**2.1.1 WP 2 + 6: Megaships**

During Waypoint 2 there is a [Riker-class Reformatory](https://canonn.science/codex/riker-class-prison-ship/) Megaship close to entry; during Waypoint 6 a [Bellmarsh-class Reformatory](https://canonn.science/codex/bellmarsh-class-prison-ship/). 

**2.1.2 HIP 114099 Centennial Hippodrome:  Tourist Installation (1 – 6,25 ls)**

There is a [Tourist Installation](https://canonn.science/tag/tourist-installation/) HIP 114099 Centennial Hippodrome very close to entry.  At the time of writing it’s controlled by the local pirate faction, so watch out for scans.

**2.1.3 Davy Survey: Surface Port (e 2, 1812 ls)**

**2.1.4 Economy: Military**

Davy Survey is a quite typical Surface Port dotted around a large tower. It is a Military Economy, selling all types of legal weapons and regularly having combat missions on the board. We’ll buy Non-lethal Weapons and Reactive Armour to export.

- sell Onionhead Gamma Strain
- buy Non-Lethal Weapons and Reactive Armour
- jump 47,85 ly to Halbarapii

**2.2. Halbarapii**

- *Medical Installation*
- *Megaships: WP 1-4*

**2.2.1 Hidden Forest Community Hospital: Medical Installation (1 – 8,02 ls)**

We are here for the [Medical Installation](https://canonn.science/tag/medical-installation/)close to entry.

**2.2.2 WP 1-4: Megaships**

During WP 1-2 there is a [Dionysus-class Cropper](https://canonn.science/codex/dionysus-class-agricultural-vessel/) in system. WP 3 has the rare chance to see a massive [Amaethon-class Cropper](https://canonn.science/codex/amaethon-class-cropper/)in Canonn Space. WP 4 there is [Hogan-class Hauler](https://canonn.science/codex/hogan-class-bulk-cargo-ship/) to visit.

- jump 18,86 ly to Machadan

**2.3. Machadan**

- *Megaships: WP 3 +5*
- *Raw Material Trader*

**2.3.1 WP 3 +5: Megaships**

During Waypoints 3 and 5 there is a [Sagan-class Traveller](https://canonn.science/tag/sagan-class-2/)to visit.

**2.3.2 Bernoulli City: Raw Material Trader (3 – 1768,66 ls)**

While Bernoulli City Commodity Market is mostly industrial, its secondary economy is refinery – but the only metal refined here is Indium. Still this takes precedence in case of the Material Trader, which isn’t trading manufactured Materials in this case, but in Raw Materials – 1 of 2 of those in Canonn Space. We’ll sell all we carry and buy some Indium.

- Sell Non-lethal Weapons and Reactive Armour
- Buy Indium
- Jump 22,87 ly to Khun

**2.4. Khun**

- *Engineer Workshop*
- *Megaships: WP 2-4 + 6*

**2.4.1 Long Sight Base: Engineer Workshop (5 – 60,55 ls)**

Canonn was the first Player Groups Minor Faction taking control of an Engineer System – [on September 30 2017](https://canonn.science/news/canonn-expands-into-khun/). It was the culmination of the second phase of Canonn BGS. CMDR Patau82 and CMDR Dommarraa were crucial in working out Expansion Cube Calcluations with and for the interested public, and Patau82 created the plan of directed expansions leading from Varati to Khun. Many early Canoneers were involved to push the right systems into expansion and force a Retreat in Jarildekald to make it happen. Khun is by far the Canonn controlled system with most traffic, and you might want to disable Fleet carriers in your Navigation Panel before jumping in. You can buy the class-2 and -3 module Enhanced Performance Thrusters at Long Sight Base – perfect for racing with the smallest ships.

**2.4.2 WP 2-4 + 6: Megaships**

During Waypoint 2 there is a [Hercules-class Hauler](https://canonn.science/codex/hercules-class-bulk-cargo-ship/), Waypoint 3 and 4 have a [Bowman-class Researcher](https://canonn.science/codex/bowman-class-science-vessel/)and Waypoint 6 has a [Naphtha-class Tanker](https://canonn.science/codex/naphtha-class-tanker/)in system. Be aware that Khun is low security and due to high traffic always in some state, so those megaships are often attacked and you might end in the cross-fire.

- jump 17,55 ly to HIP 112970

**2.5. HIP 112970**

- *Commercial Outpost*
- *Megaships: WP 1,2 +5*

**2.5.1 Lee Holdings: Commercial Outpost (1 – 272,66)**

Lee Holdings is a Commercial Outpost. Through its glass roof you can see various ships on sale, including an Anaconda. We’ll sell the Indium, and buy Onionhead Gamma Strain.

- sell Indium
- buy Onionhead Gamma Strain

**2.5.2 WP 1, 2 + 5: Megaships**

During Waypoint 1 there is a [Hercules Hauler](https://canonn.science/codex/hercules-class-bulk-cargo-ship/)to visit. During Waypoint 2 a [Naphtha Class Tanker](https://canonn.science/codex/naphtha-class-tanker/). And during Waypoint 5 a [Banner-class Hauler](https://canonn.science/codex/banner-class-bulk-cargo-ship/).
