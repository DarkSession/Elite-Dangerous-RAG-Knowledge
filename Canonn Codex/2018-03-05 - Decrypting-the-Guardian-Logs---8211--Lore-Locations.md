## Decrypting the Guardian Logs &#8211; Lore Locations

Published: 05 Mar 2018 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/decrypting-the-guardian-logs-lore-locations/)

Content: This is a set of locations for the different [lore](https://canonn.science/codex/guardians-codex/) in the [Decrypting the Guardian Logs](https://canonn.science/codex/ram-tah-decrypting-the-guardian-logs/) mission. 

Combinations may also occur at other sites – but if a Lore entry requires (for instance) Orb + Relic then you can scan that at any instance of the *same site layout* for the same lore. 

There can be issues when scanning the obelisks such that you do not receive the inbox message – if this is the case it is worth checking that you got credited with the CR for the scan – if you did not get the CR then you will still need the scan – try rescanning, relogging or visiting a different site.
