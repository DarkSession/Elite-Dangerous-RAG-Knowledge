## Bulb Mollusc

Published: 09 Sep 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/bulb-mollusc/)

Content: There are several varieties of Bulb Molluscs to be found around the galaxy – notably in the Inner Orion-Perseus Conflux sector. They appear inside Notable Stellar Phenomena. Look for the largest concentration of signals inside the phenomena and you should find them (if they are present). 

In-game codex information shows that the different variants appear near different planet types, and have different requirements for Star Types – more can be found in the game codex.

Space lifeforms often have discoverable traits – scan them with the Composition Scanner when they are doing something to reveal the traits. For Bulb Molluscs these are the traits:

- Retreats if attacked
- Releases spores on when scanned or approached with / without lights

If you have Research Limpets you can sample the Molluscs and get Mollusc Brain Tissue, Soft Tissue and Fluid.
