## Thargoid Message

Published: 31 Jan 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/news/thargoid-message/)

Content: ### Thargoid Message

A new link **message** has been received from the **Thargoids** which some people have said is **connected** to the departure of **Ed Lewis**. Due to so many of our commanders suffering gin induced impairment we are appealing to the rest of the Galactic community for **help decoding** it.

The message has a number of **features** which are similar to normal Thargoid Link messages but instead of providing the location of a target system as we have seen in the past, this uses a **ternary encoding scheme** which has each letter encoded using three ternary bits, also known as **trits** or more amusingly as tits.

The preamble can be viewed in a **spectogram** to show a diagram of a **system**. The identity of that system may be the **key** to decoding the rest of the message.

Commander **LCU No Fool Like One** gave the following statement on Hutton Orbital Radio:

> 
> This is unprecedented. If this is not an elaborate hoax, then this is huge news. The first attempt of the Thargoids to communicate with us directly
