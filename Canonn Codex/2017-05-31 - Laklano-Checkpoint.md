## Laklano Checkpoint

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/laklano-checkpoint/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Laklano system, orbiting body 3 a. 

The transmission times of this beacon are believed to be on the hour, every 4 hours, with transmissions reported at: 00:00 / 04:00 / 08:00 / 12:00 / 16:00 / 20:00. 

The transmitted message is the following:

> 
> 3 18 25 8 1 22 15 11
> (repeated four times)

Decodes by letter positions to:

> 
> CRYHAVOK

This message is the decryption key for an encoded Galnet article in the local Herald:

The message consists of a series of words that can be interpreted as the NATO phonetic alphabet, yielding the message:

> 
> AGRJERN – SBGFGAEVNGRDEZEBJ – EI1 – QNPNVEBCADKAHSGNRV

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of CRYHAVOK taken from the beacon yielded the message:

> 
> CONDANI – PROVOCATIONHAZARD – AB1 – MILITARYCHECKPOINT

This leads to a “Checkpoint” signal source in the Condani system, orbiting body AB 1. This appears to be a permanent military checkpoint identical to the temporary ones seen in other systems during periods of War.

It contains four navigation beacons and a number of military ships associated with the local system authority.
