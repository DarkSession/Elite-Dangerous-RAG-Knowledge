## Hogan-class Hauler

Published: 14 Oct 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/hogan-class-bulk-cargo-ship/)

Content: The Hogan-class Hauler is a class of Bulk Cargo Ship.

The class consists of a command module on the front followed by two rotating habitat rings, the first a smaller inner-only ring, and the second a dual habitat ring.

Behind the habitat rings a small rake of six trusses holding three rows of tanks each runs along the central superstructure.

The Ship Log Uplink is generally mounted on the tank trusses immediately behind the habitat rings.

The tank trusses are followed by three cargo pods—one mounted along the central structure, and the other two mounted directly against it on either side. Those latter two have one engine each, and house one Cargo bay each on the long small side furthest away from the central axis, and one closest to central axis.

Its default Cargo of around 600 tons is Industrial Materials, Machinery, Metals, Minerals, and Technology.

4 Automated Defence Turrets are placed on those two Cargo Pods. Two of those Turrets on the broader sides and two on the smaller sides closer to the central axis.

The rear of the ship has two dual-engine drive modules.

Between the central cargo pod and the drive engine module there is a Hackable Comms Array on a small extra module.

A Hogan-class Hauler with call-sign ROS-770 can be found for reference at the following waypoints: ROSS 667, Aje, Vorden, Equagei, Vorden, Kabijao.

- Number of Turrets: 4
- Hackable Data Transmitters: 1
- Cargo Bays: 2
- Total Cargo: ~600t
- Default Cargo: *Industrial Materials* (Insulating Membrane, Neofabric Insulation, Semiconductors), *Machinery* (Atmospheric Processors, Building Fabricators, Energy Grid Assembly, Microbial Furnaces, Power Generators, Power Transfer Bus), *Metals* (Beryllium, Copper, Gallium, Gold, Indium, Lithium, Osmium, Palladium, Silver, Tantalum, Titanium), *Minerals* (Bauxite, Indite, Pyrophyllite, Uraninite), *Technology* (Aquaponic Systems, Auto-Fabricators, Bioreducing Lichen, Resonating Separators)
- Rare Commodity Sub-Types: Chemicals, Machinery, Metals, Technology
