Content: CFN brings a special report regarding an ***upcoming Community Goal*** later in May for Canonn Research with the goal of ***building a** **Megaship***.  The Council have revealed that dependant on CG success levels, the *Megaship* could have services such as outfitting, repair, restock, reload, mission board and possibly a Universal Cartographics office, though sadly no shipyard will be possible.
