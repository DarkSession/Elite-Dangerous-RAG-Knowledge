## Rescue Megaships

Content: Rescue Ships are a type of carrier megaship owned by local branches of the Pilot’s Federation to orbit damaged stations. Around the ship, search and rescue ships may be spotted. These ships are named for the station they orbit (i.e. Rescue Ship – The Oracle). Orbiting 2mm away from the stations they are assigned to, Rescue Ships offer missions to salvage from the damaged stations, a unique rescue commodities market, repairing and refueling, and outfitting geared towards rescue pilots (passenger cabins, collection limpets, and AFMS).

Once a station switched to Repairing the rescue ship will leave. Any modules or ships on the rescue ship will move back to the station under repair.

Lastly but not least, Rescue Ships also act as the destination for the refugees from damaged stations.
