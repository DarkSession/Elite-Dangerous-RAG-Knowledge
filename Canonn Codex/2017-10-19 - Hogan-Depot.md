## Hogan Depot

Published: 19 Oct 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/hogan-depot/)

Content: Hogan Depot is an abandoned settlement in the HIP 7158 system, on body A 2 b, at -34.4064, -43.2743 (in Live/4.0) or at -44.6301, -63.8019 (in Legacy/3.8).

The location of this facility was given in the logs found at [Mayes Chemical Plant](https://canonn.science/codex/mayes-chemical-plant/).

It was operated by the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm (INRA), a co-operative between the Federation and Empire that operated during the last war with the Thargoids. This facility appears to have had connections to the project that created the mycoid used against the Thargoids, operating as a transfer facility.

The facility contains a number of habitation modules, hangar or barracks buildings, and large tanks marked with the symbol for the mycoid weapon; the ground is stained in a manner consistent with leakage of the agent.

Within the facility there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

## Logs

Around the facility there are three Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives some of the history of the INRA:

* * *

> 
> **PESTICIDES? 1/3**
> …Bypassing security protocols…
> …Secure connection established…
> …Accessing communications log…
> 
> Every day the haulers come, dropping off more of the stuff. Others come to pick it up. We’ve been told not to ask questions. See, there’s rumours it’s some kind of pesticide, right. But with the amount we’ve got in storage, they must be expecting one hell of an outbreak.

> 
> **PESTICIDES? 2/3**
> …Bypassing security protocols…
> …Secure connection established…
> …Accessing communications log…
> 
> Some of the top brass from INRA’s visiting. The boss said he was here to talk about investment, but this guy had a military smell all over him. I know the public thinks that INRA is this great cooperative enterprise, but I don’t buy it. I think there’s more to them than meets the eye.
> 
> One thing’s for sure – they’re running the show here.

> 
> **PESTICIDES? 3/3**
> …Bypassing security protocols…
> …Secure connection established…
> …Accessing communications log…

> So, the inbound haulers have stopped coming, but the collection ships are still flying in. The place finally is being emptied.
> 
> I was talking to one of the hauler pilots down the docks today. According to her, this is all part of some kind of top-secret anti-Thargoid weapon thing. Apparently they’re flying the stuff to a med-research facility in LP 389-95 7, wherever that is. She reckons, this has been going on for months, at sites all over the galaxy.
> 
> So it’s not pesticide then – well, at least not in the conventional sense.
