## Bell Mollusc

Published: 09 Sep 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/bell-mollusc/)

Content: There are several varieties of Bell Molluscs to be found around the galaxy – notably in Temple and Norma Arm. They appear inside Notable Stellar Phenomena. Look for the largest concentration of signals inside the phenomena and you should find them (if they are present) as they are small relative to non-organic forms. 

In-game codex information shows that the different variants appear near different planet types, and have different requirements for Star Types – more can be found in the game codex.

Space lifeforms often have discoverable traits – scan them with the Composition Scanner when they are doing something to reveal the traits. For Bell Molluscs these traits may be found:

- Retreats if attacked
- Moves towards ship if scanned
