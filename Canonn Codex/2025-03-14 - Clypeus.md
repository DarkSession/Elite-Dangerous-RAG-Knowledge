*Extremophile organisms that have evolved to create hard shield structures, primarily to protect against stellar radiation. They also collect and condense traces of liquid material in the atmosphere, allowing the organisms to flourish in extremely arid environments. The shields are typically synthesised from surrounding inorganic material. which will frequently define their shape and colouration.*

*Other spawning requirements being met, Clypeus may be found inhabiting rock-strewn plains and low hillside terrain.*
