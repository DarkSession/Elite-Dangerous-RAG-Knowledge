*Low-lying photosynthetic organisms that bond tightly to the surface of rocks. The body of the organism may be embedded in the rock subsurface to provide protection from the elements, leaving the tough photosynthetic proto-leaves exposed. Their simple proto-evolutionary nature means that they are a common sight on rocky worlds. Colouration is driven by the absorption spectral of the nearby stellar body.* 

*The list of Variant Stellar Classes might suggest the hypothesis that Stratum favour mainly non-main sequence stars. However, those few main sequence classes that do have a recorded Stratum population – namely F, K and M – have the greater share, approximately 93%, of the recorded Genus population. However the relative rarity of stellar classes outside the main sequence vs. those within must be factored into any such evaluation.*

*Stratum mainly favour open, flattish terrain but some Species can also spawn on low-lying rocky outcrops.*

| Stratum Araneamus | 2.94% | 2,448,900 |
| Stratum Cucumisis | 3.88% | 16,202,800 |

| Stratum Paleas | 34.80% | 1,362,000 |
| Stratum Tectonicas | 41.35% | 19,010,800 |

**Note**

*The recorded data and consequently the percentage shown above for Stratum Tectonicas is likely misrepresentative of the actual population situation – more so than the general consideration re: relation of data recorded to the process of recording. Tectonicas is a very high value biological in respect of the Vista Genomics payout and its spawning characteristics are relatively common. Thus, Commanders wishing solely or primarily to make a rapid profit from Exobiology have pursued Tectonicas in preference to the other Stratum species, thus skewing the data.*

### Stratum Araneamus

*A Stratum Species that has a vaguely octopoid shape. The pale semi-translucent upper domes can reveal colourful inner organisms, which contrast with the darker outstretched tentacles. Surprisingly, only Araneamus’ Emerald Variant has ever been recorded. Araneamus is one of the rarer biologicals (only 0.3% of recorded biological population) and it may be that only the Emerald Variant exists, for reasons unknown.*

Planetary Body Type: Rocky
