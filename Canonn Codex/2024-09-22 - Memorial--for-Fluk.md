> 
> **MEMORIAL FOR FLUK**
> Fluk was a survivor from the very beginning and had a troubled past, but he never let that get him down. He pulled through and took us all with him, bringing a light to our lives we hadn’t had before. 
> 
> With a wagging tail and caring heart, Fluk was endlessly protective of his closest family and the hole left when he passed hasn’t fully healed, but the memories we have mean he’ll live forever. o7 good boy, we’ll play together again one day.
