The class consists of two command moduls along a central axis, connected by a rotating habitat double ring. 

The rear command module has a large engine module, two additional engine modules on separate structures on its sides, and a smaller third structure consisting of addtional tanks and a small engine module. The command module also has a traffic control tower. 3 turrets defend the rear command module. Both adjacent large engine modules host a Cargo Bay, a Turret and a Hackable Data Transmitter.

The rotating habitat ring hosts three greenhouses facing rearward. Its rotating axis has solar panels.

Along the central axis in direction of travel there are two more cargo bays with a turret each, and a third Hackable Data Transmitter. A rack along the axis mounts additional tanks. The command module in direction of travel is directly at the top. A ship-log uplink can be found there. 

Its default cargo of around 550 tons is Machinery, Metals and Minerals.
