## Formidine Rift Gamma Site

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/formidine-rift-gamma-site/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Eafots RA-G b11-0 system, orbiting body 3. 

The transmission times of this beacon are on the hour, every hour.

The transmitted message is the following:

* * *

> 
> DYJEPQY UWLUDCQCKJ XUEOKJ
> DJPQY P6 UNL003
> NEHHY LKCJQ 3
> SKNICDCJUNCSQ
> UESKQP NEA X11 0
> IKDUPQEJDXY
> (repeated two times)

* * *

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of EXODUS yields the message:

> 
> DYNASTY EXPEDITION BEACON
> DNSTY S6 ERP003
> RALLY POINT 3
> FORMIDINERIFT
> EAFOTS RAG B11 0
> MODESTANDBY

An abandoned settlement can be found within the same system on body 3, at 46.2784, 35.8390 (in Live/4.0) or at -17.8739, -76.0522 (in Legacy/3.8).

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground.

Around the settlement there are six Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

The boys call this place the ‘Formidine Rift’. Apparently that means ‘terror’ in some old Earth language. Nice. Just looks like more space to me.”
