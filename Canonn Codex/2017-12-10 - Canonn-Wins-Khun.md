Content: We did it! A heartfelt thank-you to everyone that helped us to gain controlling influence in Khun. And of course â€“ welcome to our latest member, engineer Elvira Martuuk (maybe we can bring a smile for her, we do bring biscuits after all!)

Congratulations to Patau82, Goemon and the other Faction Progenitors for the final realisation of their long-term plans.
