## Logs

The site has a data core to scan, cargo rack (scan and shoot) and gives two messages (no audio) about the fate of the crew. A small number of materials and cargo can be found in the area. The crash site is quite mountainous, so a small ship is preferable.

Upon entering the Baliscii system, a signal source “Distress Call: Winter’s Grasp” can be found around body 2. 

After dropping into the distress call, 1 Anaconda, 2 Type 9’s and some other wreckage will be found along with 4 Private Data Beacons, however the beacons are empty of any data or logs and there is no sign of a completed rescue.
