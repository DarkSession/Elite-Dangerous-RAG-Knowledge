Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Plaa Aec IZ-N c20-1 system, orbiting body A.

The transmission times of this beacon are on the hour, every hour.

The transmitted message is the following:

* * *

> 
> DYJEPQY UWLUDCQCKJ XUEOKJ
> DYJPQY P6 UNL001
> NEHHY LKCJQ E1E
> BEVGCJP AEL
> LHEE EUO CZJ O20 1
> IKDUPQEJDXY
> 
> (repeated two times)

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of EXODUS yields the message:

> 
> DYNASTY EXPEDITION BEACON
> DYNSTY S6 ERP001
> RALLY POINT A1A
> HAWKINS GAP
> PLAA AEC IZN C20 1
> MODESTANDBY

An abandoned settlement can be found within the same system on body A 1 a, at 26.9844, -88.2929 (in Live/4.0) or at 25.0050, 21.5849 (in Legacy/3.8).

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground, and within the settlement there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

Around the settlement there are four Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:
