## Beckett-class Researcher

Published: 10 Apr 2022 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/beckett-class-researcher/)

Content: The Beckett-class Researcher is a type of Science Vessel.

It consists of a central Axis with an engine module at the rear, mounting command modules and two rotating habitat rings.

The rear consists of a large double engine module, a smaller double engine module, and four single manouvering engines. One turret and a fighter bay defend it. Along the axis in direction of travel one cargo bay and one Hackable Data Transmitter can be found, defended by another Turret. At the same poiint two command modules are mounted perpendicular to the central axis in a 120 degree angle relative to each other.

The two habitat rings in center of the vessel differ in size and rotational speed. Both moutn additional tanks. The smaller, one towards direction of travel consists of three seperate elements, while the rear builds a complete ring.

Further along the central axis in direction of travel there are two more command modules build identical to the rear once, again with a turret. Another Cargo Bay, Turret and Hackable Data Transmitter can be found further towards direction of travel along with the Ship-Log Uplink. The fifth command module, which is a bit smaller builds the top.

Its default cargo of around 200 tons is Chemicals, Industrial Materials, Metals and Technology.
