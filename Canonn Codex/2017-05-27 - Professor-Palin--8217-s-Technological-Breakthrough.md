Palin also researches alien technologies such as Unknown Artefacts, and offers Cargo Racks that resist their corrosive effects during transport. His base of operations is the Palin Research Centre on Maia A 3 A.

Professor Palin now an Engineer since update 2.2 The Engineers is able to produce a Corrosive Resistant Cargo Rack or CRCR for short, these cargo racks allow CMDRs to hold Unknown Probes and Unknown Artefacts in their ship without taking Corrosive damage, although the Cargo capacity is significantly reduced compared to normal cargo racks.
