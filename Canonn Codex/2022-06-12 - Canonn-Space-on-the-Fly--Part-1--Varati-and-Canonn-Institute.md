Don’t forget to check out Varati’s system description on the Galaxy Map. We start at Thompson Dock, Varati (where else?).

**1.1.1 Thompson Dock: Default Coriolis**

**1.1.2 Economy Single Industrial**

**1.1.3 Contacts: Material Trader**

Thompson Dock is a standard coriolis station with an old interior, and single industrial economy. Basically all station interiors looked like that some years ago.

It has a manufactured materials trader, one of two in Canonn Space. 

[Thompson Dock](https://canonn.science/codex/thompson-dock/)was target for both Community Goals Canonn hosted – the one which built Canonn Institute, and the one that built The Gnosis. If The Gnosis isn’t in system, we will  jump with *HN Shockmount* over to *Col 285 Sector IX-T d3-43* Canonn Institute, but return to Varati afterwards.

**1.1.3.b The Gnosis**

If [The Gnosis](https://canonn.science/codex/the-gnosis/)is in system – every 4 months or so – it will be close by and has an impressive view of Varati A6, the earth-like world Thompson Dock is orbiting. Buy some HN Shockmount and say hello to “Canonn Gnosis Division”, who runs the ship, and bring some Consumer Tech, Performance Enhancers or Progenitor Cells back to Thompson dock, before jumping to Col 285 Sector IX-T d3-43.

- at Thompson Dock buy HN Shockmount
- jump 7,88 ly to Col 285 Sector IX-T d3-43

**1.2. Col 285 Sector IX-T d3-43 (Canonn Institute)**

**1.2.1 Tourist Beacon (A 1 – 24,79 ls)**

Drop to the Tourist Beacon next to the station. Scanning it will give you some lore behind Canonn Institute.

**1.2.2 Canonn Institute: Scientific Outpost**

**1.2.3 Single High Tech Economy**

[Canonn Institute](https://canonn.science/codex/canonn-institute/)itself is an outpost of the Scientific Type. We’ll sell our goods and pick up Performance Enhancers or Consumer Tech, before jumping back to Varati. 

There are two more surface ports in system less visited these days. Kagan Vision was the only Canonn controlled port which had a malfunction by Unknown Probes. Phillifent Point is a Military Port, which used to give Bounty Hunting Missions to Varati and was used a lot during the early times when Canonn just took control of Varati.

- sell HN Shockmount
- buy Performance Enhancers or Consumer Tech
- jump 7,88 ly to Varati

**1.3.1 Listening Post (A 3 – 315 ls)**

Oh yes, [one of those](https://canonn.science/codex/listening-posts/)! Resolve its contact to get an Inbox Message.

**1.3.2 Forsskal Hub: Pirate Outpost (A 3 – 315 ls)**

Forsskal Hub was originally controlled by Varati Ring, so it flags The Jolly Roger to this day. You can find the Skull painted at several places.  It’s a mixed Industrial-Extraction economy as you can see from its Commodity Market – selling manufactured goods as well as minerals. We’ll export some Onionhead Gamma Strain and travel almost 60 LY.

- sell your goods
- buy Onionhead Gamma Strain
- jump 59,22 ly to Hip 114099
