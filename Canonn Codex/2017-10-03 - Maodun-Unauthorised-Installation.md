## Maodun Unauthorised Installation

Published: 03 Oct 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/maodun-unauthorised-installation/)

Content: An Unauthorised Installation may be found in orbit of Maodun, in the Isinor system. Please note that as Isinor is Permit Locked, you will need to gain reputation with the **The Chapter of Isinor** and be offered a permit acquisition opportunity (which can occur at Malerba Orbital in Anotchadiae) before being able to visit.

The installation area contains a number of aggressive local system faction ships, and there is a convoy beacon in the system. The installation is not known to be of any scientific interest.
