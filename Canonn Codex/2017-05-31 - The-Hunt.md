## The Hunt

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/the-hunt/)

Content: This mystery began with distortions and interruptions to video transmissions by CMDR Braben in August 3302. The interruption provided an image of a crashed ship of unknown design, while the distortions contained binary numbers which, when interpreted as ASCII, yielded the message:

> 
> We’ve found something. Something incredible. Something the whole galaxy will want to see. The truth. We could show it to you, that wouldn’t be much fun so instead we’re going to play a little game.
> 
> 
> To find us, look for a bounty hunter.
> 
> 
> To find more clues, you’ll need pre-logistics support in a system with one star, two belts, three rings and enough radiation to turn you green.
> 
> 
> The hunt begins on the 28th

This was followed by a series of Galnet articles appearing in the Herald newspapers of several systems starting at PRE Logistics Support Gamma.

The bulk of the message consists of a series of binary numbers that can be interpreted as ASCII, which yielded a series of space-separated two digit numbers:

> 
> 71 83 86 32 73 86 87 32 71 73 90 87 86 73 32 68 90 72 32 88 90 73 73 66 82 77 84 32 85 82 72 83 32 87 70 73 82 77 84 32 71 83 86 32 82 77 88 82 87 86 77 71

These numbers can again be interpreted as ASCII, which yielded the message:

> 
> GSV IVW GIZWVI DZH XZIIBRMT URHS WFIRMT GSV RMXRWVMG

Applying the Atbash Latin cipher, we arrived at the final message:

> 
> THE RED TRADER WAS CARRYING FISH DURING THE INCIDENT

The supplementary data in the message is a more traditional clue which directed us to Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.

- Maia is one of the seven sisters, also known as the Pleiades.
- Maia was the mother of Hermes (the messenger).
- The huntman is Orion.
- The Pleiades constellation is said to be pursued by Orion across the sky.
- Obsidian is a black volcanic glass.

The bulk of the message consists of a series of roman numerals that can be interpreted as the decimals:

> 
> 52 55 32 55 53 32 55 50 32 50 48 32 52 101 32 54 54 32 54 51 32 50 48 32 55 54 32 54 54 32 50 48 32 52 99 32 55 50 32 55 57 32 55 57 32 54 50 32 54 97

These decimals can be interpreted as ASCII, which yielded a series of space-separated two digit hexadecimal numbers:

> 
> 47 75 72 20 4e 66 63 20 76 66 20 4c 72 79 79 62 6a

Once again these hexadecimal numbers can be interpretd as ASCII, which yielded the message:

> 
> Gur Nfc vf Lryybj

Applying a ROT13 encoding (equivalent to a Caesar Cipher with a shift of 13) , we arrived at the final message:

> 
> The Asp is Yellow

The supplementary data in the message is a more traditional clue which directed us to Cooper Research Centre in the HIP 19072 system.

- Cooper is the profession of making drums, casks and barrels.
- HIP 19072 4 is an Earth-like world with a single moon.

The bulk of the message consists of morse-code, when line breaks are ignored, and slash symbols treated as breaks between individual parts, it yielded a series of decimals:

> 
> 48 48 46 49 50 32 116 97 32 101 118 105 114 114 97 32 111 116 32 101 117 100 32 115 105 32 97 114 98 111 67 32 65

These decimals can be interpreted as ASCII, which yielded the message:

> 
> 00.12 ta evirra ot eud si arboC A

This message is reversed to arrive at the final message:

> 
> A Cobra is due to arrive at 21.00

The supplementary data in the message is a more traditional clue which directed us to PRE Logistics Support Zeta in the Pleiades Sector HR-W d1-57 system.

- Z place would be an Outpost name related to Z.
- Zeta is the sixth letter in the Greek alphabet.
- Zeta in Greek numerals has the value seven because the letter “digamma” was originally in the sixth position.
- Pleiades Sector HR-W d1-57 has three water worlds around the first start.
- PRE Logistics Support Zeta is around the first of them.

Applying the Atbash Latin cipher, we arrived at the final message:

> 
> THE T9 PILOTS ROUTE TAKES THEM TO SYSTEM CAIL

The supplementary data in the message is a more traditional clue which directed us to PRE Logistics Support Epsilon in the Pleiades Sector JC-V d2-62 system.

- Epsilon is the fifth letter in the Greek alphabet.
- Epsilon in Greek numerals has the value five.
- “Pre-logistics support” is spelled out in the clue.

The supplementary data in the message is a more traditional clue which directed us to PRE Logistics Support Alpha in the 42 n Persei system.

- The top dog in a pack is known as the Alpha.
- The 42 n Persei system has two stars.
- The 42 n Persei system has a purple gas giant with three moons.
- The outpost orbits a purple gas giant.

The bulk of the message consists of morse-code, when the first line break is treated as a break in the morse character, but the second line break is ignored, and slash symbols treated as breaks between individual parts, it yielded the message:

> 
> LFGXVGV POH QTZGN JTILRPGX VHKXI DBCF HKICOL ZH HIRXXTTB TA

Applying the Vigenère cipher with a key of TRUTH yielded the message:

> 
> SOMEONE WHO WASNW QMPUXWZE BODER KUJO ODPLUS GQ OBYGDAMI ZH

It was clear that an error had occurred in transmission; the cipher was breaking down because of the missing apostrophe in the word “wasn’t”. We inserted an apostrophe in the appropriate place in the original message:

> 
> LFGXVGV POH QTZG’N JTILRPGX VHKXI DBCF HKICOL ZH HIRXXTTB TA

And then we re-applied the Vigenère cipher with a key of TRUTH to arrive at the final message:

> 
> SOMEONE WHO WASN’T CARRYING CARGO WILL ARRIVE IN APADEMAK AT

Unfortunately no time is given in the message.

The supplementary data in the message is a more traditional clue which directed us to PRE Logistics Support Delta in the Hyades Sector AB-W b2-2 system.

- In legal shorthand, the defendant is identified by the delta symbol.
- The Hyades Sector AB-W b2-2 system consists of fourteen icy moons around a single star.

The supplementary data in the message is a more traditional clue which directed us to Nehsi Landing in the HIP 17655 system.

- Nehsi was an official at the court of the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Hatshepsut.
- Nehsi held the position of Wearer of the Royal Seal.
- The word Nehsi translates to “He of Nubia.”
- Nehsi Landing is on the third planet of nine in the system.

The bulk of the message consists of a series of roman numerals that can be interpreted as the decimals:

> 
> 48 49 48 49 48 48 49 49 32 48 49 48 48 48 49 48 48 32 48 49 48 48 49 49 48 49 32 48 49 48 49 49 48 49 48 32 48 49 48 49 48 48 49 49 32 48 49 48 49 48 48 48 49 32 48 49 48 48 48 49 48 48 32 48 48 49 48 48 48 48 48 32 48 49 48 49 48 48 48 48 32 48 49 48 48 48 48 48 49 32 48 49 48 49 48 48 48 49 32 48 49 48 48 48 49 48 49 32 48 49 48 49 49 48 49 48 32 48 48 49 48 48 49 49 49 32 48 49 48 48 48 49 49 48 32 48 48 49 48 48 48 48 48 32 48 49 48 48 49 49 49 49 32 48 49 48 48 49 49 48 49 32 48 49 48 48 48 49 48 48 32 48 49 48 48 48 49 48 48 32 48 49 48 48 49 48 49 49 32 48 48 49 48 48 48 48 48 32 48 49 48 48 49 49 49 49 32 48 49 48 48 49 49 48 49 32 48 49 48 48 48 49 48 48 32 48 49 48 49 48 48 49 49 32 48 49 48 48 48 48 48 49 32 48 48 49 48 48 48 48 48 32 49 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 49 48 48 49 49 32 48 48 49 48 48 48 48 48 32 48 49 48 49 48 49 48 48 32 48 49 48 49 48 48 48 49 32 48 48 49 48 48 48 48 48 32 48 49 48 49 48 49 48 48 32 48 49 48 48 49 49 48 49 32 48 49 48 49 49 48 49 48 32 48 49 48 49 48 48 49 49 32 48 49 48 48 48 49 48 49 32 48 48 49 48 48 48 48 48 32 48 49 48 48 49 49 48 49 32 48 49 48 48 48 49 48 48 32 48 49 48 48 48 48 48 49 32 48 49 48 48 48 49 49 49 32 48 49 48 49 49 48 49 48 32 48 49 48 49 48 48 48 48 32 48 48 49 48 48 48 48 48 32 48 49 48 48 49 49 48 49 32 48 49 48 48 48 48 49 48 32 48 49 48 48 49 49 48 49 32 48 49 48 49 48 48 48 48 32 48 49 48 49 48 48 48 49 32 48 49 48 49 49 48 48 49 32 48 49 48 48 49 49 48 49 32 48 49 48 49 48 49 49 49 10

These decimals can be interpreted as ASCII, which yielded a series of space-separated binary numbers, ending in a newline character:

> 
> 01010011 01000100 01001101 01011010 01010011 01010001 01000100 00100000 01010000 01000001 01010001 01000101 01011010 00100111 01000110 00100000 01001111 01001101 01000100 01000100 01001011 00100000 01001111 01001101 01000100 01010011 01000001 00100000 10000000010011 00100000 01010100 01010001 00100000 01010100 01001101 01011010 01010011 01000101 00100000 01001101 01000100 01000001 01000111 01011010 01010000 00100000 01001101 01000010 01001101 01010000 01010001 01011001 01001101 01010111 \n

Once again these binary numbers can be interpreted as ASCII, apart from the long sequence for that we use the full Unicode character set, and the newline which we ignore, which yielded the message:

> 
> SDMZSQD PAQEZ’F OMDDK OMDSA – TQ TMZSE MDAGZP MBMPQYMW

Applying a Caesar Cipher with a shift of 14 (possibly intended to be ROT13 followed by a shift of +1 given other clues), we arrived at the final message:

> 
> GRANGER DOESN’T CARRY CARGO – HE HANGS AROUND APADEMAK

The supplementary data in the message is a more traditional clue which directed us to Kippax Dock in the Ngalia system.

- Ngalia basin is a sedimentary basin in central Australia, and may have once been part of the centralian superbasin.
- Ngalia system is controlled by Sirius Inc.
- 1804 years before 3302 is 1498.
- Francisco Serrão is probably the explorer, though he set sail in 1512.
- Three stations in the system; Green Enterprise, Tall Enterprise, and Kippax Dock; clue says not tall or green.

## Cail Community Goal

While it appears that this was intended to be the end of the mystery, a community goal was later posted in the Cail system containing the same text but also containing a clue like the Galnet articles from the other systems:

The appeal had no delivery requirements or goals, the only listed tier was:

> 
> OOPS – 9223372037854775807 UNITS

The bulk of the message consists of a series of binary numbers that can be interpreted as ASCII, which yielded the message:

> 
> UIG FYRQPSGW XCX MCXU UJFO NO UDTUGR QKH UQP IG SFVZSOU FBEM ECD BV UITJF RR HOY

Applying the Vigenère cipher with a key of OOPS yielded the message:

> 
> GUR RKCYBERE JNF YNFG FRRA VA FLFGRZ CVP GBX UR ERGHEAF RNPU QNL NG GUERR CZ TZG

Applying a ROT13 encoding (equivalent to a Caesar Cipher with a shift of 13) , we arrived at the final message:

> 
> THE EXPLORER WAS LAST SEEN IN SYSTEM PIC TOK HE RETURNS EACH DAY AT THREE PM GMT

## Combined Clues

The combined information from each article, and the community goal, provided the following clues:

- The Red Trader was carrying Fish during the incident.
- The Asp is Yellow.
- A Cobra is due to arrive at 21.00.
- The T9 pilot’s route takes them to system Cail.
- Dillon never carries cargo.
- Someone who wasn’t carrying cargo will arrive in Apademak at.
- A trader called Kohl will arrive in Cail at 10.00.
- Grander doesn’t carry cargo – he hangs around Apademak.
- The explorer was last seen in system Pic Tok he returns each day at Three PM GMT.

## Logan Kohl

At 10:00 on 28 Aug 3302 a trader by the name of CMDR Logan Kohl, flying a red Type-9, appeared in the Cail system and transmitted the following communication to all pilots within range:

> 
> So you figured it out! Well done, Commander.
> 
> I realize you were probably expecting something a little more exciting than some loser in a T9.
> 
> But there’s something cool coming up, I promise.
> 
> See, we found something, me and my pals. It’s going to blow your mind!
> 
> The thing is, I’m not allowed to tell you what it is.
> 
> Or where it is. The boss said so. And I know better than to argue with the boss.
> 
> So I’m going to give you a clue. Now, what was it again? I wrote it down somewhere.
> 
> Ah, here we are:
> 
> One of my friends always lies. The system has a single M-class star.
> 
> I know what you’re thinking: is that it?
> 
> Well, there’s more, but it’s going to cost you.
> 
> The idea is that people bring me narcotics, and I give out another clue
> 
> Assuming they bring me enough, that is. Simple, right? Right
> 
> There’s nothing more I can give you now.

An appeal was later issued to appropriate the requested narcotics:

> 
> **Narcotics for Logan Kohl**
> 
> 
> Deliver Narcotics to Bridger Enterprise in the Cail system to receive a second clue from Logan Kohl.
> 
> 
> A smuggler by the name of Logan Kohl claims to have made a discovery of profound importance. Although Kohl has offered a clue to the location of this discovery, he has said he will only reveal further information if he is given “enough narcotics to kill a rhinoceros.”
> 
> 
> Independent pilots are therefore invited to deliver quantities of narcotics to Bridger Enterprise in the Cail system. If Kohl’s targets are met, he will offer the public a second clue.

This appeal began on 29 Aug 3302 and was successfully completed; the clue provided by Kohl was:

> 
> The latitude was -26 and it was cold moon in the Pleiades sector with the letters ‘AB’ in its name.

## Mahina Dillon

At 15:00 on 28 Aug 3302 a pilot by the name of CMDR Mahina Dillon, flying a yellow Asp Explorer, appeared in the Apademak system and transmitted the following communication to all pilots within range:

> 
> I was wondering if anyone would show up.
> 
> Ive been flying in circles for hours. Granger and his stupid games.
> 
> I guess you want to know what all the clues and messages are about.
> 
> Well, my friends and I made a discovery – a discovery so big, the whole galaxy will want to see it.
> 
> We figured the find was worth something, so we decided to make you work for it.
> 
> Hence the clues and riddles.
> 
> But the funs not over yet – there are more clues to come.
> 
> The good news is that the next one is free. Here it is:
> 
> I visited a rocky planet at latitude 34 near binary pulsars.
> 
> To get the second clue, you’ll have to do something for me.
> 
> See, theres nothing I like more at the end of a long day than lighting up a nice cigar.
> 
> So…
> 
> If you and the other fine people playing this little game deliver tobacco to me at McMullen Vision,
> 
> Ill give you a second clue.
> 
> Thats the deal take it or leave it.

An appeal was later issued to appropriate the requested tobacco:

> 
> **Tobacco for Mahina Dillon**
> 
> 
> Deliver tobacco to McMullen Vision in the Massagetae system to receive a second clue from Mahina Dillon.
> 
> 
> A gambler by the name of Mahina Dillon claims to have made a discovery of profound importance. Although Dillon has offered a clue to the location of this discovery, she has said she will only reveal further information is she is given “enough tobacco to last a lifetime”.
> 
> 
> Independent pilots are therefore invited to deliver quantities of Tobacco to McMullen Vision in the Massagetae system. If Dillon receives enough of the popular plant, she will offer the public a second clue.

This appeal began on 30 Aug 3302 and was successfully completed; the clue provided by Dillon was:

> 
> I found something around planet eleven – a planet with the letters ‘CJ’ in its name – at longitude -13 in the Spirograph sector.

## Otto Granger

At 21:00 on 28 Aug 3302 a pilot by the name of CMDR Otto Granger, flying a white Cobra Mk3, appeared in the Apademak system and transmitted the following communication to all pilots within range:

> 
> I suppose youre wondering what its all about.
> 
> The clues. The messages. Well Ill tell you.
> 
> We found something, me and my associates.
> 
> Something the whole galaxy will want to see.
> 
> You want to know what it is, right? Well Id love to tell you…
> 
> But with information this valuable, Id be a fool to give it away for free.
> 
> So here’s what Im going to do. Im going to give you a clue, right now.
> 
> Are you ready? Here it is:
> 
> I visited a system with ten bodies and one sun. After the incident I woke up in a system far away.
> 
> It isnt much to go on, I know, but if you do something for me, you’ll get a second clue.
> 
> See, Ive always had a weakness for the sauce. Lavian Brandy being a particular favourite.
> 
> So Im going to ask folks to deliver it to me at Scott Orbital one of these days.
> 
> If I get enough, Ill give you all another hint.

An appeal was later issued to appropriate the requested brandy:

> 
> **Lavian Brandy for Otto Granger**
> 
> 
> Deliver Lavian Brandy to Scott Orbital in the Apademak system to receive a second clue from Otto Granger.
> 
> 
> A smuggler by the name of Otto Granger claims to have made a discovery of profound importance. Although Granger has offered a clue to the location of this discovery, he has said he will only reveal further information if he is given enough Lavian Brandy to “drink himself into an early grave”.
> 
> 
> Independent pilots are therefore invited to deliver quantities of Lavian Brandy to Scott Orbital in the Apademak system. If Granger receives enough of the popular libation, he will offer the public a second clue.

This appeal began on 30 Aug 3302 and was successfully completed; the clue provided by Kohl was:

> 
> The longitude was 97 on the tenth body in the Pleiades sector in a system with the letters ‘B2’ in it’s name. Oh, and Khol always tells the truth.

## Combined Clues

**Logan Kohl:**

- One of my friends always lies. The system has a single M-class star.
- The latitude was -26 and it was cold moon in the Pleiades sector with the letters ‘AB’ in its name.

**Mahina Dillon:**

- I visited a rocky planet at latitude 34 near binary pulsars.
- I found something around planet eleven – a planet with the letters ‘CJ’ in its name – at longitude -13 in the Spirograph sector.

**Otto Granger:**

- I visited a system with ten bodies and one sun. After the incident I woke up in a system far away.
- The longitude was 97 on the tenth body in the Pleiades sector in a system with the letters ‘B2’ in it’s name. Oh, and Khol always tells the truth.

It can be deduced that Mahina Dillon is the liar.

While the clues implied that Mahina Dillon was the Explorer, since she arrived at 15:00, the CG identified her as a Gambler. It was never established who the Bounty Hunter was, while Granger is the remaining candidate, the CG identified him as a Smuggler.

The clues led to the [Crashed Thargoid Ship](https://canonn.science/codex/crashed-thargoid-ship/), and was found by CMDRs Noctrach and Ihazevich after the end of the first community goal, without the additional two clues.
