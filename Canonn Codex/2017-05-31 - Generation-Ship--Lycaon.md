## Generation Ship: Lycaon

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/generation-ship-lycaon/)

Content: Lycaon is an abandoned Generation Ship that can be found in the Alaunus system, 30,189 Ls away from the Main star and around 22,557 Ls away from body 10, in the direction of the Horae system. 

The ship was reported by CMDR **Lexic Maise** and CMDR **EfilOne** (Source: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/6711vr/the_first_generation_ship_has_been_discovered/))

The location is revealed by the Listening Post in the LHS 1047 system, orbiting body 2:

## Logs

A series of five Ship Log Uplink points can be located along the hull. Deploy your ship’s hardpoints and use the onboard Data Link Scanner within 200m of each post to scan them and retrieve the logs. In addition to the text, each log is accompanied by an audio recording:

> 
> **CONTAGION 1/5**
> Physician’s Log 2379/2
> 
> Nothing out of the ordinary to report. Minor injuries, aches and pains from the more vulnerable crew members and the usual bout of influenza you’d expect with so many people living in such close confines. It seems the current strain of influenza is becoming resistant to the vaccines we’ve developed on board.

> Only thing of note was a minor injury to one of the survey team. Gottleib sustained a minor laceration. He was taking a mineral sample on a nearby asteroid. The suit got breached but he managed to apply an emergency seal before anything serious happened. I only hope the sample he took was worth the scar it’s gonna leave.

> 
> **CONTAGION 2/5**
> Physician’s Log 2387/8
> 
> We have an emergency. The strain of influenza infecting the ship has become completely resistant to any vaccines or treatment we can find. 13% of the ship’s population has now succumbed to the infection and so far eight have died. I’ve initiated emergency measures and quarantined the infected. The epidemiologist, Doctor Munroe, is working round the clock to find a solution – I’m sure she’ll come up with a cure before long.

> **CONTAGION 3/5**
> Physician’s Log 2463/5

> Doctor Munroe made a discovery that has filled me with dread. This contagion doesn’t derive from the influenza epidemic – it’s altogether more alien than that. The contaminant has no human origin – it comes from Gottleib, the scientist who was injured a few days ago. Whatever mineral he was taking a sample of must have got into his blood. It’s mutated into some kind of virulent pathogen. Munroe is unable to isolate the microorganism that’s causing it. It spreads… fast. Quarantine hasn’t worked and people are starting to panic. We’re doing our best to come up with a counteragent but I’m not sure we have the resources…

> **CONTAGION 4/5**
> Physician’s Log 2499/9

> We are lost. Munroe died two days ago and any chance we had of finding a cure for this epidemic died with her. Half the ship’s population is already dead and 98% of those remaining are infected. Teams are working round the clock to vent the bodies into space but they’re piling up so quickly… The riots haven’t helped. People are panicking, angry, don’t know what to do. When you see your family die I guess you just get desperate.

> I don’t know what to do. Suppose I should do my job but it’s no use. At least I’ve avoided infection. For now…

> I knew I wasn’t going to avoid contracting this thing forever… I’m one of… one of the last. This place is so quiet now. It used to teem with life and now… now there’s just silence along the empty corridors. I should probably go for one last walk… while I still can…
