Subject: Eagle Eye Report Week 6 - 17/04/3304

Eagle eye has identified the systems 32 c Piscium and Kunuvi - However this week the Thargoids decided to show up quite late. We have no discernable reason for this activity but for the Thargoids to perhaps confuse our intelligence. Furthermore Guidoni Enterprise in the HIP 9599 system has been attacked. This target was not identified by EE. Non combatants are requested to proceed with Project: Hrafnagud.
