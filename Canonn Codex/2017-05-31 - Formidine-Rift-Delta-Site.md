## Formidine Rift Delta Site

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/formidine-rift-delta-site/)

Content: An Unregistered Comms Beacon can be found in the Eafots GL-Y e2 system, orbiting body 1. 

The transmission times of this beacon are on the hour, every hour.

The transmitted message is the following:

* * *

> 
> DYJEPQY UWLUDCQCKJ XUEOKJ
> DJPQY P6 UNL003
> NEHHY LKCJQ 6
> SKNICDCJUNCSQ
> UESKQP AHY U2
> IKDUPQEJDXY
> (repeated two times)

* * *

Applying a Keyed Caesar cipher with the key of EXODUS yields the message:

> 
> DYNASTY EXPEDITION BEACON
> DNSTY S6 ERP003
> RALLY POINT 6
> FORMIDINERIFT
> EAFOTS GLY E2
> MODESTANDBY

An abandoned settlement can be found within the same system on body 6, at 39.4445, 111.5341 (in Live/4.0) or at 21.2753, 19.0667 (in Legacy/3.8).

Around the settlement there are six Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

More money than I’ve ever earned and all in one go, just for taking a year out. What’s a poor girl got to do? A bit of a jaunt into the void, how bad could it be? Didn’t read the bit about several thousand light years. I’ve never even been past Leesti before! Get rich quick scheme – let’s go!”

You should see it, lots of bright blue stars nearby, wish we could divert to have a closer look, but our mission is beyond apparently. Really brings back how big the galaxy is. Makes you feel real small and insignificant.”

Who needs a beacon this far out anyway? Weird, they all have this code in their BIOS – ‘Exodus’. Still, at least I now have something to do. The journey was so dull! Months of travel to get out here.”

Stayed that way for about two minutes. Then everything was back to normal. Affected our support ship too. No idea what caused it. Going to need new underwear when I get back. Rumours are there is something odd about this area of space.”

Signalled my support ship – no response. Flew back and it was gone, just debris. No survivors. Don’t know what happened. It’s just me and this crappy old Sidewinder a zillion miles from home. Should have known it wasn’t going to work out. If it’s too good to be true… There’s an Earth-like world here, going to try and reach it… you never know.”
