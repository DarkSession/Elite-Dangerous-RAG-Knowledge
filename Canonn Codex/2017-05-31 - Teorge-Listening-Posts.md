## Teorge Listening Posts

Published: 31 May 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/teorge-listening-posts/)

Content: On 29 Apr 3303, Lady Kahina Loren – also known as Salomé – and her co-conspirators Raan Corsen, Tsu Annabelle Singh and Yuri Nakamura attempted to reach the Tionisla Graveyard bubble from the 46 Eridani system. While their leader did not make it, the rest of the group did, and they learned of and revealed the location of a set of Listening Posts in the Teorge system.

Scanning each of the posts in turn gives the following logs.

If there is any fame to be had it is what you make of it, maybe some chronicler will immortalise you in the future.”

I don’t know what tech you have in the future to make that voyage a little easier, but I spent years following this, trying to unravel it all and so did many others before me.

> You don’t build a fleet of warships for no reason – too many questions get asked. So you manufacture a threat, you start a phony war. You keep the populace amused with any diversion you can think of. You play powers against each other, you boom and bust the markets to tilt the economy. Anything to stop people looking at the real issues.”

It’s all a fabrication, woven by those who have appointed themselves the protectors of humanity. They’ve been keeping us all in the dark, hiding the truth, secretly prepping for a confrontation.

If you’ve got this far you’ll have read the old lore, you know there was a conflict with an alien race. Yes them. You know what they were capable of in the past. Who’s to say what they could do now?

How do I know all this’?

The author of these recordings appears to be the woman known as Rebecca, and is the same as that who recorded the additional logs at [The Zurara](https://canonn.science/codex/the-zurara/).
