> Make sure your comms system is not an antiquated piece of crap and that you maintain radio contact with flight control in each system, otherwise you might not be able to call for help.

> 
> Oh. I almost forgot this one. On the off chance that you’ve crashed on a planet don’t, whatever you do, trade in your emergency transponder for a bottle of out of date Indi Bourbon a week before the crash. It turns out those things are important and despite what some people might tell you, your ship needs to have one.

> It might seem obvious, but you’d be surprised how many people do it. Yeah, you know who you are.
