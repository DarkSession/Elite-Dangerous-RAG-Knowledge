## Logs

There are Engineer Materials scattered around the ground, and at the entrance of the settlement there is a Data Point which may be scanned for an Intel Package, and for Engineer Data.

Around the settlement there are five Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning them gives background to the reason for its abandonment:

> 
> **MISSING EXPLORER 1/5**
> Sector 5 clear.
> 
> There’s no sign of life on this rock. I don’t know what we expect to find.
> 
> Project log:
> 
> The habitat has been set up and all systems are in the green. It seems that there is some interference with the comms, but it’s probably just some background noise.

> **MISSING EXPLORER 2/5**
> Command, we’ve been at this for days.
> 
> I really don’t see the benefit of continued scans. As it said in the report: lifeless means there is no life here.

> It’s been 6 days since we last heard from Perry. The search of his last known location failed to find anything conclusive. He just disappeared without a trace, the tyre tracks just stop. It makes no sense.
