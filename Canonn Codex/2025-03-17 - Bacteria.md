*True unicellular extremophiles capable of living in the full spectrum of temperatures, chemical soups and atmospheres. They form a kaleidoscopic range of patterns and colours based on their method of metabolism. They derive energy from photosynthetic, chemosynthetic or thermosynthetic processes.*

*Bacteria consistently demonstrate a preference for flat or slightly undulating terrain, typically plains but also flat open areas within otherwise hilly terrain.*

*Bacteria are believed to be the precursors for many lifeforms and are often found in conjunction with member Species of other Genera. Links between the biochemistry of Bacterial colonies and neighbouring organisms are likely but as yet unproven.*

**Variant Determinant: Stellar Class / Material**

Bacteria is one of the Genera with a dual variant determinant. The cross-Species rule for Stellar Class determinant holds true, i.e. Stellar Class X = Variant Colour Y across all Stellar Class determinant Species within the Genus.

For Stellar Class determinant Species in such Genera it is also possible to state generalised planetary body type and atmosphere preferences as these show a relatively limited set of values. The same is not true for the Material determinant Species. These show considerably more differentiation, to the extent that no generalisation will be made but each Material determinant Species treated individually.   

**Minimum Colonial Separation: 500m**
