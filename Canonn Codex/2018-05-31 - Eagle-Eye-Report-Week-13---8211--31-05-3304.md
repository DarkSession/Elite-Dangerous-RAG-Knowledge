Eagle Eye Report and Summary of the previous week:

Four times in a row now both target systems were successfully defended - with HR 1257 and Lusonda systems both having the Thargoid threat repelled. This is a phenomenal success, and all in the region owe their thanks to commanders taking to their ships in support, as also noted by Admiral Tanner in a Galnet interview.

Intelligence obtained from Eagle Eye this week shows the targets are HIP 21559 (Morukov Terminal) and LP 581-36 (Atkov Ring), and NHSS have been detected by CMDRs at the scene in both systems, with reports of Interceptors also being seen in HIP 21559.

The Aegis Megaships are unscathed and were dispatched to Dalfur and Spinoni, and according to Eagle Eye the Eagle Eye 3 Installation itself is being targeted for direct attack by Thargoids next week. Wrecked megaships were found in systems nearby. 

The other targets given to us by EE include a previously undiscovered Thargoid Structure location (Synuefe HZ-M d8-69 b 7 f, at 6, -124), and in HIP 7158 the INRA base Hogan.

The discovery of a new TS is great, but I wonder - have the Thargoids cottoned on to our intelligence gathering from Eagle Eye, which gives me concern at what they might throw at us next.
