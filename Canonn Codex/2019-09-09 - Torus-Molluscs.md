## Torus Molluscs

Published: 09 Sep 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/torus-molluscs/)

Content: There are several varieties of Torus Molluscs to be found around the galaxy – notably in the Vulcan Gate sector. They appear inside Notable Stellar Phenomena. Look for the largest concentration of signals inside the phenomena and you should find them (if they are present) – they are small and easy to miss compared to the larger non-organics. 

In-game codex information shows that the different variants appear near different planet types, and have different requirements for Star Types – more can be found in the game codex.

Space lifeforms often have discoverable traits – scan them with the Composition Scanner when they are doing something to reveal the traits. For Torus Molluscs these are the traits:

- Retreats if attacked
- Retreats if approached
