## Imperial Navy Fleet

Published: 08 Jul 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/imperial-navy-fleet/)

Content: The Imperial Navy maintains a number of their vessels on permanent patrol stations, in addition to their active fleet that can be found in Conflict Zones.

Ship’s that do not carry an INV prefix are the personal ships of Senators and others of High Imperial Society.

These ships may occasionally be accompanied by additional Imperial Navy vessels who will open fire on you if you stray too close to them or the Capital Ship. When no additional vessels are around, the Capital Ship is safe to approach.

**Note: since the [Empire’s withdrawal from the Pleiades reported 12 OCT 3303](https://community.elitedangerous.com/en/galnet/uid/59ddfbc6122be924b4645a7d), many of these assigned patrol stations have likely changed.**

- Baal A 2 – Oterma Station
- Cubeo 3 – Chelomey Orbital
- Ditae 2 – Langley Dock
- Ekono A 1 – Lundmark Terminal
- [Facece – Topaz](https://canonn.science/codex/facece-military-installation/) (Military Installation)
- Khruvandji A – Consolmagno Enterprise
- Larg AB 1 – Kagawa Survey
- Lemovi 7 – Royo Dock
- Malaikudi A 1 – Leopold Heckmann Ring
- Ugrivirii 2 – Jefferies Port

These dock facilities have dual berths containing two Majestic-class Interdictors, both showing signs of battle damage, and undergoing repairs. The ships are never not broadcasting a transponder signal, and do not carry any identifying hull markings, so cannot be identified.

One or more Satellites can be found in the immediate area, giving Engineer Data when scanned.
