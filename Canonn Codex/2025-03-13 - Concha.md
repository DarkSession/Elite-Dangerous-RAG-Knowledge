*Highly specialised complex extremophiles that have developed protective and sturdy motile shell structures. These open and close based on the suitability of the current environmental conditions. The shells are an organic structure with an excreted inorganic insulated and sometimes reﬂective casing that help the organism maintain homeostasis. The internal organisms, which are remarkably tough in their own right, are only exposed for metabolic and reproductive purposes.*

*Concha – where present on a planetary body – seem to excel in valleys and slightly undulating areas surrounded by hills or mountains and  are often found in profusion at the foot of these.*

**Variant Determinant: Stellar Class / Material**

Concha is one of the Genera with a dual variant determinant. The cross-Species rule for Stellar Class determinant holds true, i.e. Stellar Class X = Variant Colour Y across all Stellar Class determinant Species within the Genus.

For Stellar Class determinant Species in such Genera it is also possible to state generalised planetary body type and atmosphere preferences as these show a relatively limited set of values. The same is not true for the Material determinant Species. These show considerably more differentiation, to the extent that no generalisation will be made but each Material determinant Species treated individually.   

**Minimum Colonial Separation: 150m**
