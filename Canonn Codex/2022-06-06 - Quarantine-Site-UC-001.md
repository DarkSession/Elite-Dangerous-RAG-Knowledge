## Quarantine Site UC-001

Published: 06 Jun 2022 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/quarantine-site-uc-001/)

Content: Quarantine Site UC-001 is an abandoned settlement in the HIP 86908 system on body 3 a, at -23.5514, -38.8450 (in Live/4.0) or at 19.0028, -38.8999 (in Legacy/3.8).

This site was found on the 5th June 3308 by Commander Imonix who contacted Canonn to report his discovery.

The location of this site can be found by following the three nearby listening posts located in:
Col 285 Sector NO-Q d5-59 / Col 359 Sector QC-B c1-11 / Col 359 Sector QI-Z c1-11

It should be noted that the listening post at **Col 359 Sector QI-Z c1-11** appears to be in the wrong location for trilateration, and the settlement was actually found using the first two listening posts alone. Based on the distances provided from the 3rd listening post log, the estimated system for the 3rd listening post would have been Col 285 Sector KP-D c13-12.

## Logs

There are no Engineer Materials at the site, but not far from the entrance of the settlement there is a Public Data Point which may be scanned for Engineer Data.

Around the settlement there are five Settlement Comms Log Uplink points, scanning four of them will give some background to the reason for its abandonment, however the fifth uplink does not contain any logs:

>  We’ve found what’s left of the bodies, the quarantine systems kept them pretty juicy. It looks like they dissolved from the inside. Not a good way to go. According to the doctor there is no chance the contaminant could still be active.
