## Inara

Published: 25 Apr 2017 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/resources/inara/)

Content: Canonn has a large presence on Inara, a site providing a wealth of valuable information about stations, outfitting, engineers – as well as allowing you to join a Wing and enjoy the benefits of community links, discussions etc.

Canonn fully endorse and support the Canonn Wing on Inara (it is an official part of the group), but as we do not require sole allegiance to us – and Inara only allows membership of a single Wing – we do not require you to sign up unless you wish to.
