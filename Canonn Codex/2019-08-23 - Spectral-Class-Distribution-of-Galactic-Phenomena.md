Published: 23 Aug 2019 on Canonn (https://canonn.science/codex/spectral-class-distribution-of-galactic-phenomena/)

Content: We are proud to host CMDR Urania Minora’s study of the Spectral Class Distribution of Galactic Phenomena, which aims to bring an understanding of the relationship between the Harvard Stellar Classiﬁcation of a primary star, and what phenomena may be discovered in a system, as a help to guide exploration eﬀorts. The research paper examines details for phenomena of specific interest to Canonn scientists establishing potential patterns and biases from a detailed analysis of available data from 3.28×10^7 known explored systems:
