Title: Thief Strikes Again

Content: A number of invaluable art treasures have been stolen from the Museum of Civilisation on Mars.

Museum historian Dr Imogen Ryang said:

“The stolen pieces include Rembrandt’s Self-Portrait with Two Circles (17th Century), Guernica by Picasso (20th Century) and Terra Absentia by Zoe Okeke (23rd Century). Each of the works was replaced with the image of a winking cat.”

“The loss of so many cultural artefacts is incalculable. This despicable criminal should have been hunted down long ago.”

Culture journalist Kioko McGrath published an alternative view in The Federal Times:

“High-profile crimes such as this have resulted in the ‘winking cat’ motif becoming a popular anti-establishment symbol, appearing in advertising, graffiti and music. Ironically, the calling card of an art thief is now itself a culturally significant work of art.”
