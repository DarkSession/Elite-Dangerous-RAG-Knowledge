The governing faction of the Dhan system has called for support in fending off a spike in local piracy.

Harald Gomes, head of security for the Dhan Empire League, spoke to local reporters:

“It’s becoming obvious that pirates are growing bolder in recent weeks. We’ve received alarming frequent reports of attacks and looting throughout our system’s many planetary rings – icy rings in particular. Our security forces are overwhelmed, and the Imperial navy is occupied in other areas. So, we’re asking for help.”

While piracy hotspots are not unusual, the situation in Dhan has drawn interest due to rumours that Gutamaya analysts have arrived in the system to track the performance of any newly released Corsair vessels used in the fighting.

Dhan Empire League has offered extra rewards to independent combat pilots willing to eliminate criminals and collect bounties in Dhan, after registering at Kidd Station in advance.
