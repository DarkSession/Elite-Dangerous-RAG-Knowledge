Content: Broadcast Cobra has announced that its appeal for commodities has reached a successful conclusion, having received an overwhelming response from the galactic community.

Vast quantities of thorium, indium and superconductors were delivered to Sopwith Dock over the past week. These will allow construction of a megaship from which the organisation will broadcast its take on current events.

Alessandra Koa of Broadcast Cobra issued the following statement:

“We'd like to thank everyone who supported this campaign. We hope that wherever you are, you're always listening.”

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Sopwith Dock in the HIP 16038 system.
