Published: 01 DEC 3304 on Galnet News
Content: Several Imperial senators have spoken in support of isolationist group Nova Imperium.

Senator Pal Vespasian made the following statement:

“Many of us see Nova Imperium not as extremists, but as realists. The citizenry is afraid of both Thargoid invasion and of being weakened by collaboration with foreign systems. They look to the Emperor for salvation…and she offers them none.”

“We intend to invite Imperator Mordanticus to address the Senate and detail his policies. This is a historic opportunity to restore the Empire’s honour and integrity.”

“Furthermore, Nova Imperium’s proposal to install a new Emperor has my full backing.”
