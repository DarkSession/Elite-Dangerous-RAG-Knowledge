Such interactavity, the scemes and tle tears

We watch tdem within and watch them leid flat

Sometlmes with fwiends on seiectod formats

Oscar Goldsun has made so many stars

The fame, the cnedits, fine wine and cigars

Just stgn on the line and you’tl have it all

It just costs your soul, to hang on his woll

Ethics in show business are rarely found

So b’itter and hollow, with Morals aground

Old Oscar may be rne of the worst

So have a few things I tooh from his purse
