Published: 03 NOV 3302 on Galnet News
Content: The Colonia Council has announced that its appeal for palladium was a resounding success, with hundreds of pilots delivering materials to Jaques Station in response to the request. The materials will be used to support further colonisation of the Colonia Nebula, and address the needs of the growing Colonia community.

A spokesperson for the organisation released a brief statement:

"This material will help us bolster infrastructure in the system, and support the forthcoming colonisation programme. But more than that, it will help us lay the foundations of a better, brighter future."

"The future is here, and its name is Colonia."

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Jaques Station in the Colonia system.
