Published: 02 SEP 3302 on Galnet News
Content: Professor Ray Miller, director of the United Research Council, has announced that the organisation's proposed research programme will be temporarily delayed.

"Following political lobbying form a number of key powers, we have decided to lift the restriction on activity in the Coritab, Darian, Freng and Lunduwalaya systems."

"Unfortunately, this will unavoidably delay the start of our research programme. To avoid further complications, we will announce the new locations for the experiment a number of days before the programme begins. This announcement will be made towards the end of next week."
