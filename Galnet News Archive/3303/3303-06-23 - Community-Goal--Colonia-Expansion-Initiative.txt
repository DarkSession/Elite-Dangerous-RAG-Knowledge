Title: Community Goal: Colonia Expansion Initiative
Published: 23 JUN 3303 on Galnet News
Content: As the Colonia community continues to grow, the Junkyard Dogs have placed an open order for various commodities to support another wave of expansion.

A spokesperson for the organisation confirmed the materials would be used to construct new outposts in the region. The amount of materials received will determine exactly how many outposts are built.

The Junkyard Dogs have promised to reward pilots who deliver tantalum, power generators and silver to their base of operations at Tolagarfâ€™s Junkyard.

The campaign begins on the 22nd of June 3303 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.
