Content: The Alliance has announced that its campaign to build a planetary outpost in the California Nebula has received the enthusiastic support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal for construction materials by delivering geological equipment, hazardous environment suits and surface stabilisers to Tshang City in the Furuhjelm III-674 system.

The campaign also received the support of hundreds of combat pilots, who protected those delivering commodities by neutralising agitators in Furuhjelm III-674.

Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon released a brief statement:

"I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to those who supported this campaign. Remember â€“ the Alliance means freedom."

Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Tshang City in the Furuhjelm III-674 system.
