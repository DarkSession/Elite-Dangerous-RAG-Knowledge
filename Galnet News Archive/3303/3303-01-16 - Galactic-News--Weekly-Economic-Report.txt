Title: Galactic News: Weekly Economic Report
Published: 16 JAN 3303 on Galnet News
Content: This report presents the latest data on the economic health of the galaxy's minor factions.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic boom:

Limapa Blue State Commodities

Uru Federal Interstellar

Union of Wolf 359 Labour

Coalition of Ngaliba

Lords of Ngaliba

Cemiess Commodities

Orrere Ring

Eravate Network

Eravate Life Services

Brani Federal Holdings

Boom is usually the result of consistent trade profit and completed trade contracts. When a faction experiences a boom, the wealth of the system it controls temporarily increases and trade missions completed in the system have double the effect on influence. The faction's influence may also increase. Booms typically last until they naturally expire.

Here are the latest factions to experience an economic bust:

HIP 111755 Gold Cartel

Iapodes Purple Dynamic Holdings

NLTT 6667 Republic Party

Green Party of CD-54 4840

Surya PLC

Crimson Transport Ltd

Future of Udegoci

Carpaka Central Industry

HIP 1419 Empire Consulate

Union of Kappa Phoenicis Labour

When a faction experiences a bust, the wealth of the system it controls is temporarily reduced and the faction's influence is temporarily diminished. Trade actions do not contribute to boom while a bust is active. A bust typically has to run its course before ending.
