Title: Freelance Report: Formidine Rift Discovery
Published: 27 APR 3303 on Galnet News
Content: A few days ago, a curious message was discovered by the Hamsters, a group of EM-transmission enthusiasts in the Tionisla system. A short time later, a combined effort from the Children of Raxxla and several other groups decoded the message and discovered it pointed to the Syreadiae JX-F c0 system in the so-called Formidine Rift.

Travelling to the system, pilots discovered a bulk cruiser called the Zurara. The ship's logs painted a haunting picture, indicating that the shipâ€™s crew sabotaged the vessel before killing themselves. The Zurara had been adrift in the system ever since.
