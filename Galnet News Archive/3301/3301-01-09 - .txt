Content: Federal President Booed

This morning during the ceremony to mark the start of term at the prestigious Olympus Village University When President Halsey began her talk a large number of the assembled students began booing her.

The university principal apologised profusely to the President before she left. Nevertheless the damage was done, and the event was carried on newsfeeds throughout much of human space â€“ and her embarrassed and indecisive reaction and she attempted to proceed with her speech is now the butt of much satirical humour.
