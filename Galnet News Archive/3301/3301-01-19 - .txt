Content: Patreus Queries Emperor’s Coma in the Senate

In the first Senate session in the New Year since the public holidays, Senator Denton Patreus, Senator for Eotienses, has asked the burning question of the Senate. He directed it at the Chancellor, Senator Blaine -

“It saddens us to hear that his grace Emperor Hengist has fallen into a coma, but we need to think for the future of our beloved Empire. How long will his grace be in a coma before we trigger the succession? This has not happened in over a thousand years, and it is for us to decide. One day? One week? One month? One year?

“We need a strong leader, and we should set a date in the near future when we review the situation.”

There was a frisson of mumbling in the Senate after his comments and a general consensus to review the situation at the next session.
