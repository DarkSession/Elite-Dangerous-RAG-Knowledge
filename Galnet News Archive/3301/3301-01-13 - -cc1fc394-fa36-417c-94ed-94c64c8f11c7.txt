Content: Suspicions raised over VP Death

Fresh revelations have added uncertainty to reports Vice President Smeaton’s death due to a suspected heart attack.

Retrieved data from the security systems at his apartment indicate they were not functioning at the time. It’s also been revealed that he completed a clean full medical scan in his private scanner only an hour before his death.

His partner Alder Simons, who was not there at the time, believes Smeaton was murdered. He explained there were other irregularities such as the apartment appearing to have just been cleaned.

The mystery deepened with the revelation that six minutes of the satellite surveillance data for the area appeared to have been distorted by electromagnetic interference. This does happen from time to time, but rarely in calm weather conditions such as those on the night of the Vice President’s death.
