Content: Aisling Duval Talks Narcotics

In the popular show “A fireside chat with Serena”, the celebrity royal, Aisling Duval, surprisingly talked through tears about narcotics -

“Yes Serena, that’s my early childhood. I hate narcotics and think they should be made illegal. My mother died from them before I was old enough to remember her.”

When asked about her father she replied -

“Oh Serena. He was led astray in his youth, but Dad is a lovely man, and would make a great Emperor if his controlling father wasn’t so spiteful.”

Commentators have expressed outrage at her comments about our beloved Emperor, and the network cut the broadcast at that point.
