Content: Federal Warship Arrives in Luluwala

Senator Torval has criticised the arrival of a Federal warship now stationed in the Luluwala system.

“They think they can throw their weight around. Stationing a warship at this small outpost can only be a distraction from their lack of enforcement of their own laws.

“They think stationing a cruiser in Luluwala is a show of strength? A show of real strength would be to move against slavery in the Federation. Really they are being weak.”

There has been no comment from the Federal government as yet.
