Content: Slave Rebellion Breaks out in Ongkuma

Rumours are coming in from multiple sources that rebellion has broken out amongst slaves in Ongkuma.

This news has surprised commentators given the speed with which the Sorbago rebellion was crushed last year. Some commentators speculate that the rebel leaders are relying on intervention from independent pilots, although many consider this to be a foolish hope after the widespread support the Senator received in the Sorbago campaign.

Indirect confirmation came from a comment in social media from a lowly shipyard loader driver, who posted that the ‘Cleopatra’ and the ‘Marlin’, two of Senator Torval’s Majestic Class Interdictors, were being provisioned to leave for the Ongkuma system.

Senator Torval is still on her holiday cruise on the ‘Xanadu’ so was unavailable for comment.
