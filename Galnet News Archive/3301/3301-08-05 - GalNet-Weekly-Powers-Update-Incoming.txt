In the early hours of tomorrow morning (7.00am GMT) the GalNet monitoring of powersâ€™ activities will go offline for a short period while the latest data is assembled.

Any pilots who operate for any of the powers should ensure they deliver any cargo or vouchers before this time for their activities to be registered.
