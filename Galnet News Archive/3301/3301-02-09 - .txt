Content: Prism Senator Courts Controversy Again!

In a move which is likely to further increase tensions between the Federation and the Empire, a high ranking Lady of the Empire has been denied access to the Sol system.

Lady Kahina Tijani Loren, the Senator from the Prism system, was on a diplomatic mission at the behest of Chancellor Blaine when her Imperial Courier was interdicted whilst jumping into the Sol system.

According to Imperial sources, Lady Kahinaâ€™s vessel came under attack by unidentified ships, but fought its way free despite suffering significant damage during the incident.

Federal representatives insist that the Imperials failed to file a valid itinerary, which resulted in a lack of an escort through Federal space. The Empire has demanded a formal apology from the Federation, but so far this demand has gone unanswered.

Lady Kahina was quoted as saying, "I don't like to be late."
