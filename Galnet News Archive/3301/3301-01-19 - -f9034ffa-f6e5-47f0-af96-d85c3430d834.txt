Content: The Menace of Illegal Racing

Traders operating in several systems have called on the authorities to clamp down on increasing levels of illegal racing-

“These speeding ships are a menace!” a representative declared. “They perform dangerous manoeuvres at ridiculous speeds and that puts honest traders like us in danger.”

Official comment has not been forthcoming and one such racer posted anonymously on social media stating-

“The Buckyball Race is the best thing ever and I’d like to see one of the system authority Vipers try and keep up with us!”
