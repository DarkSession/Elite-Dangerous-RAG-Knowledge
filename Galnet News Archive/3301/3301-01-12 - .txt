Content: Federal Vice President Dies in Swimming Accident

In a shocking development on Mars, Federal Vice President Nigel Smeaton was discovered dead in his private swimming pool at his luxury apartment on the foothills of Mount Olympus. A heart attack is suspected, but an investigation is ongoing.

The news will come as another blow to an already beleaguered President who some pundits claim is considering resigning her post.

A new VP will have to be appointed, and several senior Congressmen have suddenly been giving doorstep speeches to get themselves in the public eye.
