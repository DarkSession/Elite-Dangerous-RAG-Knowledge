Content: Compassion was the Cure for Ngaliba

The community of Ngaliba managed to avoid a fate worse than death this past weekend, as hundreds of aid workers flew to the region to help find a cure for the plague that had been ravaging its way through the system.

Imperial, Federal and Independent pilots from all walks of life came together to provide the vital resources needed to save countless lives. Thanks to their efforts there were less than a dozen confirmed causalities before a cure was finally found.

Samples of the Ngaliba Plague have been sent on to all major virus repository databases as protection against any potential future outbreaks.
