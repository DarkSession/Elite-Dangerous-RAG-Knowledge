Content: Congressman Had Early Knowledge of VP’s Death?

The press furore over the death of the Federal Vice President has been given a new burst of life, after a recording of a local constituency meeting was released on the scurrilous news channel ‘The Low Down’.

In the otherwise low-key meeting held in a village outside Quenisset, Mars, on January 12th, the local mayor offered his condolences to the family and friends of a local businessman murdered during a robbery earlier in the week. George Fallside, the local Congressman, was present at the meeting. The Congressman, who was clearly distracted by social media at the time of the meeting, followed the mayor’s speech by offering his condolences to the Vice President’s family.

This was an hour after the VP’s death, but half an hour before the news of his death broke. The Congressman was not available for comment, but an aide has said -

“Is it a big deal? He clearly misheard what was said.”

On ‘The Low Down’ they followed up by emphasising the Congressman’s links with the military, and in particularly his non-exec directorship of Core Dynamics.
