Content: Bombing of Panem Resumes

Despite the continuing ‘Oniongate’ protest on the steps of Congress, Admiral Vincent has announced that surface bombing of Panem in the Kappa Fornacis system has resumed, but this time with targeted, genetically engineered biocides to destroy the onionhead crop.

“Automated munitions deployed from orbit, release a gentle mist that then descends on the crop. It is harmless to humans and to other flora and fauna.”

This time, the protests are more muted, and the Shadow President Hudson claimed on the political panel show ‘Face the People’ -

“On the contrary. Now we see the layabouts are more worried about where their next onionhead fix will come from than about the farmers on Panem!”
