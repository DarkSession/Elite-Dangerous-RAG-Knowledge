## Overview

The Imperial Navy was established alongside the Empire in 2296. Initially a small local defence force for Achenar, it entered its first major conflict in 2324, when the Federation sent a fleet from Beta Hydri to forcibly annex Achenar in response to the Empire's perceived genocide of the Mudlark species native to Achenar 6d. When the Federal fleet under Admiral Richard Morgan arrived, the Empire was prepared and ambushed it, then severed its lengthy supply lines. Morgan became entangled in a losing battle of attrition rather than the single, decisive confrontation he had planned, and the Federal fleet was repeatedly stymied in its attempts to establish a foothold in the system. In 2325, Emperor Henson Duval pressed all of the Empire's civilian ships into service alongside the Imperial Navy, creating the Imperial "People's Fleet", which launched a massive, coordinated counterattack against every element of the Federal invasion force that became known as the "Great Battle of Liberation" or "Battle of Achenar". The Imperial Navy drove the invaders all the way back to Beta Hydri, where the two military forces skirmished with each other for over fifty years in the first Federal-Imperial cold war.^[1]^

Since then, the Imperial Navy has grown into a vast military organisation. Unlike the more centralised Federal Navy and the loosely-organised Alliance Defence Force, the Imperial Navy consists of multiple semi-private fleets funded and maintained by various Senators for the defence of their territories. Although the Emperor is the de facto head of the entire Imperial military, in practice the only force under the Emperor's direct command is the Imperial Guard, and the Imperial Navy falls under the command of an Admiral of the Fleet whom the Emperor holds the power to appoint. The Admiral of the Fleet can assume control of any and all of the Imperial Navy's fleets when necessary. The current Imperial Admiral of the Fleet is Senator Denton Patreus, who was awarded the title by Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval on February 22, 3302.^[2]^

Following the shutdown of Aegis on January 18, 3308, its role in defending the superpowers from the Thargoids in the ongoing conflict devolved to each superpower's military force. The Imperial Navy was granted a budget increase by the Senate at Senator Patreus's request so that it could assume this new responsibility.^[3]^

## Services

### Imperial Navy Auxiliary

    - *For the ranks of the Imperial Navy Auxiliary, see Empire/Ranks.*

Commanders of the Pilots Federation can serve in the Imperial Navy Auxiliary.^[4]^^[5]^ This auxiliary force is an organised group that supplements the Imperial Navy, but is not directly integrated. Honorary ranks, which take their names from the titles of Imperial nobility and royalty, are rewarded to individuals for their service, but do not confer any of the associated authority. Instead, members of the Imperial Navy Auxiliary who prove their dedication are granted permission to purchase certain Imperial Navy ships and access important Imperial star systems.
