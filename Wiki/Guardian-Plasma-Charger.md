## Usage

> 
> 
> Plasma Launchers are a hybrid Human-Guardian technology, capable of a more controlled release of plasma than standard accelerators, allowing users to easily regulate the power of the shot. The longer the trigger is held, the greater the shot's damage. Releasing the trigger at any point will automatically fire the round. This weapon is effective against human and alien vessels.

Guardian Plasma Chargers are weapons made with Guardian technology. Nominally similar to the Plasma Accelerator, Guardian Plasma Chargers deal less damage and cannot be engineered. However, they offer some benefits, such as reduced heat generation, greater ammo count, and higher projectile speed, in addition to greater effectiveness against Thargoid Interceptors and Thargoid Scouts than human weapons.

## Engineer Modifications

The Guardian Plasma Charger can be modified with the Anti-Guardian Zone Resistance, preventing its decay over time in systems or areas where the Thargoids deployed an anti-Guardian field.

## Purchase Locations

The Guardian Plasma Charger is available for purchase at all stations where a Guardian Technology Broker is present after the module has been unlocked.

| Class | Rating | Weapon Mode | System | Station |

| All | All | All | Brestla | i Sola Prospect |

## Modified Plasma Charger

Pre-Engineered Class 1 and Class 2 Guardian Plasma Chargers with Focused and Overcharged named "Modified Plasma Charger" can be purchased from the Guardian Technology Broker at Prospect's Deep in Mbooni (permit needed). It used to be available at Bright Sentinel, but that megaship was destroyed. Unlike unlocking most other Technology Broker items, which makes them permanently available for purchase with credits at station outfitting services, exchanging the required materials for a Modified Plasma Charger immediately places one module in local storage at no additional cost. The module must also be unlocked repeatedly in order to obtain multiple copies, thus making it a purchase in exchange for materials, aka a Barter, not an unlock. Note that although the included modifications can be removed, Engineers cannot re-apply them or apply any other modifications to these modules.

Purchase (Barter) of a each Class 1 version costs the following Materials and Commodities:

- 1 Guardian Weapon Blueprint Fragment
- 3 Guardian Power Cell
- 3 Guardian Sentinel Weapon Parts
- 4 Guardian Technology Component
- 2 Arsenic

Purchase (Barter) of a each Class 2 version costs the following Materials and Commodities:

- 1 Guardian Weapon Blueprint Fragment
- 5 Guardian Power Conduit
- 5 Guardian Sentinel Weapon Parts
- 4 Arsenic
- 2 Power Transfer Bus
