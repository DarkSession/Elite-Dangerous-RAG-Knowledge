# Thermal Conduit
**Thermal Conduit** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to weapons through Engineering. When applied, the weapon's damage output scales up with the ship's heat level when heat is between 90% and 150%. The resulting damage boost is capped at 160%, when the ship's heat level is 150%.

## Applicability

This effect is available to the following weapons:

- Beam Laser
- Plasma Accelerator

## Required Materials

- 5x Heat Dispersion Plate
- 5x Sulphur
- 5x Tempered Alloys
