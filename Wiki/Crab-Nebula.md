Crab Nebula
 		 	 

The **Crab Nebula** is a nebula in the Sanguineous Rim, located around 6,000 light years away. It is one of the brightest sources of high-energy radiation in the sky. It is the expanding remains of an exploded star, a supernova seen in 1054. The supernova left behind a magnetized neutron star known as a pulsar. It is about the size of Washington DC, but it spins 30 times a second. Each rotation sweeps a lighthouse-like beam, creating a pulse of electromagnetic energy detectable across the spectrum.
