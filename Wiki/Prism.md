**Prism** is an Imperial system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It was forcefully annexed by Senator Algreb Loren in 3297, but resentment against the Imperial regime culminated in a violent coup in 3300. Senator Loren and most of his household were killed. One of Loren's three daughters, Kahina Tijani Loren, managed to survive and reemerged to lead the reclamation of the system, and in early 3301, she succeeded her late father as Senator of Prism.^[1]^ Kahina disappeared again in July 3301, leaving her duties to Ambassador Cuthrick Delaney, who commissioned a new division of the Prism defence force called Loren's Legion. In October 3302, the Imperial Senate formally stripped Kahina of her rank for dereliction of duty, by which time administration of Prism had already been officially transferred to Senator Denton Patreus.^[2]^

## Notes

- Prism is a rare example of a system that takes its name from a star other than its most massive star, in this case Sapphire.
- Prism is a "handcrafted" system created to align with the novel *Elite: Reclamation*.
- The planet Daedalion is a High Metal Content World in *Elite Dangerous*, but is depicted as a Water World in *Elite: Reclamation*.
