### Hudson Contravention Vote is Suspended

Federal Congress has temporarily postponed making a decision on whether to extend presidential term limits.

President Zachary Hudson has proposed to repeal the 77th amendment of the Federal Accord, which specifies that a president can serve for a maximum of eight years. If approved, Hudson would become eligible for re-election in June 3309.

A statement was delievered by President Hudson:

"I have agreed that more time is needed to analyse the potential reprecussions of this change to the Federation's constitution. A congressional subcommittee will perform a detailed inquiry to investigate the civil and legal aspects."

"In addition, I am very conscious of the public disturbances caused by the Hudson Contravention. This delay should help to defuse poltiical tension and provide our security services with an opportunity to keep the peace."

Shadow President Winters welcomed the president's decision, and spoke of her eagerness to read the subcommittee's report.

## 05 APR

### Marlinists Hold Public Referendum

The population of the Marlinist Colonies will vote to accept or decline the offer to become an Imperial protectorate.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval’s proposal aims to build links between the independent colony systems and the Empire, from where the Marlinists originally fled as political refugees in 3306.

The Marlin Standard ran an editorial summarising the situation:

“Should the Marlinist Colonies remain an isolated republican society, or should we move beneath the Empire’s protective wing? It’s a question that most of us never expected to be asked.”

“Many expressed fierce anger that Emperor Arissa has dared to ask for our allegiance. In her desperation to hunt down the NMLA she persecuted all believers in Marlinism, arresting thousands and displacing millions of her own citizens. Can we now trust her to welcome us back?”

“Others are concerned that the Marlinist Colonies remain vulnerable, claiming that becoming a satellite nation of the Empire would provide military defences as well as economic boosts. And for those still holding on to their past lives, the attraction of reconnecting with friends and family in the Empire is strong.”“Whatever the outcome, First Minister Octavia Volkov’s swift decision to put this issue to a referendum is a splendid example of Marlinism in action. Votes are already being cast, and the result will be revealed at the end of this week.”

## 7 APR

### Taurus Mining Ventures Operation Concludes

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

A corporate initiative to mine and deliver ores to the Synuefe CE-R c21-6 system has ended successfully.

Taurus Mining Ventures had performed scientific research within the system, claiming that the properties of some natural substances had been altered by an unknown type of local radiation.

The company’s head of research Dr Ruben Carpenter announced: 

“We now have sufficiently large quantities of coltan, lithium hydroxide and methanol monohydrate crystals mined from locations in Synuefe CE-R c21-6. These irradiated ores will be analysed to determine their potential commercial value. Samples that were provided from other systems will also be very useful in our comparative studies.”

“To all the pilots who assisted in this endeavour: thank you! Your hard work is greatly appreciated. The Heart of Taurus megaship will remain in Synuefe CE-R c21-6 for several weeks, and you may collect your rewards from there.”

Taurus Mining Ventures confirmed that studies to identify the source, effects and application of the local radiation are continuing. The scientific journal The Empirical has reiterated that these ‘atypical radioactive signatures’ have not been independently verified.

## 8 APR

### Marlinists Reject Emperor’s Offer

A public referendum in the Marlinist Colonies has resulted in the majority voting to remain fully independent from the Empire.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval had proposed to make the colony systems an Imperial protectorate in return for Marlinist allegiance to the Imperial throne. This would have permitted an autonomous government while creating many civil and military links.

First Minister Octavia Volkov announced the referendum’s results in the Marlinist Parliament:

“Our people have given us a clear mandate: the colonies stand alone. In accordance with the key principles of Marlinism, we reject monarchy rule in favour of republican governance and direct representation.”

“Most of us are still haunted by the trauma of becoming refugees in 3306, when millions of innocent Marlinists were accused of supporting terrorist acts. We fled from an Empire that had become intolerant and abusive. This cannot be so easily forgotten.”

“Nevertheless, we recognise that approximately a quarter of our population voted to accept the Emperor’s proposal. The ties to our homelands remain strong, and we still share much culture and history with the Empire. But the will of the masses is evident.”

“I offer my thanks to Her Majesty for extending this offer, and call upon her to recognise and respect the decision of the Marlinist Colonies.”

## 12 APR

### Arissa Accepts Marlinists’ Independence

Following a referendum by the Marlinist Colonies, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has formally recognised their autonomous status.

Prime Consul Kayode Tau of the Marlinist Consulate reported on his latest meeting with the Emperor:

“Her Majesty was clearly uncomfortable with the democratic way in which the ex-Imperial citizens in the colonies now govern themselves. But she gracefully acknowledged that the Marlinist population had declined her invitation to become an Imperial protectorate, and would thus remain independent.”

“However, there was a proviso to Emperor Arissa’s acceptance of the decision. She insisted that the Marlinist Colonies must work with the Empire’s intelligence agencies to prevent any resurgence of the NMLA or similar terrorist groups.”

It has since been agreed that Imperial Intelligence and the Marlinist Constabulary would collaborate on identifying Neo-Marlinist extremists. Colonel Saskia Landau and Major Milo Castile, both former co-leaders of ACT, have agreed to work together once again.

In recognition of the minority who voted to rejoin the Empire, dedicated customs and immigration channels for registered Marlinist citizens will soon be established.

## 13 APR

### Sirius Defends Alliance Territory

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Sirius Corporation megaships will soon arrive in the Coalsack and Witch Head Nebulas to provide anti-xeno support.

The three vessels are intended as a demonstration of Sirius Corporation’s military capabilities, prior to the strategic defence pact being ratified by the Alliance Assembly.

A public statement was provided by Admiral Nikolas Glass, the Sirius Navy representative on the Alliance Council of Admirals:

“The Coalsack Nebula and Witch Head Nebula regions are where Alliance interests are most at risk from Thargoid attack. From tomorrow, our megaships will serve as bases from which anti-xeno operations can be conducted.”

“All ships in the area are invited to make use of the Song of Mecchi in the Coalsack Sector Vu-O B6-6 system, the Kandula's Truth in the Siniang system, and the Li Chyou Winds in the Onoros system.”

“As a further gesture of our dedication to protecting the Alliance, these megaships will offer a unique pre-engineered heat sink module. We trust that this will prove especially useful to those brave pilots who face the Thargoids in combat.”

## 14 APR

### Support Required for New Marlinist Starports

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

A delivery campaign in the HIP 22550 system will help build additional starports for the Marlinist Colonies.

First Minister Octavia Volkov delivered this public address:

“The Marlinist Colonies were born out of desperation, but we have evolved into a fully fledged society. Emperor Arissa has formally accepted our status as an autonomous democracy, albeit one that retains cultural and historical ties with the Empire.”

“To celebrate and consolidate our independence, we have launched an initiative to construct up to six new orbital stations. For all those who wish to take part, we require shipments of aluminium, computer components, power generators and titanium to be transported to Stillman Hub starport.”

“I am also delighted to announce that Universal Cartographics has approved our petition to rename the original eight systems of the Marlinist Colonies. These are expected to officially change in the near future.”

The Free Marlinists of Carinae faction has confirmed that it will offer rewards to pilots who deliver the necessary materials to Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550 system.

## 15 APR

### Rackham for President?

Multi-billionaire Zachary Rackham has discussed standing as an independent candidate for the Federal presidency in 3309.

The issue was raised during the opening of a new superstructure named Rackham’s Spire on Homeland in the Beta Hydri system. At a press conference in the tropospheric suite, Mr Rackham was asked for his views on the proposed Hudson Contravention.

He replied by light-heartedly hinting that he might run for office himself: “With two Zacharys on the ballot, I’m guaranteed to get some votes by mistake!”

Financial journalist Bryanna Blanco wrote an opinion piece for The Federal Times:

“Rackham’s Spire literally stabs the sky above Los Pioneros, rising so high that during the day its shadow moves across the city like a colossal sundial. Extravagant, expensive and impossible to ignore, it’s practically an altar to the man who built it.”

“I’ve spent half of my career investigating Rackham, and I’m convinced that he always has an ulterior motive. In this case it seems obvious: by laughing off suggestions about standing for election, he makes people expect it to become true. It’s blatantly the first step to a forthcoming campaign.”

“It still mystifies me how Rackham makes people forget his past. Most newsfeeds refuse to acknowledge his former identity as Calico Zack, one of the last century’s most notorious pirates. All they portray is the wealthy and successful businessman – and now, perhaps, a future president of the Federation.”

## 18 APR

### Salvation Strengthens Bonds with Superpowers

The anonymous anti-xeno scientist Salvation has received further military support from the Alliance, Empire and Federation.

Multiple official sources have highlighted the increasing number of crew members being seconded from the Alliance Defence Force, Federal Navy and Imperial Navy. Previously, enlisted members had been forced to resign their commissions, but regulatory changes now permit temporarily serving on vessels owned by Salvation’s commercial partner Taurus Mining Ventures.

One of the recent volunteers, Lieutenant Andrew Jones, was quoted by Vox Galactica:

“Most of us are here because it feels like Salvation is the only one taking the fight to the Thargoids. Now that Aegis is as good as gone, he’s our best hope for stopping these aliens before they wipe us all out.”

Other non-naval recruits from the superpowers are providing support in intelligence, logistics and security. A number of specialists are alleged to be working directly with Salvation on his anti-xeno superweapons, which are derived from Guardian technology.

In related news, scientific research journal The Empirical reported that no evidence of atypical radiation has been detected in the Synuefe CE-R C21-6 system. This has raised questions as to the purpose of Taurus Mining Ventures’s recent mining operation.

## 19 APR

### Yong-Rui: ‘History Will Judge Sirius’

The CEO of Sirius Corporation has addressed public concerns regarding its anti-xeno defence pact with the Alliance.

Li Yong-Rui’s comments were made during an in-depth interview with The Alliance Tribune:

“The best way to predict the future is to study the past. This is as true of interstellar organisations as it is of individuals – our former actions indicate the probability of behaviour. So I invite you to study the role that Sirius Corporation has previously played on the political stage.”

“Ever since the Battle of Achenar and the widespread conflicts of the 2300s, our neutrality has allowed us to mediate between the Empire and the Federation on many occasions. More recently, we defused inter-power tensions by establishing the Marlinist Colonies, which provided permanent homes for millions of refugees.”

“It should also not be overlooked that the Galactic Summit was hosted in the Sirius system, where we encouraged humanity’s leaders to peacefully debate their differences. Furthermore, our development of the frame shift drive has revolutionised exploration and allowed many independent societies to flourish.”

“Some continue to cast aspersions on our strategic partnership with the Alliance, and I fully understand their caution. The fear that corporations can only act self-servingly is born from a millennium of notable examples. But it is history that will judge Sirius Corporation’s efforts to defend and preserve civilisation. I truly hope the Alliance will play a significant role in those efforts.”

## 21 APR

### Marlinist Colonies Receive Starport Resources

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The construction of new Marlinist starports has begun after materials were delivered to the HIP 22550 system.

Enough shipments of aluminium, computer components, power generators and titanium were received at Stillman Hub to facilitate the building of 2 orbital stations. These are expected to become operational by the 5th of May 3308.

The campaign’s conclusion was marked by a statement from First Minister Octavia Volkov:

“Not for the first time in our turbulent history, we are indebted to all pilots who have shown support for the Marlinist Colonies. With these additional starports, we can increase local commerce and contribute to the wider economy.”

“It is my sincere hope that our handful of systems will one day form the nucleus of a Marlinist Republic, which can peacefully co-exist alongside our Imperial cousins.”

The Free Marlinists of Carinae faction is now rewarding all pilots who took part in this initiative at Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550 system.

In related news, Prime Consul Kayode Tau has been invited to establish an office of the Marlinist Consulate on Capitol. This is being widely viewed as a sign of increased diplomatic tolerance from the Emperor.

### Superpower Systems Overrun by Thargoids

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Thargoid fleets have invaded the Didio, Novas and Sosong systems, placing over ten billion lives at risk.

Local security services in all three systems have reported overwhelming numbers of hostile Thargoid vessels. Several starports have been directly attacked with caustic enzyme weapons, and the combined death toll is already in the hundreds of thousands.

Didio, Novas and Sosong are members of the Alliance, Empire and Federation respectively. Three admirals have been selected to mount a defence: Henry Paul Atherton of the Imperial Navy, Maxton Price of the Federal Navy and Rachel Ziegler of the Alliance Defence Force. 

However, it will be days before each can marshal sufficient forces. Therefore the factions Emperor’s Grace, LTT 4772 Alliance Mandate and Union of Sosong Democrats have sent out emergency calls for assistance to all independent pilots.

With Aegis now officially disbanded, its fleet is being temporarily operated by Frontline Solutions. The combat logistics corporation has made the ships available with a volunteer pilot force, which will support the superpowers in systems invaded by Thargoid fleets. Sources indicate a more permanent solution is being sought, as Frontline Solutions CEO Imogen le Ray is believed to be resistant to a long-term commitment of her company’s resources to the anti-xeno effort.

The Alliance, Empire and Federation are currently liaising with Salvation, whose unique weaponry has proved effective against Thargoid incursions of similar magnitude. As yet, Salvation has made no public statement.

## 22 APR

### Rackham Consolidates in Beta Hydri

The Beta Hydri system has become the commercial and political headquarters of wealthy entrepreneur Zachary Rackham.

The Tau Ceti Journal reported that Rackham Capital Investments owns a majority of shares in the Beta Hydri Corporation, the system’s controlling faction. As a member of its board of directors, Rackham has had a role in governing the system for many months.

At a press conference, a spokesperson for Rackham Capital Investments said:

“Mr Rackham was born on the planet Homeland, so he is enthusiastic about giving back to his former community. For example, building Rackham’s Spire helped revive the construction industry in Los Pioneros. We have also invested in several local companies, such as the Luxe Somptueux hotel chain – now rebranded as Rackham’s Rooms – and MacArthur Mining Ltd.”

Several newsfeeds asked if Rackham’s political position in Beta Hydri paved the way for running as an independent candidate in next year’s presidential election. However, the spokesperson declined to comment.

The Federal Times’s coverage of the story included an observation by financial journalist Bryanna Blanco:

“As far as my research can tell, Zachary Rackham’s citizenship documents have never been made public or independently verified. My guess is that Calico Zack wasn’t born in the Federation at all, but hails from some anarchic backwater where piracy is a way of life.”

## 25 APR

### Sirius Vows to Defend Alliance

Sirius Corporation has claimed that the recent Thargoid incursions prove the necessity of its strategic defence pact with the Alliance.

The Didio, Novas and Sosong systems are currently withstanding a coordinated attack from large numbers of Thargoid vessels. Independent pilots have rushed to their aid while the three superpowers prepare their respective fleet responses.

A press conference was held by Admiral Nikolas Glass, the liaison between the Alliance Defence Force and the Sirius Navy:

“This unexpected onslaught only underlines the Alliance’s need for military support. The Thargoids can strike anywhere at any time, and Allied systems such as Didio are vulnerable. Only with Sirius Corporation’s help can we ensure their safety.”

Journalists pointed out that the Council of Admirals had selected Admiral Rachel Ziegler to lead their anti-xeno taskforce instead of Admiral Glass, despite that being his specific area of expertise. He replied:

“Well, as you know, the pact is still within its trial period and hasn’t yet been ratified by the Assembly. So there are limits to how involved Sirius Corporation can be at this stage. I’m sure my colleague will do a fine job while I focus on providing broader support to the Didio system, such as additional secondments to Salvation’s fleet.”

## 26 APR

### Kumo Crew Appoints New Council Leader

Archon Delaine has announced that pirate leader Callan Salamanca is the newest member of the Kumo Council’s upper echelon.

Political journalist Conrad Sterling provided an overview for Vox Galactica:

“The Kumo Council was formed by Archon Delaine to delegate his control over the criminal syndicate. Each member has the title of corsair, and oversees a region or system within his territory. But Delaine’s most trusted advisers, known as arch-corsairs, work with him on strategic goals.”

“The latest addition is the son of Gideon ‘Soulless’ Salamanca, one of the most infamous warlords in the Pegasi sector. Following Salamanca’s unexpected death from a cardiac event, Delaine has elevated Callan to take his father’s place on the council, despite the young man’s reputation for impulsive behaviour.”

“Two others remain in the council’s inner circle. Vidar Trask has been close to Delaine for many years and is known to be an expert administrator. Kay Volantyne was originally part of the Blue Viper Club dredger clan, before she negotiated its alliance with the Kumo Crew.”

“Delaine continues to style himself as the ‘sovereign ruler of the Kumo nation’, striving for an air of legitimacy. The Kumo Council reinforces this approach, but is often called upon to justify or deny their regent’s brutal excesses. With rumours that Callan Salamanca is already misusing his newfound authority, this delicate balance might prove to be unsustainable.”

## 27 APR

### Marlinist Refugees Migrate from Alliance

Over two million ex-Imperial citizens who sought sanctuary with the Alliance are now being repatriated to the Marlinist Colonies.

Ambassador Elijah Beck, head of the Alliance Office of Diplomatic Relations, announced:

“Political refugees from Imperial systems have been arriving since late 3306, following the Empire’s crackdown on Marlinism. At the time they had no legal status or resources, and relied entirely upon the charity of local factions for their survival.”

“Our successful negotiations with the Marlinist Consulate have now led to a solution. The Assembly will fund safe passage to the Marlinist Colonies for all refugees in Allied space. Pending security checks, they will be granted full citizenship.”

The decision was welcomed by First Minister Octavia Volkov:

“Thanks to the Alliance’s generosity, any Marlinists currently within their territory can now take advantage of free transportation to a colony system of their choice. There we will provide state support and work opportunities, to help them establish new permanent homes.”

“More than a million people who fled the Empire are still unaccounted for, having dispersed throughout the core systems. I call for them to contact us via the consulate, and join our growing republican society.”

## 28 APR

### Sirius Initiative Plans Aid for Alliance

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Sirius Corporation has organised humanitarian support for the Didio system, which is under attack by Thargoid vessels.

The Alliance Defence Fleet is currently combating the Thargoid threat in Didio, under the command of Admiral Rachel Ziegler. 

Admiral Nikolas Glass, who acts as a liaison between the megacorp and the Alliance Defence Force, provided details of the campaign:

“With the strategic defence pact yet to be ratified, the Council of Admirals has not approved the deployment of Sirius Navy ships as part of an Allied fleet. However, Sirius Corporation is keen to show its commitment to helping the Alliance, and will do so by supplying vital resources to the Didio system’s besieged population.”

“Large quantities of basic medicines, evacuation shelters and food cartridges are urgently required. These can be delivered to the megaship Chariot of Rhea in the Leesti system, from where they will be delivered to Didio in military convoys.”

Sirius Corporation has been criticised for not providing similar support to the Novas and Sosong systems, which have also been invaded. A spokesperson for the megacorp stated that the strategic defence pact’s trial applies exclusively to the Alliance. Any similar relationship with the Empire and Federation would require separate negotiations, though the spokesperson stressed that Li Yong-Rui has no interest in such talks at this time.

A joint operation between the superpowers is currently underway in Didio, Novas and Sosong to counter recent Thargoid invasions. This is to buy time for Salvation’s anti-xeno superweapons to be constructed.

### Superpowers Employ Pilots to Hunt Thargoids

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The Alliance, Empire and Federation are offering bounties on Thargoid vessels in the Didio, Novas and Sosong systems.

Commodore Morag Halloran, who coordinates Salvation’s military forces, broadcast this message on public channels:

“Salvation has started construction of three anti-xeno superweapons to expunge the latest Thargoid infestation. He estimates two more weeks before these devices become operational. Until that time, it is vital that we keep the Thargoids at bay to minimise civilian casualties.”

The anti-xeno taskforces of the Alliance Defence Force, Federal Navy and Imperial Navy are cooperating on a joint operation to buy time for the superweapons to be completed. This includes rewarding independent pilots for defending the Didio, Novas and Sosong systems.

Commanders can hand in combat bonds for Thargoid kills until the 12th of May 3308 at these three locations: the megaship Plymouth Howl in the Ch'anjie system, Sturckow Orbital in the Lesheima system, and Nusslein-Volhard Settlement in the Zlota system.

Each superpower has also deployed a capital ship to the invaded systems: the Allied megaship Salote Charm in Didio, the Majestic-class interdictor INV Succession in Novas, and the Farragut-class battle cruiser FNS Amphion in Sosong.

Jade Sanderlyn, a reporter for Vox Galactica, has been granted permission to interview the admirals in command of the taskforces. Her conversations with Henry Paul Atherton, Maxton Price and Rachel Ziegler are being broadcast by the capital ships and will be syndicated via newsfeeds.

## 29 APR

### The Sanderlyn Interviews (Part One)

The journalist Jade Sanderlyn of Vox Galactica was recently invited to conduct rare public interviews with admirals of the three superpowers.

This excerpt is from a conversation with Admiral Henry Paul Atherton of the Empire.

Jade Sanderlyn: This is Jade Sanderlyn reporting for Vox Galactica. I am sitting with Admiral Henry Paul Atherton of the Imperial Navy. Thank you for agreeing to this interview, Admiral.

Henry Paul Atherton: Oh, please. Call me Henry.

JS: I’d be delighted to. This is a very impressive ship, Henry.

HPA: Some might say Majestic. [laughs] Yes, the Succession is a wonderful vessel. 

JS: How long have you commanded her?

HPA: Several years now. It has been an honour to have my name listed on the Succession’s exemplary service record. 

JS: You were promoted to admiral only three years ago. Does that change the personal dynamic with your crew at all?

HPA: Well, they salute a little faster, I suppose. Happily I enjoy a strong relationship with my officers, so they took the change fully in stride. 

JS: Let’s talk about Novas. I understand that the Imperial Navy has deployed a fleet here at Salvation’s request.

HPA: That’s correct.

JS: Emperor Arissa recently resumed her duties following… an extended absence from the throne. Having now surely been briefed on Salvation’s work, does the Emperor endorse Salvation?

HPA: If the Emperor had objections, her navy would not be in Novas.

JS: What are your objectives in the system?

HPA: Well, in case it has gone unnoticed, there is a major Thargoid invasion occurring here. It is our duty to protect civilian populations and prevent the loss of strategic assets.

JS: I’m pleased that you mentioned civilian lives first. Does Salvation share this approach?

HPA: Almost certainly. Why else would he invest so much effort into his marvellous superweapon if not to protect people?

JS: Some have claimed that Salvation prioritises victory over safety.

HPA: Jade, dear: they are the same thing. The cost of war is human lives, and the Thargoids extract a heavy toll. Every invaded system. Every burning starport. Every ambushed convoy. Every ship lost to hyperspace. We have repeatedly driven the Thargoids back from our space, but the wretched things keep returning. That cost grows each day. Salvation’s superweapon has proven effective at wiping Thargoids from entire systems at a stroke. If Salvation calls that victory while you and I call it saving lives, then I’m comfortable with the difference in perspective.

JS: Thank you for elaborating. Let’s take a break. We’ll be back after these messages.

The rest of this interview is available to pilots arriving at the INV Succession in the Novas system.

## 30 APR

### The Sanderlyn Interviews (Part Two)

The journalist Jade Sanderlyn of Vox Galactica was recently invited to conduct rare public interviews with admirals of the three superpowers. 

This excerpt is from a conversation with Admiral Maxton Price of the Federation.

Jade Sanderlyn: My name is Jade Sanderlyn, reporting for Vox Galactica. I’m here with Admiral Maxton Price, onboard the FNS Amphion in the Sosong system. I was very impressed with the tour of the ship prior to our interview, Admiral.

Maxton Price: I can’t say I’m surprised, Miss Sanderlyn. Is this your first time on a Farragut-class battle cruiser?

JS: Yes. It’s one the reasons I was so excited that my interview request had been granted. The Amphion is just as impressive as I’d hoped.

MP: That’s gracious of you to say. Of course, the Farragut-class vessels value performance over aesthetics. It’s a lesson our Imperial friends would do well to learn one day.

JS: I take it, then, that you consider yourself a utilitarian?

MP: In military matters, what other philosophy is there? A sleek ship will turn heads and attract investors, but when something dangerous enters your space, most soldiers would choose a powerful response over a pretty one.

JS: Which brings us to the current conflict in this system. The Federal fleet has been asked to contain the Thargoid threat while Salvation prepares his anti-xeno superweapon.

MP: And I have no doubt that we will succeed. Federal military power is as strong as it’s ever been. Funding provided by the Hudson administration over the past seven years has allowed us to expand and modernise our fleet. It’s a pleasant time to be an admiral.

JS: I presume that you are in favour of Salvation’s work.

MP: Wholeheartedly. His results speak volumes to a man like me. The anti-xeno superweapon has incredible range, a devastating impact on Thargoid craft, and is harmless to our own ships. What’s not to like? 

JS: Aside from independent studies by the engineer Ram Tah, we have very limited information about the weapon. We also know nothing about its long-term effects on human physiology. Do you think there is any risk to the public?

MP: Let me ask you a question, Miss Sanderlyn. Do you think this hypothetical health risk poses a greater danger to the general public than a Thargoid fleet crawling through a populated system?

JS: No, but surely the lack of transparency…

MP: No, it does not. I’ve seen what the Thargoids are capable of. It’s impressive, it’s scary and it results in considerable loss of life if not dealt with quickly. Salvation has proven he can achieve significant victories for an entire system. Timid hand-wringing over the future is fine with me, once we’ve secured a future in which to do so.

JS: Let’s take a break for a word from our sponsors. We’ll be right back.

The rest of this interview is available to pilots arriving at the FNS Amphion in the Sosong system.
