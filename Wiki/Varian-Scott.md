### Occupation

President of the Federation

**Varian Scott** served as the President of the Federation from 3144 to 3152.^[1]^^[2]^

Elected in the final years of the First Thargoid War, President Scott leveraged the threat posed by the Thargoids to end military budget restrictions championed by the late Governor Raul Santorini of Tau Ceti in 3022, and launched a project to expand and modernise the Federal Navy. Scott also removed the requirement for military actions to be approved by a vote in Federal Congress in order to improve reaction times to future conflicts. These actions spurred the Empire into modernising its own military forces.^[2]^^[1]^

Scott's presidency also coincided with a period of stagnation and rising discontent within the Galactic Cooperative. By the end of Scott's term in office, both the Federation and the Empire had successfully enticed numerous GalCop member states to join them, reducing GalCop to a fraction of its size.^[2]^
