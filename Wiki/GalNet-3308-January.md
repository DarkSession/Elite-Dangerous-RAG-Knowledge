### Duvals Gather to Celebrate New Year

Princess Aisling Duval marked the start of 3308 by introducing her cousin Hadrian Duval, his wife and their newborn son to Imperial high society.

Entertainment journalist Solomon Helios broadcast a report on the event:

“It’s an annual tradition for Princess Aisling to invite the great and the good to her palace on Emerald, although the tragic loss of her father in 3306 meant that last year’s gathering was cancelled. This year she made up for it with a sumptuous, glittering celebration of the kind that we Imperials are famed for.”

“For the first time, Hadrian Duval and Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval were in attendance. This youthful couple were surprisingly charming for a pair who would once have been arrested on sight. They entertained guests with stories of trading and fighting aboard tiny ships, from the days when their only title was Commander.”

“However, the real guest of honour spent most of his time asleep, oblivious to the colossal attention he drew. Yes, baby Hector made his very first public appearance, having been born while his parents were under senatorial protection. Many dignitaries insisted on having their image recorded beside the ‘future Emperor’, a phrase one could hear being murmured throughout the palace.”

“But what of the current Emperor? Unlike Hadrian’s family, Arissa Lavigny-Duval remains in seclusion and only communicates remotely with the Senate. Now that the terrorists have been quelled, surely the time has come for Her Imperial Majesty to reappear before her loyal subjects?”

## 02 JAN

### A Retrospective of 3307 (Part Three)

Sima Kalhana reviews the most newsworthy events of the past year in this series of articles.

“July began badly for the Federation, with more factions seceding in response to the Proactive Detection Bureau’s establishment. The newly independent nations severed all links with these new surveillance efforts, inspiring many other systems to do likewise. This secession crisis would rumble on for the rest of the year.”

“The Blue Viper Club, one of the rarely seen dredger clans, joined forces with the Kumo Crew to manufacture a medicinal drug that turned out to be a new strain of onionhead. The drug would ultimately end up being legally distributed by Neomedical Industries, causing Archon Delaine to seek revenge against the corporation.”

“Tensions soared in the Marlinist Colonies during an election for the head of their diplomatic consulate. Aaron Whyte’s candidate had the support of an Imperial senator, which would have given the Neo-Marlinists a powerful voice within the Empire.”

“When a more moderate candidate was elected, the NMLA reacted by bombing both Marlinist starports, murdering tens of thousands including First Minister Jenna Fairfax. It seemed Theta Seven’s extremist views allowed anyone to be targeted as an enemy, even his fellow Marlinists. The civil war concluded in August, with Whyte killed in battle as his supporters were overcome in direct combat.”

“Following accusations of incompetence regarding the vanished Alexandria megaship, Aegis was officially suspended and subjected to a board of inquiry. This would have ramifications for the ongoing conflict with the Thargoids, and encourage Salvation to position himself as an alternative.”

“In the corporate sphere, Zemina Torval created a new subsidiary of Mastopolos Mining that would eventually become an autonomous company. There were rumours that the Torval and Mastopolos families were now at loggerheads after decades of working in unison.”

“In September, the mystery of Hyford’s Cache was finally unlocked. The trail led to revelations of dark experiments which are believed to have involved human test subjects and Thargoid technology.”

“When the Thargoids themselves appeared en masse in the Cornsar system, Salvation was ready for them. An anti-xeno superweapon of undisclosed nature was deployed, wiping out some of the aliens and driving away the rest. It seemed that the self-titled ‘man of science’ had developed something revolutionary, inspiring many to place their faith in him to end the Thargoid menace once and for all.”

## 03 JAN

### Alliance and Sirius Agree Defence Pact

Sirius Corporation has signed an agreement to provide the Alliance with ships, materials and personnel to help combat the Thargoids.

The Alliance Assembly and the Council of Admirals held a rare joint vote on the issue of inviting the megacorp to become a strategic defence partner. The motion was debated in private and reportedly passed by a slim majority.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon told The Alliance Tribune:

“The danger posed by the Thargoids is increasing once more, perhaps accelerated by the loss of Aegis and a lack of any binding treaty between the superpowers. It is vital that we make a proactive decision to maintain security for Alliance systems.”

“Sirius Corporation will work closely with the Alliance Defence Force to reinforce our member vessels, focusing exclusively on anti-xeno operations. In return, new commercial agreements will provide the company with increased access to certain financial endeavours.”

Councillor Nakato Kaine spoke on behalf of several disapproving members of the Assembly:

“We are already too entwined with this ruthless corporate giant, so to hand our defences over to them is another blow to the Alliance’s identity. It is also convenient that the details of the pact remain classified under military restrictions. We don’t even know what price we’re paying to hire Sirius to be our guard dog.”

## 04 JAN

### Whistleblower Reveals Imperial Link to NMLA

A potential connection between the NMLA’s dark-comms network and Imperial Intelligence has been made public by one of ACT’s co-leaders.

Captain Saskia Landau sent a personal statement to all major media outlets:

“The majority of my career has been with the Imperial Internal Security Service, but I was seconded for a year to a classified project run by Imperial Intelligence. To coordinate their operations, they use a sophisticated communications system known as the Omega Grid. This is designed to avoid detection or interception by enemies of the Empire.”

“I have reviewed ACT’s research into the NMLA’s dark-comms network and can verify its similarity to Omega Grid technology. Since this is exclusively under Imperial Intelligence’s control, it suggests that an individual or group within the organisation was making it available to the NMLA.”

“I’m aware that revealing this information publicly may end my career or even endanger my life. Nevertheless, I have shared my findings with ACT’s leadership, and call upon the Imperial Senate to open an independent investigation into this evidence.”

As yet there has been no response from Imperial Intelligence or the Senate. However, several agents of the IISS have anonymously spoken to reporters from The Imperial Herald, verifying that the Omega Grid system does exist and has been in use for many years.

## 05 JAN

### Ram Tah's Revelations Halt Court Martial

The military trial of Admiral Aden Tanner has been suspended following evidence provided by Ram Tah as a witness for the defence.

The Federal Navy tribunal was called to consider multiple charges – including mutiny – held against Tanner, the chief military liaison to Aegis. While commanding the Musashi megaship, he attempted to gain access to Hind Mine station and locate evidence regarding Salvation’s anti-xeno superweapon.

Admiral Tanner’s defence attorney opened a live link with Phoenix Base to allow Ram Tah to provide the following testimony:

“We have analysed the classified experimental equipment that was recently delivered to enable Salvation’s superweapons. These components are near-identical to devices found at the Proteus research facility on Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2. In 3113, an Azimuth Biochemicals science team conducted weapons testing using Guardian artefacts from this site, accidentally triggering a radiation surge which resulted in their deaths.”

“My hypothesis is that Salvation has constructed large-scale versions of the Proteus design. These generate a powerful electromagnetic pulse at frequencies which disrupt the Thargoids’ bio-mechanical technology.”

“It’s highly probable that this is based on an existing Guardian weapon discovered by the Proteus. This would explain why its presence within a system attracts Thargoid vessels.”

The Federal Navy Criminal Court announced that Admiral Tanner’s court martial has been temporarily suspended while the new evidence is reviewed.

## 06 JAN

### Colonia Bridge Project Launches Phase Three

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Brewer Corporation intends to improve the travel corridor between the Alcor and Colonia systems by constructing several new starports.

The previous two phases of the Colonia Bridge project established stationary megaships in 56 systems. These provide rest, refuel and repair facilities for vessels making the 22,000 light year journey to and from the Colonia region. The additional infrastructure has also increased the amount of tritium available at these markets, easing the journey for capital-size ships.

A press release from Brewer Corporation outlined this latest initiative:

“Phase three aims to enhance the Colonia Bridge by building permanent starports in key locations along the route. These will offer a wide range of services to travellers, and also serve as homes for the many new communities that we expect to spring up around them.”

“Our plan is to construct one starport in the vicinity of Colonia, and up to five starports stretching out from Alcor. Station structures will be assembled by the 27th of January, with additional services scheduled for implementation at a later date.”

“Pilots are asked to deliver ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units to Jaques Station in the Colonia system and Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system.”

“Assuming deliveries reach the required level, engineered frame shift drives will once again be available as rewards.”

“The highest contributor in Colonia, and up to the top five contributors in Alcor, will be invited to submit naming suggestions for the new starports. All name submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors.”

## 07 JAN

### Imperial Intelligence Denies NMLA Connection

Senators have refuted ACT’s claim that the NMLA made use of official but highly secret Imperial communications devices.

Captain Saskia Landau maintains that the terrorist group’s dark-comms network was very similar to the Omega Grid, an undetectable messaging system used exclusively by Imperial Intelligence.

Senator Karl Nerva told the media:

“In her desperation to seek out the NMLA, Captain Landau is chasing shadows. Imperial Intelligence must operate under total secrecy, but I assure you that this ‘Omega Grid’ is just as much of an invention to discredit the Empire as Serene Harbour was.”

“Landau has overstepped her authority with these outlandish accusations. I once again propose that ACT be disbanded and its operatives returned to normal duties.”

The Imperial Herald reported that other senators are calling for Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval to overrule those who are blocking ACT’s investigation. The newsfeed highlighted that she did not attend any functions in person during the past year, and has not broadcast any public messages.

In response, Chancellor Anders Blaine gave this statement:

“Her Majesty was placed under secure protection in early 3307 after several failed assassination attempts by the NMLA. She has been communicating remotely with the Senate on all official business, but does plan to return to Capitol very soon.”

## 10 JAN

### Sirius Navy Unites with Alliance Defence Force

A new member has been appointed to the Council of Admirals to represent Sirius Corporation as the Alliance’s strategic defence partner.

Political correspondent Vanya Driscoll reported for The Alliance Tribune:

“There are always six seats on the Council of Admirals, taken by senior military commanders from the largest regional fleets. Not only is this the first time that a seventh position has been created, it’s also the first to come from outside the Alliance.”

“The new addition is Admiral Nikolas Glass, a highly decorated officer with the Sirius Navy. His new role is to coordinate the Alliance’s anti-Thargoid operations, which from now on will be directly supported by Sirius Corporation.”

“Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Fleet Admiral Hayley Sorokin both endorsed this development as a way of strengthening the Alliance Defence Force, which lacks the might of the Federal or Imperial Navy. Many member systems have demanded increased protection against the Thargoid threat, so this news is likely to be well received.”

“As expected, Councillor Nakato Kaine opposed the defence pact, with Admiral George Varma also critical of ‘merging commercial interests with military matters’. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran also admitted that she abstained during the recent joint vote, but chose not to elaborate on her reasons. So it seems that the Assembly is not fully confident about this union with Sirius Corporation.”

## 11 JAN

### Torval Mining Challenges Caine-Massey

The company owned by Senator Zemina Torval is attempting to acquire a mining contract previously awarded to the Caine-Massey corporation.

The agreement affects multiple corporations on the fringes of Federal space around the Dulos system, who for the last decade have purchased mined ore and other raw materials directly from Caine-Massey. With the contract up for renewal, Torval Mining Ltd has made an official bid.

An announcement was made by Constantia Torval, the company’s operations director and daughter of Zemina Torval:

“We have enjoyed enormous success in a short space of time by providing services to the Empire. This is an opportunity to reach a broader customer base, and convince them that they too can benefit from Torval Mining’s expertise.”

Johann Fleischer, the vice president of Caine-Massey, remarked:

“Our corporation is proud of its origins within the Federation, and we have supplied these systems with resources for many years. This is a surreptitious attempt by an Imperial senator to boost her own standing by hijacking Federal business.”

The Federal Commerce Authority has responded to Caine-Massey’s request for intervention. An initial review found that, while it recognises the aggression of the Torval Mining claims, there is no exclusivity clause in place that prevents the companies in question from holding talks with an Imperial supplier now Caine-Massey’s contract term is expiring.

## 12 JAN

### Baumann Report: 'Dismantle Aegis'

The independent inquiry into Aegis has delivered its final conclusions and recommended that the organisation be closed down.

Dr Paul Baumann, who chaired the board of inquiry, summarised the detailed report:

“Aegis was established on solid foundations in 3303 with strong leadership. Over the years, poor mid-level management and general negligence reduced its effectiveness. A silo mentality developed, with each department focusing on itself rather than strategic goals.”

“Reduced funding undoubtedly contributed to low morale among staff and a lack of any further breakthroughs in AX technology. But a reliance on independent pilots to combat the Thargoids became normalised, with some staff considering them ‘disposable mercenaries’.”

“More specifically, the loss of the megaship Alexandria and the illegal attack against Hind Mine are both catastrophes that could have been anticipated and prevented. This board cannot in all conscience recommend any scenario that might enable further loss of life in Aegis’s name.”

Observers have noted that the Baumann Report, as it is commonly referred to, does not discuss Salvation or suggest methods of replacing Aegis.

In related news, the court martial of Admiral Aden Tanner has concluded with a verdict of guilty and a dishonourable discharge from the Federal Navy. However, his sentencing has been postponed by request from newly promoted Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori, who has ordered a full review of evidence provided by Ram Tah.

## 13 JAN

### Materials Delivered for Colonia Bridge Starports

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The third phase of Brewer Corporation’s Colonia Bridge project has proven successful, according to a recent announcement.

Shipments of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units were transported in large numbers to Jaques Station in the Colonia system and Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system. As a result, several new starports will be constructed along the travel corridor to Colonia.

Brewer Corporation released this statement regarding the initiative:

“Once again, we owe a great deal to the pilots who brought us so many vital resources. We can now proceed with constructing one starport in the vicinity of Colonia and 5 starports in systems branching out from Alcor. These will increase the value of the Colonia Bridge for travellers, tourists and commercial interests alike.”

“The starport infrastructures are scheduled to be built by the 27th of January. Initially they will provide rearm, refuel and repair services, but will lack markets and other facilities. The distances involved in ferrying equipment to these locations means that these starports will become fully operational in stages over a period of weeks.”

“Contributors will be able to collect their rewards from Jaques Station and Macdonald Settlement from the 14th of January. The proposed engineered frame shift drives for those eligible will follow at a later date. The dedicated pilots who provided the most deliveries in Alcor and Colonia will receive invitations to submit suggestions to name the new starports, subject to review.”

### Corporations Compete for Mining Contract

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Caine-Massey and Torval Mining Ltd are running rival campaigns to deliver mined commodities to the Dulos system.

For the past decade, the megacorp Caine-Massey has supplied ore and other raw materials to several subsidiaries in the region. But with the contract up for renewal, Torval Mining Ltd is making a bid for the lucrative business.

Constantia Torval, operations director for the Empire-based company, outlined the initiative:

“We are calling upon pilots to provide the following mined materials: bromellite, samarium and gallite. These should be delivered to the Pride of Bitterwood in the Dulos system. Your assistance will directly support our proposal to win this contract and expand our entire enterprise.”

Caine-Massey published a similar request from its vice president, Johann Fleischer:

“The citizens within this region deserve a high standard of service, and we aim to continue meeting their needs. The Green Party of Dulos, acting on our behalf, shall offer generous rewards for shipments of mined bromellite, samarium and gallite delivered to Smith Port in the Dulos system.”

The corporate distributors within the region have agreed that whichever candidate is able to provide the greatest amount of materials will be awarded the contract for the next decade.

## 14 JAN

### Sirius Gov Enters the Alioth System

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has invited Sirius Corporation to establish a permanent presence within the Alliance.

The Alliance Tribune’s political correspondent Vanya Driscoll reported:

“Sirius Corporation’s new role as a strategic defence partner has expanded swiftly, with a Sirius faction established in the Alioth system to represent the megacorp. In addition, several megaships have arrived in other Allied systems to provide support.”

“The Alliance Defence Force and some government departments now have official advisors from Sirius Corporation on their staff. Prime Minister Mahon announced that these developments will streamline joint operations with the Sirius Navy, and in turn provide effective countermeasures against Thargoid aggression.”

“But Councillor Nakato Kaine claims that the presence of Sirius Gov is illegal as it was not ratified by the Assembly. She has pointed out that since the defence pact makes this a classified military matter, any civil action to reverse Mahon’s executive decision has been deliberately blocked.”

## 17 JAN

### Senate Blocks ACT Investigation

There are claims that the Imperial Senate is preventing efforts to examine a potential link between the Empire’s security services and the NMLA.

Captain Saskia Landau has publicly stated that the terrorists’ dark-comms network is closely related to the Omega Grid system used exclusively by Imperial Intelligence. She expanded on her theory in a statement to Vox Galactica:

“Based on evidence and interrogation transcripts obtained by ACT, I believe that rogue elements within Imperial Intelligence were training and providing equipment to the NMLA. This would help explain the level of sophistication they achieved in coordinating their starport attacks and communicating without detection.”

“There is certainly enough circumstantial proof to warrant a dedicated investigation. But the Senate is refusing to authorise this, which makes me wonder what they are trying to hide.”

Senator Karl Nerva reiterated: “It is time for ACT to devolve and return much-needed resources to the Empire where they belong.”

However, Senator Caspian Leopold responded: “To alleviate any lack of confidence in our security services, we should examine Captain Landau’s allegation rigorously. Our citizens must be reassured that Imperial Intelligence exists solely for their protection.”

## 18 JAN

### Superpowers Plan to Replace Aegis

The Alliance, Empire and Federation have accepted the Baumann Report’s recommendation to permanently shut down Aegis.

The independent inquiry’s findings on the organisation’s failings will result in Aegis being immediately shut down. However, Chief Administrator Carter Armstrong has cautioned that “full demobilisation of staff, ships and resources might take several months”.

Senator Denton Patreus has successfully obtained senatorial approval for an increased military budget, to allow the Imperial Navy to directly take on the role played by Aegis.

Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori likewise confirmed that the Federal Congress has ordered the creation of a new naval strike force. On his own authority he has also commissioned an investigation into Salvation, following Ram Tah’s testimony regarding the nature of the anti-xeno superweapon.

Admiral Nikolas Glass, who was recently appointed to the Council of Admirals, stated that the Alliance Defence Force and Sirius Navy will work in conjunction to fulfil Aegis’s purpose.

Xenological research laboratories set up by Professor Alba Tesreau will now transfer their work to specialist departments in the Holloway Bioscience Institute, Imperial Science Academy and Olympus Village University. In 3304 the Thargoids made targeted strikes against Aegis’s labs, but all three institutions have made assurances that the new locations will have the highest security.

## 20 JAN

### Caine-Massey Wins Mining Contract

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The Caine-Massey corporation has beaten Torval Mining Ltd to retain a mining contract in the Dulos system.

Competing campaigns were waged by the two rivals for the rights to supply ore and mined materials to many local subsidiaries.

Johann Fleischer, vice president of Caine-Massey, declared their victory:

“We wish to thank the large number of pilots who delivered bromellite, samarium and gallite. Thanks to your hard work, our contract has been renewed for another decade. I like to think that we have also secured the honour of the Federation by stalling the Empire’s plans.”

Rewards for contributors to Caine-Massey are now available for collection at Smith Port in the Dulos system.

Torval Mining Ltd also received many deliveries of materials but in insufficient quantities to secure the contract. Constantia Torval has confirmed that the pilots who supported their initiative can collect payment at the Pride of Bitterwood megaship.

### The Missing Emperor?

Princess Aisling Duval has discussed growing concerns over Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval’s lack of public engagements in recent months.

In an interview with The Imperial Herald, she said:

“Chancellor Blaine assures us that the Emperor has been kept in seclusion for nearly a year to protect her from the NMLA. But why has this prevented the Empire’s ruler from engaging with her citizens? After all, Hadrian Duval and his family were placed under the same senatorial protection without disappearing altogether.”

“We know that the Emperor has communicated with the Senate on various matters during this time. Government channels are generally trusted thanks to Imperial Intelligence’s verification protocols. But Captain Landau’s recent testimony, which links Imperial Intelligence to the NMLA, has me concerned. How can I be sure that a breach to our most secure networks wasn’t responsible for the location and murder of my father, Prince Harold?”

“Until Arissa appears in person, it is irresponsible to assume her safety is guaranteed. I will be most relieved to have my fears proved wrong.”

Chancellor Anders Blaine responded:

“With the greatest respect to Princess Duval, I have never had cause to believe that Her Majesty the Emperor is in any danger from her own security agencies. Her imminent return to public life should alleviate such concerns.”

## 21 JAN

### Federal Government Plans for the Future

President Zachary Hudson has delivered a speech to Congress on maintaining security for the Federation in the coming years.

Excerpts from his address include the following:

“In the last year, we have excelled at protecting Federal citizens from harm. The Proactive Detection Bureau proved its worth in locating terrorists before they could strike, and our security services played an instrumental role in the NMLA’s defeat.”

“3308 is already bringing many challenges. The war against the Thargoids could escalate at any time, and we face the challenge of replacing Aegis with our own anti-xeno taskforce. We are also deeply concerned about increased infighting within the Alliance and Empire, which could easily spill over into our territory.”

“My administration is holding high-level discussions about how best to keep the Federation strong and secure. We will soon make some brave proposals to continue meeting our people’s constitutional right to safety.”

Shadow President Felicia Winters delivered this rebuttal:

“President Hudson fails to mention his disastrous attempt to capture Yuri Grom, his former fleet admiral’s criminal conviction for destroying Starship One, or that his surveillance laws forced several systems to declare independence. I would argue that under his leadership, the Federation has never been weaker or less secure.”

## 22 JAN

### The Return of the Alexandria

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The Aegis megaship Alexandria, which vanished in hyperspace seven months ago, has been found in the Wregoe TC-X B29-0 system.

A select group of independent pilots located the Alexandria following a search instigated by Professor Alba Tesreau, former head of research at Aegis. She was forced to resign as a result of the Baumann Report, which was instigated by the controversial loss of this megaship.

In June 3307, the Alexandria was pursued by Thargoid vessels due to a considerable number of Guardian artefacts held on board. It initiated a hyperspace jump to the HIP 30944 system to offload its cargo but never arrived. The megaship was assumed to have been hyperdicted by the Thargoids, resulting in the death of all four thousand crewmembers.

According to on-site witnesses, the remains of the Alexandria are currently scattered across the planetary rings of Wregoe TC-X b29-0 AB 2 A. Ships are investigating the debris, but so far have not reported finding any survivors or Guardian relics.

Chief Administrator Carter Armstrong made a public statement:

“Losing the Alexandria was as tragic as it was mysterious, but we now have an opportunity to learn what happened. Aegis should remain operational until a full analysis has been completed and we can understand the cause of the megaship’s destruction.”

## 24 JAN

### Reorte Resists Sirius Corporation

The presence of Sirius Corporation in the Reorte system at the Alliance’s invitation has been challenged by the controlling faction.

In its new role as a strategic defence partner, Sirius Corporation recently established itself in several Alliance systems. But its megaship in Reorte, Chariot of Rhea, has found itself blockaded by system security and refused permission to offload cargo or personnel.

A broadcast was made by Fergus Cassidy, CEO of the Reorte Mining Coalition:

“Councillor Kaine is right to say that Sirius is acting illegally. The prime minister did not consult us or any other Allied faction on working with them, and there’s good reason to be sceptical of their motives. We regard the Chariot of Rhea as an intruder and insist that it leaves immediately.”

Li Yong-Rui has assured Alliance leaders that Sirius Corporation will only be collaborating on anti-Thargoid defence projects. He stressed that there will be no disruption to any local civil or commercial activity.

The Alliance Tribune commented on the situation:

“Many Allied systems welcomed the news that our military is being bolstered by Sirius Corporation. But others expressed disapproval, particularly among the Old Worlds where the populations tend to be more sceptical of change. What happens in Reorte could determine whether or not the new defence pact becomes widely accepted.”

## 26 JAN

### Arissa Addresses the Empire

The Imperial Senate has shared a personal message from Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval, who has been in a secure location for nearly a year.

The brief statement was broadcast on all public channels:

“Citizens of the Empire, be assured that your Emperor is alive and well. I regret that my temporary seclusion has lasted for so long, but I have remained in contact with the Senate during this time.”

“I was advised to depart from Capitol when Imperial Intelligence warned me about a legitimate NMLA assassination attempt, and of Marlinist sympathisers within the highest levels of our government. Once the work of this loyal agency is complete, I will continue my work in leading us toward a prosperous future.”

Eye on Achenar reported that this address was “welcomed by a relieved Empire”, adding that it was vital to “root out all Marlinist traitors”. The Imperial Herald noted that the Emperor seemed to absolve Imperial Intelligence of the allegations that it was secretly enabling the NMLA.

However, a caution was sounded by Princess Aisling Duval:

“Arissa has communicated with the Senate in the same manner for months, so this changes nothing. Only a public appearance will alleviate my concerns regarding her wellbeing. I would be delighted to host a suitable event if she will accept my invitation to attend in person.”

## 27 JAN

### Conflict Erupts in the Reorte System

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The Reorte Mining Coalition has declared its intent to remove the Sirius Corporation presence from its home system.

The megaship Chariot of Rhea arrived in Reorte as part of Sirius Corporation’s new role as the Alliance’s strategic defence partner. But the system’s controlling faction ordered it to withdraw. The megaship’s non-compliance has resulted in skirmishes targeting Sirius forces.

Fergus Cassidy, CEO of the Reorte Mining Coalition, announced:

“We fully support Councillor Kaine’s position that Sirius Corporation is operating illegally under Alliance law. Therefore, we will defend our territory from this aggressive foreign entity.”

A response was broadcast by Captain Delfina Dominguez of the Sirius Navy, who commands the Chariot of Rhea:

“Our presence is authorised by the military contract between Sirius Corporation and the Alliance Defence Force. If local forces continue to attack, we will have no option but to defend our assets.”

The fighting is not believed to have reached surface level and is expected to remain a ship-based conflict.

To rally support from independent pilots, both factions are offering access to permit-locked systems. Reorte Mining Coalition will sponsor distribution of an Alioth system permit, while Sirius Corporation will authorise a permit to the Sirius system.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has ordered the Reorte Mining Coalition to cease hostilities immediately. However, Councillor Ainsley Niven – who represents Reorte in the Assembly and is a political supporter of Nakato Kaine – claims that the faction has the right to protect its territory, since it was not invited to ratify the defence pact.

## 28 JAN

### New Starports Created for Colonia Bridge

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The infrastructures of six starports have been completed along the travel corridor between Colonia and the core systems.

Brewer Corporation has confirmed that five starport frames were constructed in systems branching out from Alcor, with a sixth closer to the Colonia system. The new stations are:

Zerreiss Station in the Pru Euq WO-D b53-8 system

Helgrind Gateway in the NGC 6530 Sector ZE-X b2-0 system

Vladmir McDoogle's Triumph in the Flyiedge VN-W c4-51 system

Canonn Complex in the Prua Phoe MI-B b17-5 system

Venatores Hub in the Blua Eaec WW-E c14-1293 system

Promium Relay in the Eoch Flyuae QK-E d12-2118 system

At present the starports are not fully operational and only provide rearm, refuel and repair services. Basic commodity trading has also been established to accommodate pilots selling construction materials and to supply tritium fuel.

A fourth phase of the Colonia Bridge project is scheduled to begin on the 10th of February, which will aim to complete construction and add a broader range of facilities.

Brewer Corporation was able to meet all of its targets for phase three due to the considerable amount of raw materials delivered by the galactic community. The names of the new starports were selected by those pilots who made the greatest contributions to the initiative.

## 31 JAN

### 'Azimuth has Survived' Warns Aegis

Information recovered from the Alexandria has prompted Aegis to insist that it was not responsible for the loss of the megaship’s crew and cargo.

The wreckage of the Alexandria was recently located in the Wregoe TC-X B29-0 system. There were no survivors, but fragments of the commanding officer’s log were found.

Chief Administrator Carter Armstrong published this statement on behalf of Aegis:

“The logs made by Captain Jacob Morales tell a bleak tale. The Alexandria was deliberately sabotaged to leave it stranded and powerless. They were met by an unidentified group posing as a rescue team, who slaughtered most of the crew and hijacked the Guardian artefacts. The survivors later made a desperate attempt to initiate the hyperdrive, which sadly led to their destruction.”

“We can now prove that the Alexandria’s loss was not caused by negligence, as claimed by the Baumann Report. In reality, the megaship was snared in a trap laid by an organised quasi-military force.”
