## Notes

- According to the system description for Eravarenth, the system's inhabitants believe that a descendant of Peter Jameson lives there or somewhere nearby. Given Eravarenth's proximity to Shinrarta Dezhra, it is possible this rumour refers to Lori Jameson.^[4]^
- The terrorist Riri McAllister, former leader of the dismantled League of Reparation, believed that she was a direct descendant of John Jameson. Her claims were never verified, as she was registered as an orphan of unknown lineage and disappeared while being transported to a medical facility for treatment.^[5]^^[6]^
