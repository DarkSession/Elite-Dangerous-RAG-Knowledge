**Hors** is a Federal system controlled by the independent group Clan of Hors in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It is also the headquarters of Brightlight Training. 

Access to Hors is restricted, and requires a permit that can only be obtained by achieving the Federal Navy Auxiliary rank of Post Commander. The permit lock was put in place to protect and limit the external impact on the unique millennium-old social structure of the Clan of Hors, as a social experiment conducted by the Federation.

In the ancient Earth language of French, 'Hors' translates to 'outside,' symbolising a system positioned beyond the grasp of the Federation's influence. This interpretation aligns seamlessly with the Clan of Hors's perspective on why the system received its name.

The Clan of Hors affectionately designates their home planet as Yasha, a term deeply resonant with the profound concept of "Saviour" in a language long obscured by the passage of time. This evocative nomenclature carries poignant echoes of their ancestors' exodus from captivity—a liberating journey etched into the very fabric of their cultural memory. It led them to an uninhabited world, a sanctuary from their past.

However, the interstellar charts adopted by the Federation have bestowed upon the planet the rather puzzling name of Colon. This designation perplexes and unsettles the Clan of Hors. While speculation abounds regarding a potential connection to the Federation's bureaucratic connotations, the true origins of this name remain enigmatic, shrouded in mystery. Consequently, the planet now bears a title that starkly contradicts the cultural essence and significance held dear by its inhabitants.
