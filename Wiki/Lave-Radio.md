Lave Radio is also an in-game Sidewinder located near the planet Lave in the Lave system. Players approaching the Sidewinder will hear a Lave Radio broadcast: *"An orange sidewinder, hosted by a vending machine technician."*

Shooting the ship will provoke the transmission: *"All you'll hear is Radio Boom Boom! Radio Pew Pew! Radio it's true. Lave Radio just shot you."* The attacker will be tagged with a bounty and system security will be alerted.^[2]^
