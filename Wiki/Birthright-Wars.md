The **Birthright Wars** were a series of conflicts between Federation-backed corporations and Federal colonists that occurred between 2621 and 2735. They entailed a struggle for hereditary "birthright claims" to tracts of land on colonial worlds. While these lands and worlds had been settled by individual pioneers who passed their claims and charters to generations of their descendants, only corporations possessed the technology necessary to exploit the resources within those claims, and violence erupted as the corporations pressed to acquire ownership of the colonists' claims or negate their charters. By the end of the Birthright Wars, the corporations had largely prevailed, and the Federal Navy had restructured itself into a modern, centralised military force, but the Federation's reputation was badly tarnished.

## Background

Between 2621 and 2735, Federal member systems underwent a period of societal change. The original colonial charters of many settlements granted hereditary land and position to families descended from their original settlers. Many of these birthright claims extended across vast areas of land and encompassed enormous concentrations of raw resources. The old charters became a hindrance to corporations who wanted access to these assets, and gradually more and more pressure came to bear on the presidency to take action against this "stifling anachronism".^[1]^ This came at a time when the Federation was acquiring new member systems at a steady rate, which inflated the size of Federal Congress. As a result, Congress became increasingly unable to arrive at a consensus on many issues, which in turn indirectly delegated more authority to the president. Amid this political quagmire, corporations were emboldened to act on their own, and often gained backing from the Federal government based on promises of ample economic benefits.^[2]^

## Events

The Birthright Wars were instigated by the forced acquisition of hereditary territorial rights from colonial pioneers by corporations. The colonists viewed this as a corrupt and unlawful act of aggression, while the corporations dressed the seizures in such terms as "redistribution", "reclamation", and "progress". While the corporations never received direct assistance from Federal Navy, they managed to obtain backing from the Federal government to strip Federal landowners of their holdings by force.^[1]^^[2]^

Simultaneously with the Birthright Wars, a commercial race in starship innovation together with increased funding from the corporations allowed the Federation to renew and centralise its military power. In the past, mobilising a fleet had required mustering resources from each member system, but generous corporate charters authorised different corporations to build and maintain centralised fleets, which could be deployed much more efficiently against the Federation's enemies. The first of these fleets was commissioned and trained at Anlave in 2702. Anlave was also chosen to host the first military training facility outside of the Federation's central systems, providing a much needed new purpose for an agricultural system that had been on the decline.^[3]^^[2]^

Not long after the Federal Navy's restructuring, Anlave served as the site of last significant battle of the Birthright Wars. Exiled descendants of displaced original colonists banded together and invaded the system in 2708, bombarding and obliterating the Naval Academy on the planet Anderton. A fleet of privateers aligned with the colonists then descended on the system to pillage, but were beaten back by Federal Navy Admiral Ghenkis B'nami, a spirited and shrewd tactician. It was believed at the time that the assault on Anlave had been funded by the Empire, but no link was ever proven, and later historians would view the assertion as scaremongering. Colonial holdouts continued to resist corporate landgrabs after Anlave, but did not have the strength to muster another cohesive counterattack. The Birthright Wars were considered to have ended in 2735.^[3]^^[2]^

## Impact

The two main legacies of the Birthright Wars were the irrevocable permeation of corporate influence throughout the Federal government, and the centralisation of the previously localised Federal Navy. Although many corporations that had enlisted the Federal government's assistance in pressing their claims to colonial resources had promised vast economic gains in return, the protracted struggle for territory left most of the affected colonies diminished and markedly less productive than when they had been under hereditary control. Furthermore, the majority of corporate proceeds from their new acquisitions was invested into the Federal Navy rather than the Federal economy. The conflicts also resulted in the displacement and disillusionment of many Federal citizens, who would go on to resettle in frontier systems that would one day join the Alliance; among these refugees was the industrialist Walter Argent of Ayethi, who took his family and what wealth he could salvage to Alioth. Centuries after the fact, the Birthright Wars were regarded an especially shameful period in the Federation's history.^[4]^^[2]^
