# Elite: The Dark Wheel
The Dark Wheel novella
 		 	 

**Elite: The Dark Wheel** is a 48 page novella by the well-known fantasy author Robert Holdstock. It came packaged with the original Elite game in 1984. Incidentally, it was the first novella in history to be included for distribution with a video game.^[1]^

The novella accurately sets the mood and atmosphere of the Elite series in a cohesive manner. It covers combat and trading between different systems and describes what it really means to become one of the Elite.

The back of the BBC novella states that a sequel was planned for publication in 1985, but this apparently never came to fruition. Later editions of The Dark Wheel, included in the Sinclair Spectrum and Commodore 64 versions among others, sported new artwork.^[2]^
