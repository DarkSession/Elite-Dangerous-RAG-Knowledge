**Aden Tanner** was an Admiral in the Federal Navy, the Chief of Federal Security, and the Chief Military Liaison for Aegis. A seasoned and internationally respected military leader with over four decades of experience in the Federal Navy, Tanner was appointed Chief of Federal Security on April 7, 3303 ostensibly to investigate Thargoid activity, a move which prompted media outlets to nickname him "the alien tsar".^[2]^ Tanner was subsequently appointed Chief Military Liaison for the multinational anti-Thargoid research organization Aegis on August 19, 3303,^[3]^ making him the leading human military authority in the Second Thargoid War.

In November 3307, Tanner commandeered the Aegis Defense megaship Musashi and led an attack on Hind Mine in T Tauri, the headquarters of Taurus Mining Ventures, a corporation under contract with the mysterious Salvation. In carrying out the illegal attack, Tanner claimed that Hind Mine contained evidence that Salvation's new anti-xeno superweapons were deliberately provoking the Thargoids and endangering human colonies. Aegis disavowed Tanner's actions and ordered him to return. Taurus Mining Ventures later routed Tanner's forces. Tanner himself was arrested and transferred into the custody of Aegis, then court-martialed by the Federal Navy Criminal Court. On January 12, 3308, Tanner was found guilty and dishonourably discharged from the Federal Navy.

Following the various revelations that Salvation had ordered the attack on the Aegis Megaship Alexandria, and that Taurus Mining Ventures was in fact a modern incarnation of Azimuth Biochemicals, Tanner's case was revisited. Following the failed deployment of the Proteus Wave, the detection of numerous Rogue Signal Sources encroaching on human territory that eventually formed the Maelstroms, his initial sentence was overturned and his actions in T Tauri were vindicated. He has since joined the reformed Aegis, continuing his fight against the Thargoids.

## Biography

### Early life and career

Aden Tanner was born in 3254. His father, a medical doctor, expected Aden to pursue the same profession, but he instead joined the Federal Navy on impulse with a group of friends. Although Tanner never regretted his decision, it caused a rift with his father that was left unresolved when his father died in 3277. Tanner's first months in the navy were tarnished by an irreverent and jocular attitude, and he earned the nickname "Spoony" for his habit of eating directly from food packets. Early on, Tanner was disciplined for creating a satirical newsletter that mocked several senior officers, including Sergeant Burke Hazell, who had offered encouragement to Tanner during his basic training and took the newsletter personally. This incident resulted in Tanner being labeled a potential insubordinate. It was only after Commander Myra Dunstock, Tanner's chief instructional officer, took Tanner on a tour of a refugee center that he realized the error of his ways and devoted himself wholeheartedly to his training.^[1]^

### The Autolycus Mutiny

By 3271, Tanner had reached the rank of Chief Gunnery Officer, and was serving aboard the Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser FDN Autolycus under the command of Captain Jaiden Horne when the vessel was deployed to reclaim Coldharbour Station following its occupation by rebels. Although Captain Horne was ordered to only monitor the station while awaiting reinforcements, Horne became convinced that a rebel attack was imminent when communications were lost with the station and began displaying increasingly erratic behavior. When a group of civilian ships attempted to leave the station, Horne assumed they were going to ram the Autolycus and order Tanner to shoot them down. Tanner refused and was thrown in the brig for mutiny, while the civilian ships escaped the system unscathed.^[1]^

Tanner's antics during his training came back to haunt him, as Horne cited them as evidence of rebellious behavior when Tanner was court-martialed for the "Autolycus Mutiny". However, Horne's state of mind became the focus of the trial after it emerged that the escaping ships had been carrying evacuees and communications with Coldharbour Station had been secretly cut by Horne himself; Horne committed suicide, and it was later found that he had been experiencing drug-induced psychosis during the incident on the Autolycus. Tanner was cleared of all charges and received a commendation for his actions from Federal President Antonia Madison.^[1]^

### Aegis

Afterwards, Tanner's naval career flourished. He was eventually promoted to Admiral in the Federal Navy and earned a reputation for level-headedness and staying cool under pressure. He also became a close personal friend of Federal President Zachary Hudson, who appointed him to the newly-created position of Chief of Federal Security, also called the Federation's "alien tsar", on April 7, 3303 in light of the escalating conflict with the recently-returned Thargoids. When the Federation, Empire, and Alliance banded together later that year to create Aegis, a multinational research organization dedicated to understanding the Thargoids and developing the technology to counter them, Tanner was selected as Aegis's Chief Military Liaison and took charge of coordinating the three superpowers' military defenses against the alien threat.

### The T Tauri incident

In 3307, the disappearance of the Aegis Research megaship Alexandria spurred a wide-ranging independent inquiry into Aegis to investigate possible incompetence and misconduct. Aegis was partially suspended for the duration of the inquiry, and Admiral Tanner's civilian counterpart, Professor Alba Tesreau, was forced to resign on August 11, 3307, leaving Tanner the de facto head of the organisation. As Thargoid attacks continued and the mysterious Salvation began experimenting with a new anti-xeno superweapon that seemingly repelled an incursion in the Cornsar system, Tanner began expressing frustration with the restrictions put in place by Dr. Paul Baumann's board of inquiry, and he also became suspicious of Salvation's motives.

On November 5, Tanner commandeered the Aegis Defense megaship Musashi and jumped it to the T Tauri system to conduct an unauthorised search of Hind Mine, the headquarters of Salvation's allies, Taurus Mining Ventures. Tanner claimed to have intel that Hind Mine concealed evidence that Salvation was using his new anti-xeno inventions to deliberately provoke the Thargoids and endanger human colonies. Aegis and Taurus Mining Ventures spokesperson Patience Middleton condemned Tanner's actions as illegal and unwarranted, but Tanner and his renegade Aegis crew disobeyed orders from Aegis leadership to depart T Tauri and launched a military strike against the mining corporation's forces on November 11. Supporters of Salvation flocked to Taurus Mining Ventures' aid, however, and by November 18, Tanner's gamble to expose Salvation's alleged wrongdoings had failed. The Musashi was seized, and Tanner himself was detained and turned over to Aegis for disciplinary action. The Federal Navy announced on November 29 that Tanner had been charged with mutiny and unlawful military action, and would soon be court-martialed.

### Court martial and discharge

On January 5, 3308, as the court martial was underway, Tanner's defence attorney called on the Engineer and Guardian expert Ram Tah as a witness. Ram Tah testified that based on an analysis of the Classified Experimental Equipment used to construct Salvation's superweapon, the components and design of the superweapon were Guardian in origin, and bore similarities to devices found at the Proteus site in Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2. He further explained that Salvation's superweapon likely emitted a star system-wide electromagnetic pulse at a specific frequency to disrupt Thargoid vessels, and the presence of Guardian technology in each superweapon was why Thargoids flocked to systems where the devices were present in overwhelming numbers. The Federal Navy Criminal Court suspended Tanner's trial while it examined this new evidence.^[4]^

This unexpected development failed to rescue Tanner from disgrace, however, as a week later on January 12, he was found guilty and given a dishonourable discharge from the Federal Navy. Tanner's sentencing hearing was postponed at the request of Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori, the newly-promoted head of the Federal Navy, who ordered a full review of Ram Tah's findings.^[5]^

### Post-Proteus Wave Appeal

Following the firing of the Proteus Wave by Salvation and the Battle of HIP 22460, where thousands of Azimuth personnel, including Salvation, as well as supporting Federal, Imperial, and Alliance forces, were killed in the resulting counterpulse and attacks, the Federal Attorney's Office represented Tanner in an appeal for a retrial to reflect and review the case and subsequent ruling over Tanner for his assault on Hind Mind Station.^[6]^

The Federal Navy Criminal Court did review the case, however they did not overturn his conviction of his dishonorable discharge and stripping of his rank and honors from the conviction of mutiny and unlawful military action.  However, they did consider the fact that had his assault on Hind Mind station succeeded, the resulting chain of events leading to the firing of the Proteus Wave and the Battle of HIP 22460 may not have occurred, and commuted his sentence to "time served", allowing him to walk free of Federal custody but preventing any future service within the Federation.^[7]^

## Timeline

12 JAN 3308

- The independent inquiry into Aegis has delivered its final conclusions and recommended that the organisation be closed down. Dr Paul Baumann, who chaired the board of inquiry, summarised the detailed report: "Aegis was established on solid foundations in 3303 with strong leadership. Over the years, poor mid-level management and general negligence reduced its effectiveness. A silo mentality developed, with each department focusing on itself rather than strategic goals. Reduced funding undoubtedly contributed to low morale among staff and a lack of any further breakthroughs in AX technology. But a reliance on independent pilots to combat the Thargoids became normalised, with some staff considering them 'disposable mercenaries'. More specifically, the loss of the megaship Alexandria and the illegal attack against Hind Mine are both catastrophes that could have been anticipated and prevented. This board cannot in all conscience recommend any scenario that might enable further loss of life in Aegis's name." Observers have noted that the Baumann Report, as it is commonly referred to, does not discuss Salvation or suggest methods of replacing Aegis. In related news, the court martial of Admiral Aden Tanner has concluded with a verdict of guilty and a dishonourable discharge from the Federal Navy. However, his sentencing has been postponed by request from newly promoted Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori, who has ordered a full review of evidence provided by Ram Tah.^[5]^

05 JAN 3308

- The military trial of Admiral Aden Tanner has been suspended following evidence provided by Ram Tah as a witness for the defence. The Federal Navy tribunal was called to consider multiple charges – including mutiny – held against Tanner, the chief military liaison to Aegis. While commanding the Musashi megaship, he attempted to gain access to Hind Mine station and locate evidence regarding Salvation's anti-xeno superweapon. Admiral Tanner's defence attorney opened a live link with Phoenix Base to allow Ram Tah to provide the following testimony: "We have analysed the classified experimental equipment that was recently delivered to enable Salvation's superweapons. These components are near-identical to devices found at the Proteus research facility on Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2. In 3113, an Azimuth Biochemicals science team conducted weapons testing using Guardian artefacts from this site, accidentally triggering a radiation surge which resulted in their deaths. My hypothesis is that Salvation has constructed large-scale versions of the Proteus design. These generate a powerful electromagnetic pulse at frequencies which disrupt the Thargoids' bio-mechanical technology. It's highly probable that this is based on an existing Guardian weapon discovered by the Proteus. This would explain why its presence within a system attracts Thargoid vessels." The Federal Navy Criminal Court announced that Admiral Tanner's court martial has been temporarily suspended while the new evidence is reviewed.^[4]^

31 DEC 3307

- The last in a series that reviews the events of the past year, by noted historian Sima Kalhana.
"October brought further controversy for the Federation, when a diplomatic conference in the Delta Pavonis system was revealed to be a honey trap designed to capture Yuri Grom. Only a rush of support for EG Union allowed their ruler to escape, causing political embarrassment for President Hudson. There was more corporate drama when Zemina Torval relinquished her long-held majority sharehold of Mastopolos Mining, fuelling rumours of a family rift with her cousins. Torval Mining Ltd became a fully independent corporation run by her daughter Constantia. The Colonia Bridge project officially started the first of two phases this year which would see the construction of 56 megaships between the Alcor and Colonia systems. Brewer Corporation enjoyed great public support for improving this travel corridor along the 22,000 light year journey, and revealed plans to enhance it further in the new year. Hadrian Duval, his wife Lady Astrid and their unborn child were the specific targets of another starport bombing by the NMLA. It proved unsuccessful, but did result in the Imperial Senate offering them protection in order to secure the Duval bloodline. It also led to a manhunt for Theta Seven, the galaxy's most wanted terrorist. In November, Orion University claimed that the dredger occupied by the Scriveners Clan was legally their property, but the nomadic descendants of its original crew refused to give up their home. The stand-off caught the public attention, with some supporting the clan's right to independence and others keen to discover what their Knowledge Core contained. Ultimately the Scriveners retained their freedom, sailing off into the void with their secrets intact. Many were shocked when Admiral Tanner, Aegis's military chief, went rogue and tried to force access to a starport controlled by Salvation's allies. His conviction that the anti-xeno superweapons were responsible for provoking the Thargoids was, however, not enough to win the day. The NMLA threw everything they had at the Mudhrid system in an attempt to rescue Theta Seven, who was hiding among the Far God cult to avoid capture. But the terrorists were crushed by ACT and a coalition of ships, with Theta Seven martyring himself by destroying the hijacked megaship Sacrosanct. A happier event in December was the birth of Hector Duval, son and heir of Hadrian and Lady Astrid. There were celebrations across the Empire, but also questions asked about the future of the Duval dynasty and if the child might one day inherit the Imperial throne. The year ended as it had begun, with Thargoid vessels swarming into nebula systems. But with incursions steadily increasing over recent months, there were fears that this time they might prove unstoppable. Salvation's superweapons were once again deployed to halt the aliens' progress, but will they be enough to prevent the Thargoids from threatening humanity in 3308?"^[8]^

29 NOV 3307

- Admiral Aden Tanner and the crew of the Musashi megaship will be placed on trial for attacking Salvation's allies. The admiral disobeyed orders by attempting to gain access to Hind Mine starport, the headquarters of Taurus Mining Ventures. After failing to achieve this, most of the Musashi's crewmembers were detained and repatriated to their respective home systems to face civil or military charges. The Federal Navy has published this official notice: "Admiral Tanner is formally accused of mutiny and unlawful military action while in command of the Musashi. He will stand trial in a general court-martial. If found guilty, he will be dishonourably discharged and imprisoned for life." Dr Paul Baumann, chair of the independent board of inquiry into Aegis, commented: "Recent events in the T Tauri system clearly fall within the scope of our investigation. For Aegis's chief military liaison to launch an unauthorised attack, at the cost of many lives, will weigh heavily against the organisation." Admiral Tanner claims that the anti-xeno superweapon deployed by Salvation in the Cornsar system has triggered an increase in Thargoid attacks. Although there is no direct evidence of this, the Thargoids have performed coordinated strikes against several systems in the weeks since that event.^[9]^

18 NOV 3307

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
Taurus Mining Ventures has defeated a rogue Aegis Defense force and gained control of the megaship Musashi. The conflict was initiated by Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison with Aegis. He was attempting to gain access to Hind Mine asteroid base, in search of evidence that Salvation's anti-xeno weapon was deliberately designed to provoke the Thargoids. Patience Middleton, a spokesperson for Taurus Mining Ventures, made this announcement: "This was an illegal and unnecessary conflict, brought about by Admiral Tanner's misguided obsession. We will continue working with Salvation to eliminate the Thargoid threat. Our defence was only possible thanks to our courageous supporters, for whom rewards are available at Hind Mine. We will also honour agreements that the Aegis Defense force made with independent pilots, who can collect their promised payments from the Musashi." Taurus Mining Ventures later confirmed that all members of the Musashi's original crew will be allowed to leave the megaship unharmed. Admiral Tanner and other key personnel are in temporary custody. Aegis has arranged for them to be transferred to its internal security teams.^[10]^

11 NOV 3307

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
A rogue Aegis Defense force has initiated conflict with Taurus Mining Ventures in the T Tauri system. The megaship Musashi is commanded by Aegis's chief military liaison Admiral Aden Tanner, who made this announcement: "The Hind Mine asteroid base contains proof that Salvation's unlicensed anti-xeno weapon is intentionally designed to provoke the Thargoids, and therefore endangers us all. As Taurus Mining Ventures refuses to cooperate, we have no choice but to obtain the evidence by force. This may be our only opportunity to discover Salvation's true ambitions. I urge all independent pilots who have fought alongside Aegis to help us complete this vital mission." Patience Middleton, a spokesperson for Taurus Mining Ventures, responded: "This is an illegal attack that jeopardises the important work we are undertaking on behalf of Salvation. It is in the galactic community's interests to defend our corporate headquarters." Aegis officially stated that Admiral Tanner is acting on his own authority, and that the Musashi's presence in the T Tauri system is in direct violation of orders. Despite this, there are reports that Tanner has tacit support from many members of Aegis, who disagree with the public inquiry that has suspended its operations.^[11]^

05 NOV 3307

- Admiral Aden Tanner has called for Aegis to reject the public inquiry's shutdown and take direct action against Salvation. The Musashi, an Aegis Defense megaship under his command, has entered the T Tauri system to challenge Taurus Mining Ventures. The corporation has performed activities on Salvation's behalf, including preparation for the anti-xeno weapon used to eliminate all Thargoids from the Cornsar system. Admiral Tanner transmitted this message to media outlets: "Salvation's unlicensed weapons technology is deliberately designed to provoke the Thargoids, risking millions of lives. My sources tell me that Hind Mine asteroid base contains evidence of this. I therefore demand that Taurus Mining Ventures allows us access so we can determine the truth." Patience Middleton of Taurus Mining Ventures responded: "We are a legitimate business under contract to a private citizen, whose activities are protected by confidentiality agreements. These threats have no legal standing and are not welcome." Admiral Tanner is a highly decorated Federal Navy officer and Aegis's chief military liaison, having coordinated many combat efforts against the Thargoids. The Musashi's relocation has been condemned by Aegis leadership, and Tanner has been ordered to depart the T Tauri system.^[12]^

28 OCT 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
 Several inhabited systems in the Pleiades and Witch Head Nebulas have come under attack by large numbers of Thargoid ships. An emergency has been declared by the authorities in multiple systems including Asterope, Shenve and Onoros. Thargoid vessels have again targeted starports, with casualties estimated in the many thousands. Increased Thargoid activity has also been reported in the California and Coalsack Nebulas. Independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons are moving to defend the invaded systems and evacuate survivors from damaged starports. Aegis is not currently able to assist, as the operational shutdown enforced by the public inquiry has led to many ships and pilots being withdrawn from service. Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison to Aegis, commented: "Many of us in Aegis are frustrated that the Baumann Report has tied our hands. I am also convinced that these Thargoids are reacting aggressively to the weapon of mass destruction that Salvation deployed in the Cornsar system. Not only should we be fighting the alien threat, but Salvation must be prevented from escalating the war." The Taurus Mining Ventures megaship Bright Sentinel has moved to the Merope system at Salvation's request. Reports indicate that tech brokers on board are offering a Guardian-hybrid plasma charger as well as material cost discounts to support the anti-xeno effort.^[13]^

11 AUG 3307

- An investigation into the tri-superpower organisation Aegis is seeking to establish the reasons for its failures. Dr Paul Baumann, chair of the independent board of inquiry, outlined its scope: "The initial phase is to fully understand the work of Aegis, before examining strategic and operational decisions. Interviews with senior staff have been scheduled, with Admiral Aden Tanner providing details on military activity. One specific area of attention is the lost megaship Alexandria. We are performing a thorough analysis, including background checks on its crew. Hyperspace physicists are theorising probable causes for its failure to arrive at HIP 30944. We will be raising issues of culpability, specifically whether the concentration of Guardian artefacts aboard the Alexandria directly led to systems coming under Thargoid attack. Other incidents will be reviewed to identify possible grounds for negligence." Many prominent figures within Aegis have resigned including Professor Alba Tesreau, Director Yazhu Xing and Dr Mia Valencourt. All active projects have been suspended, with routine activities continuing under independent observation. Some politicians in all three superpowers have protested against the inquiry, concerned about weakening defences against the Thargoids. Others believe Aegis is not fit for purpose, calling for a more localised approach to anti-xeno operations.^[14]^

04 JUN 3307

- The Alexandria has failed to arrive in the HIP 30944 system as scheduled, and may have been hyperdicted by the Thargoids. The Aegis-owned megaship triggered an attack by Thargoid vessels when it travelled from the Delphi system to HIP 16538 on the 20th of May. Aegis believes this was caused by the large quantity of Guardian artefacts in its cargo holds. To reduce the risk of further casualties, the Alexandria plotted a route to a low-population prison colony in the HIP 30944 system. All independent ships were undocked before it made the hyperspace jump on the 3rd of June. However, the megaship never reached its arrival point and all communication with it has ceased. Search teams in local systems have not detected its presence. Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison with Aegis, informed the media: "We regret to announce a complete loss of contact with the Alexandria. Although there is no evidence of damage or destruction, its disappearance while travelling through hyperspace raises the possibility that it was intercepted en route by Thargoid forces. Captain Jacob Morales and over four thousand crewmembers will be listed as missing presumed dead. In addition to this great tragedy, Aegis's research programme into Guardian technology has been severely impacted by the loss of many precious artefacts."^[15]^

24 MAY 3307

- The Alexandria megaship has been warned that it faces destruction if it attempts to travel to any Federal system. The Aegis-owned vessel triggered a full-scale Thargoid incursion when it arrived in the HIP 16538 system. This seemed to be a reaction to the huge quantities of Guardian artefacts currently stored within its cargo holds. Captain Jacob Morales, the Alexandria's commander, broadcast this message: "The Federal Navy has instructed us not to resume our scheduled journey to Sol or enter any system within the Federation. They're treating us like a plague ship! I understand their concern that more Thargoids will follow us, but we have several thousand crewmembers who need to reach safe harbour." A strategy was outlined by Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis: "We are attempting to clear the HIP 16538 system of Thargoid vessels, greatly aided by independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons. The megaship will then jump to a system with a minimal population, where we will offload its cargo." Aegis has reiterated that the option to jettison the Alexandria's cargo is a last resort, since the Guardian artefacts are vital to its research programme and cost billions of credits to acquire.^[16]^

21 MAY 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
The Alexandria megaship has jumped from Delphi to the HIP 16538 system, triggering a Thargoid attack. The megaship is carrying large quantities of Guardian artefacts, which were delivered as part of a research programme by Aegis. Captain Jacob Morales, commanding officer of the Alexandria, has broadcast an SOS: "This is an emergency! We scheduled a stopover in HIP 16538 for tritium refuelling en route to the Sol system, but Thargoid interceptors came swarming in within minutes. We require immediate assistance!" Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis, announced: "We believe that the Thargoids are reacting to the concentrated presence of Guardian technology stored within the Alexandria's cargo holds. Not only has the attack placed its crew and the population of this system in danger, but we risk losing these extremely valuable research materials. Aegis is asking anti-xeno squadrons and independent pilots to help destroy all Thargoid vessels within HIP 16538 and protect the Alexandria."^[17]^

07 JAN 3307

- Starports in the Coalsack and Witch Head Nebulas have been damaged during full-scale Thargoid incursions. An appeal by Aegis for anti-xeno support led to a concerted response from the galactic community. However, the Thargoid forces proved to be overwhelming and have attacked systems within the nebulas, with the loss of thousands of lives. Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison of Aegis, broadcast this message: "Despite the heroic efforts of many pilots, the alien ships have resisted being driven from the Witch Head Nebula. Aegis's military capability and manpower are both severely limited as a result of curtailed funding from the Empire and the Federation. We have no choice but to rely on independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons as the first line of defence against the Thargoid threat."^[18]^

31 DEC 3306

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Large numbers of Thargoid vessels are swarming through multiple inhabited systems, leading to urgent calls for assistance. In what appears to be a coordinated strike, Thargoid scouts and interceptors have appeared throughout the Coalsack and Witch Head Nebulas. Local security ships have engaged them in combat, but report being overwhelmed. The Alliance has a considerable presence in these regions, with four starports recently constructed in the Coalsack Nebula. But the Alliance Defence Force has not been able to mobilise in time to prevent some systems from becoming infested with Thargoids. Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis, made this announcement: "This is a resurgence of Thargoid activity on a scale that we have not witnessed for a long time. Unfortunately, drastic reductions in funding and resources mean that Aegis is unable to provide adequate defensive measures. We urgently request support from independent pilots and anti-xeno squadrons. It is critical that we prevent the Thargoids from dominating these nebulas and wiping out many thousands of people."^[19]^

31 JUL 3305

- Recent reports from the Witch Head Nebula indicate that the Thargoid forces in the region have been defeated. The initial call to arms from Aegis Research was met with an overwhelming response from independent pilots, who were able to push back Thargoid incursions from the new human colonies. Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis, said: "Humanity has achieved a decisive victory in the Witch Head Nebula. Significant numbers of Thargoid vessels were destroyed in the conflict, even as many independent pilots were lost. But the sacrifice of these brave souls was not in vain, for the enemy has been forced to withdraw. While the threat of occasional incursions from Thargoid craft remains, our colonial assets have been firmly established in the region." Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis Research looked to the future: "The Alliance, Empire and Federation have declared that the Witch Head Nebula is now an official enclave of humanity – a region that their joint efforts have enabled them to share equally. But the damage inflicted on our new starports must be repaired before we can harvest the barnacle sites in the area. Independent pilots have already given so much, and for that I am humbled and thankful. And yet, we must ask for one last favour: to support the repair of these starports."^[20]^

22 JUL 3305

- Carson's Spring, the megaship transporting Professor Ishmael Palin from the Maia system, has successfully completed its journey, having endured a number of attacks by Thargoid craft. Admiral Aden Tanner provided this update on behalf of Aegis Research: "With support from many independent combat pilots, the Thargoid assaults on Carson's Spring have been successfully repelled. The megaship has now arrived in the Arque system with Professor Palin and his staff." Palin currently remains aboard Carson's Spring. Efforts are underway to establish a new permanent home at Abel Laboratory on Arque 4 E, from where Palin's previously offered engineering services can resume.^[21]^

11 JUL 3305

- Reports indicate that the Thargoids have abruptly withdrawn from the majority of human-occupied space. Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison for Aegis, announced: "Multiple reliable sources have reported a mass departure of Thargoid craft. Their forces vanished from dozens of locations within hours of each other. Only the Maia and Merope systems are still reporting Thargoid activity. Our theory is that the Thargoids have retreated due to our defence operations depleting their numbers. Then again, they may simply be reconsidering their strategy. Either way, Aegis will continue to monitor the situation." In response, Professor Ishmael Palin of the Palin Research Centre offered words of warning: "Celebrating any kind of victory over the Thargoids would be premature. We have no proof that their withdrawal was a result of human activity, and this action is at odds with their highly territorial nature. Nevertheless, this is still a significant – if mysterious – development."^[22]^

18 APR 3305

- It has now been more than two months since the Thargoids began a concentrated assault on the core systems, and in that time they have attacked dozens of starports, resulting in thousands of casualties. s authorities in the affected systems continue to appeal for aid, Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis's chief military liaison, has offered the following assessment: "What's surprising is that the Thargoids aren't targeting our most important social or military centres, such as the superpowers' home systems. There's no doubt that they're trying to weaken us, but evidently they're guided by different principles than those that typically govern human martial strategy. What we can say is this: with capital ships of limited use against Thargoid craft, independent combat pilots remain our best defence against the Thargoids."^[23]^

29 AUG 3304

- The Pilots Federation confirmed independent pilots' recent reports of a new Thargoid Interceptor variant, the Hydra. Admiral Aden Tanner also provided Aegis's preliminary findings: "We can confirm that this new ship – classified as the Hydra – is a variant of the Thargoid Interceptor. It is structurally stronger than the Cyclops, Basilisk or Medusa, and releases a larger swarm of Thargon drones."^[24]^

16 AUG 3304

- Admiral Aden Tanner confirmed reports that Aegis's Eagle Eye installations had gone offline. The disruption had been caused by Thargoid Sensor-related interference at Dantec Enterprise in Socho, the headquarters of Aegis Core and a vital component of the Eagle Eye array. Admiral Tanner explained, "With Dantec Enterprise experiencing widespread technical issues, it's impossible for us to communicate with the Eagle Eye installations. And unless the installations are fed a continuous stream of data, they are essentially useless. The Eagle Eye installations are one of the most effective weapons we have in our war against the Thargoids, and we would be grateful to any pilots who could deliver meta-alloys to Dantec Enterprise, to help us get the starport back online."^[25]^

28 JUN 3304

- Aegis reported that Eagle Eye had detected a massive surge in Thargoid transmissions. Admiral Tanner elaborated on the situation: "Following the Thargoids' retreat, all evidence suggested that their surface sites had become dormant. But new data from our Eagle Eye network shows that they have surged back to life, and that the star maps inside these structures are now pinpointing the Deciat system. It seems this was only a brief respite while they summoned reinforcements from the Pleiades. Latest intelligence indicates that Thargoid vessels are now congregating in large numbers in Deciat space. This is an alarming development for the Garay Terminal starport, which is on high alert. There are also several megaships active in the region, which are potential targets for the Thargoids. On behalf of Aegis, I am calling on all members of the galactic community for assistance in defending Deciat. Without the aid of independent pilots, all assets in the system could be overwhelmed, with the loss of thousands of lives."^[26]^

21 JUN 3304

- Admiral Tanner declared that that the Thargoids had been successfully repelled from the Core Systems: "This is a very positive development. Using data from our Eagle Eye network, courageous members of the galactic community have formed a barrier of steel and fire, preventing Thargoid vessels from encroaching further. In doing so they have prevented several starports from being attacked, saving many thousands of lives. Furthermore, in many regions the Thargoid incursion has actually been reversed. Although they remain entrenched within the Pleiades, their forces in the core systems have been pushed back to the Bhal system, their initial beachhead. Aegis offers its sincere thanks and congratulations to every one of the Commanders who risked their lives by meeting our enemy in battle. These audacious pilots have proved that humanity’s spirit is far from broken. Victory against the Thargoids will be hard-won, but I am in no doubt that with defenders of this calibre, it will one day be achieved."^[27]^

31 MAY 3304

- Admiral Tanner touted the success of Aegis's Eagle Eye initiative in helping predict and prevent Thargoid attacks: "I have no doubt that without this surveillance data, more starports in the Pleiades would have been attacked and damaged. Only last week, Thargoid incursions in the Lwalama and Lalande 4141 systems were vigorously resisted thanks to the early warnings provided by Eagle Eye. We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to those brave Commanders who have engaged the Thargoids in battle. Aegis was established to help protect the galaxy, and with the help of courageous members of the galactic community we will assuredly triumph."^[28]^

09 MAY 3304

- Admiral Tanner addressed concerns about the Thargoids' advance into the Core Systems: "Reports that the Thargoids are encroaching upon the core systems en masse are grossly overstated. Although they have crossed the threshold, all we have seen so far are localised incidents in fringe systems. This is not a full-scale invasion, and it does not warrant large fleet movements of the kind that have been suggested. Rest assured: the enemy is contained. There is no need for panic. Courageous independent pilots, armed with Aegis technology, are doing a superb job at halting the Thargoids' progress. It’s to be expected that we suffer occasional losses in this conflict, but these do not indicate an impending catastrophe."^[29]^

03 MAY 3304

- Admiral Tanner issued a statement on behalf of Aegis in response to Simguru Pranav Antal's suggestion that humanity could lose the war against the Thargoids: "Let me make this clear: our enemy may be powerful, but they are far from achieving victory. With our AX weaponry and new megaships, Aegis is leading an effective resistance against Thargoid forces."^[30]^

30 MAR 3304

- Admiral Tanner formally announced the deployment of Aegis's military flagships, Acropolis and Vanguard: "It is vital that Aegis has a military presence in the theatre of conflict. These new ships will coordinate anti-Thargoid operations wherever they are deployed, and will support independent pilots. In response to recent Thargoid incursions, the Acropolis has been dispatched to the Lunguni system, while the Vanguard is operating in the Mentor system. However, their key advantage over a starport or base is their mobility, so both will periodically relocate to wherever they can be strategically effective. Constructing these two gigantic vessels was a considerable undertaking for Aegis, but we are convinced the expense and effort is worthwhile. Our remit requires us to occupy a guiding role in the resistance against the Thargoids, and these megaships will bring that into focus."^[31]^

29 MAR 3304

- Admiral Tanner released a statement concerning Aegis's ongoing surveillance of Thargoid Surface Sites: "Undoubtedly, the most positive outcome of our Eagle Eye initiative is that it has allowed us to determine which locations the Thargoids intend to attack. This has proved invaluable in our ongoing fight against the Thargoids. It appears, however, that the sites are currently dormant, as no energy-level fluctuations have been detected for several days. Hopefully this means we can look forward to a temporary reprieve from Thargoid attacks. Our military flagships, the Vanguard and the Acropolis, will remain on standby in HIP 21559 and Irandan until needed."^[32]^

16 MAR 3304

- Aegis released the following statement on behalf of Admiral Tanner: "The new Eagle Eye installations are a success, they have identified fluctuations in Thargoid transmissions from a number of planet side structures. With the invaluable help of the members of the Pilots Federation we have identified that the new signals are pointing to locations in human space. We believe these to be identifying the location of potential Thargoid attacks and if this is proved to be the case it will be a huge break through and a validation of our work here. We continue to monitor the Thargoid activity using the Eagle Eye installations in the Pleiades and have confirmed reports that the Eagle Eye installations have detected new signals. We urge all available pilots to investigate these changes to see if we can thwart the Thargoids."^[33]^

09 MAR 3304

- Admiral Tanner commented on Aegis's launch of the Eagle Eye surveillance initiative: "Our new Eagle Eye initiative will closely monitor systems where Thargoid surface sites are known to exist. We have established orbital surveillance installations at six locations in the Pleiades, which will measure energy-level fluctuations and track ship movements. Each installation is attended by a comms beacon that will collect the data before transmitting it to us for analysis."^[34]^

24 FEB 3304

- After Aegis confirmed that the Thargoids had been directly targeting Aegis laboratories, Admiral Aden Tanner made this statement: "We have identified that the Thargoids are specifically targeting starports where Aegis laboratories are established. These include Titan's Daughter in the Taygeta system, Liman Legacy in HIP 16753 and the Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55."^[35]^

27 OCT 3303

- Admiral Tanner addressed reports of capital ships being destroyed by the Thargoids: "Although the shutdown field neutraliser developed by Aegis is capable of protecting small ships, we have encountered difficulties adapting the technology to larger spacecraft. Furthermore, the fact that Thargoids tend to target larger vessels with multiple shutdown beams simultaneously makes the task of protecting them more difficult.The fact that capital-class ships are more vulnerable to Thargoid attack means they are an ineffective way of protecting outposts, planets and shipping lanes. Consequently, for the present, the deployment of capital ships is not considered an effective defence strategy."^[36]^

19 AUG 3303

- After reports surfaced that Admiral Tanner was liaising with Aegis, Tanner made the following statement: "It is my sincere pleasure to support Aegis in its mission and contribute to what I hope will be a new era of collaboration. I know there are those who have questioned my involvement with Aegis, but I can assure you that after forty years in the military, I am ready for some peace."^[3]^

07 APR 3303

- Following his appointment to the newly-created role of Chief of Federal Security, Admiral Aden Tanner made the following statement: "Having reviewed all available information, we can confirm these craft are active primarily within the Pleiades Nebula and the space in and around the Maia and Merope systems. The significance of these locations – if any – has not yet been determined. We can also confirm, despite rumours to the contrary, that carrying an Unknown Artefact does not attract the attention of these vessels. A number of independent pilots claim to have seen evidence that these ships have attacked human vessels, but no empirical verification has been recovered. Nevertheless, I would urge the galactic community to treat these strange ships with extreme caution."^[2]^
