Thargoid Spire structures
 		 	 
**Thargoid Spire** sites are huge organic structures of Thargoid origin, grown on planet surfaces. They are approximately 6 km tall (3x the length of a Majestic-Class Interdictor). Active Spire sites were protected by Banshees and interceptors such as the Orthrus and Cyclops.

## Overview

Following the invasions of human occupied systems, a number of Thargoid Barnacle Matrix sites were discovered on worlds with thin ammonia atmospheres, leading to fears of Thargoid Colonisation effors. these Matrix sites eventually evolved into Spires, with the first site spotted on 16 October 3309.

While the exact function of the Spire sites is difficult to determine, they appeared to act as vast refineries and depots supporting the Titan in control of the system. In the later stages of the war, a process of contaminating these refineries proved critical to undermining the defenses of the eight Titan systems.

## Features

As of 3310 there were 45 known Thargoid Spire sites in the human bubble, all on planets with tenuous atmospheres. These sites can be explored solo or in a group.^[1]^ In addition to the Spires themselves, several smaller elements can be found on the surface, including barnacle-like industrial hubs and large coral clusters covered in bio-material that can be scanned with an Artemis suit.

The enormous Spires have petals large enough to easily be landed on; at the base of these petals are arrays that can be activated by overloading various nerve clusters, providing Thargoid materials. During the war, Rescue Vessels had missions to hand in these materials, providing a modified compound that could be returned to the site to contaminate it.  

Banshees and Revenants patrolled the ground level regions of the Spire sites, making on-foot reconnaissance difficult. The Scorpion SRV is useful in teams vs the Banshee with 1 driver and 1 turret gunner. Banshees also made aerial combat difficult as their shut-down missiles could overwhelm AX craft with sheer numbers, even those equipped with Shutdown Field Neutralisers.  Interceptors such as the Orthrus and Cyclops may be seen entering and emerging from 4 portals of the largest spire, with the Orthruses summoning Scouts to the area if attacked. This concentration of interceptors (particularly the unarmed and valuable Orthrus) made spire sites a popular location for AX operations by multiple wings of commanders.

Following the contamination of these sites and the destruction of the Titan's controlling their host systems, all known Thargoid Sites have entered a shutdown state. While the sites can still be visited and explored, the production facilities are dormant and no hostile craft can be found in the area.
