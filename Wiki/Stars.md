Stars
 		 	 

The Milky Way contains 400 billion **stars**. These spheres of plasma are sustained by nuclear fusion and bound together by the enormity of their mass. The energy from the fusion of hydrogen into helium and helium into other, heavier elements produces heat and light, or electromagnetic radiation. Stars form the center of star systems, in which stars are orbited by planets and other astronomical objects, including other stars. A subset of stars known as Main Sequence stars produce hydrogen-rich coronae that ships can skim for fuel using a Fuel Scoop.

## Stellar Classification

For example, the Sun of Sol has the classification identifier: ***G2 V***

Each identifier consists of three components:

1. Spectral class: A capital letter out of the sequence: ***O, B, A, F, G, K, M***. (A helpful real-world mnemonic for remembering this is, "Oh Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me.") This mainly specifies the temperature ranging from ***O*** (hottest) to ***M*** (coolest). Other letters specify extensions to this classification system, namely: ***W (WN, WC, WO), L, T, Y, C, S***, ***D.*** A few of those classes have subclasses such as ***DA***, ***DB*** and ***DC*** as subclasses of ***D.***
2. Spectral subclass: Each letter class is then subdivided using a numeric digit with ***0*** being the hottest and ***9*** being the coolest.
3. Luminosity class: A luminosity class is added to the spectral class using Roman numerals.This classifies the stars by its spectral characteristics considering color and brightness. Those spectral characteristics provide information about the type of the star:

- ***I*** for *supergiants*
    - ***Ia*** or ***0*** for extremely luminous *supergiants*
    - ***Iab*** for normal *supergiants*
    - ***Ib*** for less luminous *supergiants*
- ***II*** for bright *giants*
- ***III*** for regular *giants*
- ***IV*** for *sub-giants*
- ***V*** for *main-sequence stars (*most of the known stars belong to this class)
    - ***Va*** for extremely luminous *main sequence stars*
    - ***Vab*** for luminous *main sequence stars*
    - ***Vb*** for normal *main sequence stars*
    - ***Vz*** for less luminous *main sequence stars*
- ***VI*** for *sub-dwarfs*
- ***VII*** for *white dwarf*

Thus, G2 V means: The Sun is semi hot (G), it belongs to the hotter stars (2) in class G and it is considered as a so called main-sequence star (***V***).

| Black Hole | Black holes are typically the stellar remnants of super massive stars of twenty solar masses or more, that have reached the end of their lives. Nuclear fusion has ceased, and the star collapsed to the most extreme point possible - where gravity is so extreme light itself can no longer escape. If matter should fall on to such a body, an extreme burst of gamma radiation will be emitted, but otherwise the body is only visible by the gravitational distortion in the vicinity. In many cases black holes can be seen emitting brightly in X-rays because of matter falling on to their surface from a companion body.

| Neutron Star | Neutron stars are the stellar remnants of massive stars that have reached the end of their lives. Once nuclear fusion was exhausted, the star collapsed into a tiny volume.<br>Because of its high mass, the matter has collapsed into Neutron-degenerate matter (sometimes called Neutronium), an extremely high density state made up entirely of neutrons (matter composed of stuff other than atoms, such as quarks, protons, neutrons or whatever, is referred to as "degenerate matter"). Unlike most degenerate matter where electrons are below the Fermi-Energy (chemical potential at T=0), the compression is so great that the Fermi-Energy of the electrons increases such that they combine with protons to form neutrons. As the star is in equilibrium, its gravity is balanced by 'neutron degeneracy pressure' (compressed neutron wave functions which are energetic due to the uncertainty principle), though with more mass the system's gravity would overcome the neutron degeneracy pressure forming a black hole. Degenerate matter stars are as dense as matter can possibly be without becoming a black hole.
<br>Take caution when approaching these stars, as they are so tiny they are almost invisible. They still radiate heat, and getting closer than 0.25Ls will cause one's heat to build up. If you fly with your ship into the emitted energy cloud your FSD will be supercharged and the jump range for the next jump will be dramatically increased. However, dropping out of supercruise while within a neutron star's jet is incredibly dangerous, as incredibly fast particles of ionized matter will tear through your ship's hull and systems. Take special care when supercharging to ensure that you do not fly too close to the star, or your ship may be heavily damaged/destroyed after performing an emergency drop.

### White Dwarfs (D, DA\*, DB\*, DC\*, DO\*, DQ, DX)

With a ratio of ~0.36%^[1]^ of all stars this category can be considered **Very Rare**.^[2]^

White dwarfs (category D for degenerate) are the collapsed core of a star that has lost a large proportion (~20%) of its original mass as the ejected material of a planetary nebula or in a supernova explosion, the terminal stages of stellar evolution. White dwarfs are not stars because they no longer sustain nuclear fusion, and lacking this interior thermal source of support the star has gravitationally collapsed to a very small radius. White dwarfs glow with the residual heat of the degenerate core, which can have a temperature well above 100,000 K at collapse and that cools over several billion years. Class D is further divided into spectral types^[7]^ that indicate the elemental composition of the photosphere.

- DA: strong Balmer series hydrogen absorption lines only; no helium or metals present.
- DB: strong He I (neutral helium) absorption lines only; no hydrogen or metals present.
- DC: a continuous (blackbody) spectrum with no absorption lines deeper than 5% in any part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
- DO: strong lines of He II (ionized helium) with molecular hydrogen or helium present.
- DQ: carbon absorption lines, either atomic or molecular, in any part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
- DZ: metal (elements heavier than helium) absorption lines in the absence of both hydrogen and helium lines.

Symbols Appended to the Above Designations

- P: magnetic white dwarfs with detectable polarization.
- H: magnetic white dwarfs without polarization.
- X: peculiar or unclassifiable spectrum.
- E: emission lines (of any element) present.
- ?, :: uncertain classification.
- V: variable luminosity.
- d: circumstellar dust.
- C I, C II, O I, O II added within parentheses to indicate the presence of these elements in DQ objects.

The current practice is to append numerical indicators of the white dwarf temperature and surface gravity, separated by an underline "\_". Temperature is indicated as the effective surface temperature divided into 50400 and rounded to the first decimal place, e.g. DA.9 = 56000 K and DB1.2 = 42000 K. Gravity is assessed as the width of the dominant spectral lines and the log values range from 7 to 9.

The table below shows the white dwarf subtypes within *Elite Dangerous*. These do not necessarily match the notation mentioned above (for example, ED uses DAZ which probably should be DZ) but comes very close. The "Rarity" column indicates the subtype rarity within the White Dwarfs spectrum.

Some star systems consist of two or more stars that orbit one or more common barycentres. These are typically referred to as binary star systems in the case of two stars, or multiple star systems in the case of more than two stars. For each star, the others in its system are known as companion stars. The first person who discovered binary stars was German-British astronomer William Herschel. He published the first catalogue of binary stars with measurements of their relative positions to the Royal Society in London in 1782 CE (269 double or multiple systems).^[8]^ A second catalogue was published in 1784 (434 systems) and a third catalogue in 1821 (145 systems).^[9]^ William noted that Newton's laws of gravity also apply outside of the Sol system. His son John Herschel found thousands more binary stars and updated the catalogue.^[10]^

Binary and multiple star systems are somewhat uncommon in the Milky Way galaxy, but they can present a travel hazard to unprepared pilots as they drop into a new system from hyperspace, as the distance between these stars can sometimes be only a few light seconds. A ship flying between an especially close pair of stars can easily overheat, which can be disastrous for explorers who happen to be thousands of light years away from a station.

Systems with binary or multiple neutron stars are especially rare. The system Dryuae Scraa BA-A g18, near Colonia, is the only known example of a system with two pairs of binary neutron stars.^[11]^

## Ringed Stars

On rare occasions, stellar objects can host ring systems. This is much more common for Class T and Y brown dwarfs orbiting class B or O stars. Occasionally, Class L brown dwarfs will also host ring systems under similar circumstances. It is very rare for main-sequence stars to host ring systems, and this generally only occurs for Class M red dwarfs. White dwarfs and neutron stars may also have rings, with a similar level of rarity as M classes having rings.

## Largest Stars

Some of the largest and most well-known **stars** in the galaxy are listed below, from smallest to largest. They are ordered by solar radius which is the unit of measurement based on the radius of the sun in Sol (695,700 km; 432,288 mi). The largest known star within 10k ly from Sol is Eta Carinae, located 7500 ly from Sol.

UY Scuti, NML Cygni and RSGC1-F01 are not included in Elite Dangerous, because back in 2013 when ED's galaxy was being crafted, their diameter had not yet been measured and reported in the popular astronomy press. At that time, VY Canis Majoris was the largest star in the known galaxy. The red supergiant RSGC1-F01 in RSGC 1 (*Red Supergiant Cluster 1*) is estimated to be the largest star with a radius of 1,530 R.^[12]^ The theoretical limit of a star in the Milky Way is 1,500-1,800 R.^[12]^
