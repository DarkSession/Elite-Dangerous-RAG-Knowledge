A **Universal Language** is a hypothetical or historical language spoken and understood by all or most of the population on a planet or star system. It can refer to a means of communication that's understood by all living things, beings, and objects alike. It's also an international auxiliary language for communication between groups who speak different primary languages.^[1]^

In the 34th century, the Federation diction^[2]^ is the most prevalent and thus considered the universal language in the galaxy. People in the Empire speak with a quirky accent derived from the Federation diction.^[2]^ This allows easy communication between people of different star systems. Besides speaking the Universal Language, some people or species may use other regional languages on a daily basis.

## History

From 1583 CE to 1913 CE the former British Empire established the use of English in regions around the world such as North America, India, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.^[3]^

Due to globalization many smaller languages and dialects fell out of use as its speakers died out or shifted to speaking another language. Thus many became extinct languages.^[5]^

At the end of World War III in 2055, the United States of the Americas dominated Earth. The last remaining countries later joined the newly formed Federation.^[6]^^[7]^ While the corporations rebuilt human civilization, the Federation diction became the primary language of Earth. Over centuries, it spread across countless star systems as humans colonized the galaxy.

In 3304 CE, the Federation is the oldest and largest of the three major factions.^[8]^ Thus the Federation diction is most commonly used. People in the Empire speak with a quirky accent derived from the Federation diction.^[2]^
