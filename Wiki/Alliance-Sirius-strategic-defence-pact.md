# Alliance-Sirius strategic defence pact
The **Alliance-Sirius strategic defence pact** is a military cooperation agreement between the Alliance and Sirius Corporation that was signed in Alioth on January 3, 3308, during the Second Thargoid War.^[1]^ Proposed by Prime Minister Edmund Mahon on December 22, 3307 as a way to bolster the Alliance Defence Force's ability to counter Thargoid attacks in the absence of Aegis,^[2]^ the pact allows the Sirius Navy to coordinate with the ADF in anti-xeno operations. In exchange, Sirius Corporation was granted certain financial opportunities within Alliance territory. Under Alliance law, the pact is a military matter and its exact terms are classified.^[1]^

Since coming into effect on January 10, 3308, the strategic defence pact created a seat on the Alliance's Council of Admirals for a Sirius Navy representative,^[3]^ and Sirius Corporation was invited to establish a presence in the Allied systems of Alioth, Arimpox, Di Jian, and Leesti.^[4]^^[5]^ Originally, Reorte was selected to host one of Sirius Corp's megaships, the Chariot of Rhea, but it was replaced by Leesti after Reorte's ruling faction protested against associating with Sirius Corp and forcibly expelled it on February 3, 3308.^[4]^^[6]^^[7]^^[5]^ The Alliance and Sirius Corp are also in the process of forming a specialised anti-xeno taskforce that will assume the role left vacant by Aegis's dissolution.^[8]^^[9]^

The pact proved to be controversial within the Alliance. While it was approved by the Alliance Assembly by a plurality, the secrecy surrounding the pact's terms, skepticism of Sirius's intentions, and concerns about the integration of military and commercial interests have fueled criticism from prominent figures such as Councillor Nakato Kaine and Admiral George Varma.^[1]^^[3]^ The Reorte debacle also caused some councillors to rethink their support for the agreement,^[10]^ resulting in the Assembly censuring Mahon on February 25 for "disregarding the Alliance's principles by unilaterally forcing cooperation with Sirius Corporation".^[11]^ On March 9, 3308, the Assembly accepted Sirius Corp CEO Li Yong-Rui's offer to set a trial period of three months for the pact; the trial would allow Sirius to demonstrate how it could enhance the ADF's anti-xeno capabilities, and when it ended, the Assembly could choose whether or not to continue the partnership.^[12]^
