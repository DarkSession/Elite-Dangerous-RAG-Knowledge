**Thargoid Pods** are organic, cyst-like growths found at Thargoid Surface Sites. They appear both outside and within the structure, with a particularly large concentration of the objects in the structure's central chamber. SRV weapons can easily destroy them. The function of Thargoid Pods is unknown, but their presence is a sign of Thargoid interference with a planet's ecology. It is speculated that they may be related to Thargoid reproduction.
