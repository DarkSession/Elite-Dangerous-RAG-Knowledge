The Blue Epaulettes ATR unit
 		 	 

**Advanced Tactical Response**, or **ATR**, is a type of elite security unit that is deployed to take down criminals with a high notoriety level. ATR units are active in all inhabited systems except those under the control of an Anarchy minor faction. When criminals commit multiple crimes in succession, especially murders, they will eventually draw the attention of the local ATR unit. Their main purpose is to prevent commanders from operating above the law and to stop criminal activities. They provide support to standard system Security Forces when the latter are overwhelmed.^[1]^^[2]^

ATR units employ Elite-ranked combat pilots who fly heavily-armed and engineered ships to confront the most powerful criminal pilots. They are not invincible, but destroying even a single ATR ship requires a tremendous effort.^[2]^ Upon arrival at an incident site, ATR ships deploy Stonewall Jammers to block further crime reports and prevent additional standard security forces from endangering themselves, and then proceed to chase criminals away from the area or neutralize them. Criminals defeated by ATR are incarcerated at the nearest Detention Centre.
