> Marsha Hicks has been in and out of more penitentiaries than she can count. She decided to go straight and move out to Colonia after the death of her daughter, when the Thargoids attacked Bhal. She doesn't like dealing with people, but everyone has to make a living and working as an engineer is better than going back to jail.
