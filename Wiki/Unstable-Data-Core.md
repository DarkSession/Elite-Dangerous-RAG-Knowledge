**Unstable Data Cores** are a Salvage Commodity.

They are currently one of the rarest commodities in Elite, as the one location were they used to be found has changed, and they can no longer be found there, nor any  other known place in the Galaxy. Only Carrier CMDRs who managed to stock up on them prior to August 26, 3307 are the only known means at which to acquire them.
