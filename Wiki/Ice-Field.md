Ice Field
 		 	 

**Ice Field** is a CQC Championship arena. It is set in an especially dense ice asteroid field. Skilled piloting is required to navigate the asteroid field safely while engaging in combat with other competitors.^[1]^ 

## Notes

- Ice Field is located in the Boepp SU-E d12-818 system in the rings of planet A 3, but cannot be directly accessed outside of a normal CQC match because there is no navigation marker for it.
