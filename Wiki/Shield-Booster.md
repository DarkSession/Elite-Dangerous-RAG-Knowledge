## Usage

The Shield Booster increases shield strength by a given percentage of the base shield automatically and continuously once installed. It will continue functioning as long as it is powered and unbroken. Note that the Shield Booster is not a substitute for a Shield Generator, and will provide no benefit if it is installed on a ship that does not already have an active Shield Generator. If multiple Shield Boosters are installed, the boost effect stacks additively.

## Notes

- The Shield Booster was added in the Wings Update (1.2) on March 10, 2015.
- The *Elite Dangerous: Horizons* 2.3 update was planned to include diminishing returns for stacking Shield Boosters, but these changes were rolled back shortly before release and never implemented.^[1]^ As seen in the 2.3 beta, the changes would have reduced the effectiveness of Shield Booster stacking after a cumulative 80% boost, with a hard cap at 150%.^[2]^
