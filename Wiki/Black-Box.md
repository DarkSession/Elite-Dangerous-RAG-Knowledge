A **Black Box** is a Salvage Commodity that can be found near Shipwrecks and in some Unidentified Signal Sources. It can be turned in at a Search and Rescue Agent for a reward. It is considered illegal in some systems, and transporting it can result in a fine or bounty if scanned by system security.
