The **asteroid belt**, aka main belt, is a circumstellar disc between Mars and Jupiter. It contains many objects such as small and large rocks. The biggest object is the dwarf planet Ceres. Other large objects are the asteroids Vesta, Pallas and 10 Hygiea.^[1]^

Planets that are between the sun (Sol) and the Asteroid Belt are called inner planets. These are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Planets outside the Asteroid Belt are called outer planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.
