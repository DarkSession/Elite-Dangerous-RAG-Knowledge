## Sample Values and Details

Vista Genomics redemption values for samples obtained with the Genetic Sampler are listed below. Values are fixed, but samples that qualify as "First Logged" will reward five times the amount listed below. Also listed are the Clonal Colony Range, the minimum distance a player must travel before there is sufficient genetic diversity to scan a second or third sample, as well as any primary attributes that can help determine on what type of planet they will usually be found.
