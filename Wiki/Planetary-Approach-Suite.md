The **Planetary Approach Suite** is a specialised module that complements Thrusters and allows a ship to enter Orbital Cruise and land on the surface of terrestrial bodies without atmospheres. It is preinstalled in a reserved Optional Internal compartment, and consumes no power or fuel. It is the predecessor of the Advanced Planetary Approach Suite.

## Usage

The functions of the Planetary Approach Suite are fully automatic. All that a pilot must do in order to use it is to ensure it is installed on their ship. Upon approaching a planetary body and entering Orbital Cruise, the Planetary Approach Suite will activate additional HUD elements to help orient the pilot. If the pilot attempts to land on a suitable body, the module also activates and maintains Glide mode once the ship descends to an altitude of 25 kilometers.

## Notes

- The Planetary Approach Suite is equipped by default on all ships that the player purchases while *Elite Dangerous: Horizons* is installed. If the player acquired any ships before installing *Horizons*, the module must be manually purchased and equipped on those ships. Horizons merged with the base game on 27 Oct 2020. Since then all ships are pre-equipped with the PAS.
