## Notes

- Players who start a new game in *Elite Dangerous*, do not own *Elite Dangerous: Horizons*, and do not choose to begin pilot training in Dromi will first spawn at Trevithick Dock in LHS 3447 with a loan Sidewinder MkI.

## Trivia

- Despite initially being the only starting system in *Elite Dangerous* and thus the first system experienced by thousands of players, LHS 3447 was at no time the most-visited system in the galaxy: *"It may come as a surprise that the starting system isn't the most-visited system in the galaxy. Sneaking a peek behind the curtain a little bit: the player's starting system isn't recorded, only the first destination you jump to, so LHS 3447 gets no head start over other systems."*^[1]^
