**Flow Control** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to modules through Engineering. It reduces the power draw of a module by 10%.

## Applicability

This effect can be applied to the following modules:

- Power Distributor
- Shield Booster
- All weapon modules except Experimentals and Mining Tools
- Shield Cell Bank
