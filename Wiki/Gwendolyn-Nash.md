**Gwendolyn Nash** is an independent journalist who reports for the Vox Galactica News Feed. In 3305, she reported on the Eotienses A 3 emancipation crisis brought about by the abrupt liberation of 4,000 Imperial Slaves outside the city of Port Isabelle by radical anti-slavery network Autonomy, and in 3306, she provided one of the only accounts of the assassination of Prince Harold Duval amid a government-imposed blackout of Imperial media organisations.

## Timeline

14 SEP 3306

- Prince Harold Duval is dead after a targeted assassination attempt by the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army. The Empire has imposed a media blackout on these events, and no official statement has been made. However, independent journalist Gwendolyn Nash published this on-the-scene report for Vox Galactica: "From interviewing multiple sources, we gather that a single assassin managed to infiltrate Harold Duval's personal transport. He was killed by shipboard guards but not before shooting the Prince at close range. The NMLA claimed responsibility for this attack in its latest propaganda broadcast, which referred to the Duval family as 'imperialist parasites'. The extremist group also demanded that 'Marlinists everywhere must rise up and demand a democratic Republic'. Harold Duval was famously declared unfit for the throne by Emperor Hengist, and has been out of the public eye ever since. He rarely left Capitol but was making an unpublicised journey to visit his daughter Aisling Duval, presumably in response to the recent terrorist attack in the Cemiess system. It remains unknown how the NMLA knew of the Prince's itinerary, or managed to breach security on his ship."^[1]^

- Thousands of forcibly freed Imperial slaves have continued to create turmoil in the capital city of Eotienses A 3. Vox Galactica featured an on-site report by independent journalist Gwendolyn Nash: "Three weeks after being liberated by the radical activist group Autonomy, the emancipated have banded together in their desperation for survival. Many now wield makeshift weapons gathered from the streets. One large group invaded Port Isabelle's spaceport, causing major disruption to flights. There were scenes of conflict when they attempted to hijack the very ships originally used by Autonomy to transport them. Others have besieged government buildings, demanding to be officially enslaved again so they can complete their terms of servitude. Many emancipated individuals still beg on the streets, despite charitable donations by some citizens. With welfare resources overwhelmed by the immigrants, it can only be a matter of time before more drastic solutions are attempted."^[2]^

22 JUN 3305

- Four thousand Imperial slaves have been left stranded on Eotienses A 3 after being forcibly freed by emancipation group Autonomy. Independent journalist Gwendolyn Nash reported for Vox Galactica: "Since being set free outside Port Isabelle, the former slaves have been without food, shelter or income. Many complain that they cannot return home without completing their indentured servitude to pay off debts or fulfil contracts. In desperation, thousands of newly homeless have poured into the city. Many public buildings, such as the Imperial Museum of Culture, have been turned into makeshift camps, with large numbers also begging on the streets. Police and support services are struggling to cope with the unexpected influx of immigrants. Already there have been several clashes between citizens and the emancipated, and such incidents are likely to escalate until a solution is found."^[3]^
