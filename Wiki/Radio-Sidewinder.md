**Radio Sidewinder** is a fan run, immersion boosting radio station set in *Elite Dangerous* and the Elite Universe. They role play interviews, discussions and adverts to make your Elite Dangerous experience the best it can be. It was created by Commander Black-Bart.^[1]^

The station broadcasts a mix of ambient, electro and space themed music to complement and entertain the adventures of commanders. It plays a mix of slower music for explorers and traders and faster tracks for those bounty hunting moments. The playlist also includes *Elite Dangerous* related news (GalNet), jingles, ads, interviews, in-game information and is designed to increase in-game immersion.

Radio Sidewinder is also an Independent player group represented by two Player Minor Factions: **Radio Sidewinder Crew** in Tago, and **Radio Sidewinder Galactic** in Signalis.
