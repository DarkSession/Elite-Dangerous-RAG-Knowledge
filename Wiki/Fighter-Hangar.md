The **Fighter Hangar** is an internal module that can accommodate Ship-Launched Fighters. It is only compatible with a subset of ships that have been specifically designed to hold it. Fighter Hangars allow a ship to deploy Ship-Launched Fighters, and also automatically manufacture replacements for destroyed craft in the thick of combat.

Each Fighter Hangar module has one or more fighter bays, and each bay can carry a different SLF model, including variants with different loadouts. In other words, the more fighter bays that a Fighter Hangar has, the greater the variety of SLFs it can carry. Each bay of a Fighter Hangar also has a maximum SLF capacity that determines how many replacement SLFs that bay can produce; once all replacements are exhausted, the module must be restocked at a port. Fighter Hangar modules do not include any SLFs at the time of purchase, and all SLFs must be purchased separately, just as SRVs must be purchased separately from Planetary Vehicle Hangars.

The Role Panel is used to launch SLFs, determine whether the player or a NPC pilot is controlling the SLF, and to issue orders between the two. Deploying multiple SLFs simultaneously requires a Class 6 or 7 Fighter Hangar and coordination with other players via Multicrew.

The Fighter Hangar module only needs power to launch the SLFs, but not to dock them. If a ship's power output is maxed out while hardpoints are deployed, SLFs will need to be launched before deploying hardpoints, and hardpoints will also need to be retracted in order to deploy any subsequent replacement SLFs.

When a SLF is destroyed there is an 80-second delay while the fighter bay it was deployed from builds a replacement unit. If the Fighter Hangar has two bays and both are stocked with SLFs, however, then the unused SLF in the second bay can be launched immediately since it is already built.^[1]^
