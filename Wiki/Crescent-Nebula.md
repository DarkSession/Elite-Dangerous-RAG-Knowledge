The **Crescent Nebula** (NGC 6888) is in the constellation Cygnus. The nebula is 4,700 light years from Sol.Â It was formed by the final phase of the central massive Wolf-Rayet star WR 136. It shines by spraying gasses of its outer layers into space at 2,000-3,000 km/s. WR 136 will eventually end in a supernova explosion.
