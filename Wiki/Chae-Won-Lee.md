### Occupation

Taurus Mining Ventures megaship captain

Captain **Chae-Won Lee** is the commanding officer of the Heart of Taurus, a megaship owned and operated by Taurus Mining Ventures. On September 17, 3307, Captain Lee deployed the Heart of Taurus and two Banner-Class Bulk Cargo Ships to Pegasi Sector ON-S b4-8 on orders from her employers, who had been hired by Salvation. The convoy carried a cargo of advanced technical components disguised as Basic Medicines that Salvation needed pilots to smuggle to the Rescue Vessels in the nearby Cornsar system in order to assemble an anti-xeno weapon capable of eliminating the Thargoid forces who endangered Cornsar's populace. Captain Lee informed volunteers that they would be given rewards for their help at the Bright Sentinel in Mbooni.

| 1/1 | A message from Taurus Mining Ventures to all ships in the Pegasi Sector ON-S b4-8 system.
<br>This is Captain Chae-Won Lee, commanding the Heart of Taurus. Our company has been contracted by Salvation to spearhead an operation against the Thargoids.<br><br><br>All independent pilots are requested to dock with this megaship, to collect as many units of basic medicines as possible. The cargo needs to be delivered to either of the rescue ships in the Cornsar system. It is imperative that these deliveries are made before Monday the 10th of September.<br><br><br>These commodities are registered as medicinal goods to minimise inspection by the Cornsar authorities, but in truth contain advanced technical components. Individually the shipments have little value, but sufficient quantities of them will enable Salvation's prototype anti-xeno weapon to become operational.<br><br><br>Taurus Mining Ventures has been authorised to reward those who support this initiative. Providing you have delivered the requested cargo, you will be granted entry to the permit-locked Mbooni system on Thursday the 23rd of September.<br><br><br>A modified Class Two Guardian Gauss Cannon, which has increased capacity and burst fire but reduced optimal range, will be offered as payment. This will be waiting for you in storage at our sister ship, the Bright Sentinel.<br><br><br>On behalf of Salvation, I wish you good luck.<br> |
