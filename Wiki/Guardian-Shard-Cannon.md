## Engineer Modifications

The Guardian Shard Cannon can be modified with the Anti-Guardian Zone Resistance, preventing its decay over time in systems or areas where the Thargoids deployed an anti-Guardian field.

## Purchase Locations

The Guardian Shard Cannon is available for purchase at all stations where a Guardian Technology Broker is present after the module has been unlocked.

| Class | Rating | System | Station | Weapon Mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2, 3 | A, C | Shinrarta Dezhra | Jameson Memorial | Fixed, Turret |
| 2, 3 | A, C | Diaguandri | Ray Gateway | Fixed, Turret |
| 2, 3 | A, C | Ix | Scully-Power Station | Fixed, Turret |

## Modified Shard Cannon

Pre-Engineered Class 1 and Class 2 Guardian Shard Cannons with Focused, Long Range, and Penetrator Munitions named "Modified Shard Cannon" can be purchased from the Guardian Technology Broker at  Prospect's Deep (Mbooni 3 a) in Mbooni (permit restricted system, requires allied status with Azimuth Biotech) (the second location where the weapons could be procured, before it's destruction, was the Bright Sentinel- a megaship owned by Azimuth Biotech). Unlike unlocking most other Technology Broker items, which makes them permanently available for purchase with credits at station outfitting services, exchanging the required materials for a Modified Shard Cannon immediately places one module in local storage at no additional cost. The module must also be unlocked repeatedly in order to obtain multiple copies, thus making it a purchase in exchange for materials, aka a Barter, not an unlock. Note that although the included modifications can be removed, Engineers cannot re-apply them or apply any other modifications to these modules.

Purchase (Barter) of each Class 1 version costs the following Materials and Commodities:

- 1 Guardian Weapon Blueprint Fragment
- 3 Guardian Power Conduit
- 3 Guardian Wreckage Components
- 4 Guardian Sentinel Weapon Parts
- 2 Germanium

Purchase (Barter) of each Class 2 version costs the following Materials and Commodities:

- 1 Guardian Weapon Blueprint Fragment
- 5 Guardian Wreckage Components
- 5 Guardian Technology Component
- 4 Germanium
- 2  Power Converter
