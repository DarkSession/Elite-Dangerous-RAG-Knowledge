For any and all purchases the credits will be taken from the Carrier balance, not the commander personal balance.

Installation cost: 250.000.000 CR

Active Service maintenance: 6.500.000 CR / week

Suspended maintenance: 1.800.000 CR / week

Refund amount if service is removed: FULL refund. (Does not include already payed maintenance fees)

If the service is suspended before the weekly payment, the amount owed will correspond to the Suspended amount instead of the full amount, even if the service was active all week. You can dodge the week maintenance fees by removing the service completely before the week payment, since you get a full refund of the service installation cost. 

When the carrier is in the system that allows for it, the owner may purchase bundles of ships to sell on board. Only bundles can be bought, not single ships. Each bundle has its own price, ships and cargo space requirements. The cargo space requirement is the same used by commodities, this makes a carrier jump more expensive the more services and or ships for sale you have on board.

If you purchased a stock that you don't want anymore, or you only have partial of it left, not to worry, you can resell this package stock for its purchase price.

 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 

Example of interface to buy the ship from the Shipyard UI.  

In the following table, a comparison between purchase and selling. The table ships sell prices correspond to the models of ships in the previous table. Please note that these calculations were made with the GAPs of the 31st may 3311. Prices may vary from current in game values.

Note: Even though there are new ships in the game, it is not currently possible to sell them by purchasing any of the existing packs, even though they do show up in the Purchase Ships UI of the Shipyard. It is not possible to lower the sell price more than setting a 0% commission

Important note: If you are the carrier owner, buying from your own carrier does not reduce the stock. However, the carrier does not receive any payment for the transaction. Therefore you can buy as many as you want, even more than there are stocked, but you will not see a cent of increase in the carrier balance. If you raise the commission and you are the owner, you will not see the price increase from your end.
