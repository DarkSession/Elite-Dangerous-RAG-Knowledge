# Reinforced Module
**Reinforced Module** is an engineer modification that can be applied to some modules. It is similar to the Shielded modification in that it increases module integrity, but at the cost of increased mass rather than power draw.

It is available in 5 grades, with the highest grade offering up to 250% increase in module integrity.
