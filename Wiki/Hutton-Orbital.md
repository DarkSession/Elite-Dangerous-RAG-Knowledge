**Hutton Orbital** is an Outpost located in the Alpha Centauri system. It orbits Eden, which orbits the star Proxima Centauri.

Hutton Orbital is notorious for being extremely far from the system's hyperspace jump arrival point at Alpha Centauri A. The distance is 6,784,404 ls, or 0.22 ly. It takes about an hour and a half at full throttle to get to Hutton Orbital from the arrival point. Note: this time can be shortened with the SCO frame shift drive, but requires more fuel.

Hutton Orbital is the home of two rare commodities: Centauri Mega Gin and The Hutton Mug.

## Notes

- There was a community vote for a new rare item, and The Hutton Mug idea was submitted and won.^[1]^ This led to a community goal to ship scrap to Hutton Orbital to start production.^[2]^ It was a success, in spite of a player-instigated blockade.^[3]^
- Hutton Orbital has a counterpart in Eol Procul Centauri in the Colonia Region named Hutton Moon. However, Hutton Moon is only 35.27 ls away from the arrival star.
- There is a well-known joke that players can get a free Anaconda by simply visiting Hutton Orbital. This is impossible, as Hutton Orbital has no large Landing Pads or Shipyard. The joke is aimed at inexperienced players to try and get them to embark on the lengthy journey to Hutton Orbital and waste their time.
- Hutton Orbital is the modern incarnation of the Eden station in classical Elite versions such as *Frontier: Elite II*. This station also took a very long time to travel to.
