Aleoida
 		 	 

> 
> 
> Extremely hardy photosynthetic organisms that thrive in arid environments. Thick, waxy leaf structures protect them from extreme surroundings. When gaseous exchange becomes unfavourable. the leaves can completely shut off the organism from the atmosphere causing a state of hibernation. The pointed leaves create precipitation slopes, which draw liquids to the heart of the organism. Here they are absorbed through a series of specialised cells, and stored in the root structure until needed.

## Description

Aleoida (likely *aloe* + *-oid*) is named after their resemblance of aloe.

## Types

There are five known types of Aleoida with differing base values:

| SPECIES | VALUE |
| --- | --- |
| Aleoida Arcus | 7,252,500 |
| Aleoida Coronamus | 6,284,600 |
| Aleoida Gravis | 12,934,900 |
| Aleoida Laminiae | 3,385,200 |
| Aleoida Spica | 3,385,200 |

## Distance

Minimum distance between two genetic samples: 150 m

## Conditions of occurrence

- Planets with thin atmosphere of Carbon dioxide or Ammonia
- Because of the types of atmospheres: only Rocky or High Metal Content planets
- Maximum gravity: 0.27
