# Outcrop
An Outcrop targeted by a Scarab SRV
 		 	 

An **Outcrop** is a source of Raw Materials that can be found anywhere on the surface of terrestrial planets and moons. They can be detected with a Scarab's Wave Scanner, and appear on it as two lines, far apart, accompanied by a clicking auditory cue. When destroyed by weapons fire from a ship or SRV, Outcrops drop non-metal Raw Materials, which can be collected using a Cargo Scoop. Each chunk of a material yields three units of that specific material.
