**Argent's Claim**, originally designated **Alioth 5c**, then named **New California** from 2621 to 3230, is the third moon of the gas giant Alioth 5 in the Alioth system. It is a terraformed Earth-like World, and is orbited by the Coriolis Starport Gotham Park.

## History

After the Federation and the Empire worked together to quash a rebellion in Alioth in 2618, the two superpowers agreed to divide the system's assets. The Federation retained the moon Fruitcake as a Federal Protectorate which was renamed Gordonworld, while the system's existing space facilities were ceded to Imperial control. To expand its foothold in Alioth, in 2621 the Empire chose one of Gordonworld's two sister moons, a barren rock they named New California, to test experimental rapid terraforming techniques. The terraforming succeeded, and the newly-habitable moon was established as an Imperial colony. Many residents of Gordonworld defected to New California in pursuit of the Empire's promises of a better life.^[1]^

However, the experimental techniques used on New California eventually proved to have unforeseen effects on the genetic structure of its residents. These genetic defects became apparent by 2853, and exploded into a humanitarian and public relations disaster for the Empire. The local government on New California lost control of the situation in 2854 when Emperor Trasken Duval II enacted martial law on the moon so that the population could be subjected to a mandatory genetic correction programme. A sect of insurrectionists known as the "New Cakers" launched a coup to prevent the programme, which the Empire responded to by bombarding population centres from orbit. The Federation had anticipated this escalation and a Federal Navy fleet under Admiral Kracer arrived shortly after the bombardment began, driving off the Imperial forces. Kracer's intervention was cheered by the people of New California, and Federal Congress was even petitioned to formally approve New California as a Federal protectorate, but the motion was deferred indefinitely and never again raised for a vote.^[1]^

Alioth experienced a harsh economic depression throughout the 30th century caused by a spate of corporate warfare between Federal and Imperial proxy companies over the system's hydrocarbon and mining rights that began in 2924. The people of New California and Gordonworld suffered as the cost of living increased, taxes were raised, and a new social underclass was created. The impoverished were forced to either flee from the cities and settle in the old Caker hideouts, or accept absurdly exploitative employment contracts with the corporations.^[1]^

Following the liberation of Alioth from both Federal and Imperial forces and the establishment of the Alliance in 3230, New California was officially renamed Argent's Claim after Meredith Argent, one of the Alliance's co-founders.
