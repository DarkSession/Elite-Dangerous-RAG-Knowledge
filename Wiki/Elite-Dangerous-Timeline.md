This is the timeline of *Elite Dangerous*. The contemporary *Elite Dangerous* narrative begins in September 3300 and progresses in real-time. Currently, the year is **3311**.^[1]^ There are some timeline disparities with the previous games of the Elite series, but it is set in the same fictional Elite Universe.

*Elite Dangerous* features a shared narrative which is influenced by players on all platforms. This occurs with community events, Community Goals and Powerplay activities. All meta data of the galaxy is shared between players. It is not traditional storytelling, rather an interactive, overarching narrative. Players have influenced and changed the course of events. The story unfolds in real time, in which players can decide the outcomes and be the stars.

GalNet is the official source for galactic news. Tourist Beacons and Listening Posts feature official lore about a wide range of topics. The official role-playing game handbook *Elite Encounters* and the *Elite Dangerous Role Playing Game* contain in-depth guides to the lore. The Commander Chronicles is a series of cinematic shorts set within the game.

## Ancient history

- Many millions of years ago - The Thargoid species develops an interstellar civilisation.
- 1-2 million years ago - The Guardian species develops civilisation on an unidentified world in an unidentified system somewhere in the Inner Orion Spur.
- The First Guardian Civil War occurs, resulting in the unification of the Guardians under a single global government.
- The Guardians expand into space and build many interstellar colonies across the galaxy.
- The Thargoids return to a region of space that they seeded with barnacles long ago and find many of its systems have been settled by the Guardians in their absence. To reclaim what they see as their territory, the Thargoids instigate the Guardian-Thargoid War.
- The Guardians create sentient robots known as the Constructs in an effort to counter the Thargoid invasion. Eventually, the Constructs overwhelm the Thargoids, who opt to withdraw from the war and cede the disputed territory to the Guardians rather than endure more losses.
- Technological advancements made during the Guardian-Thargoid War cause controversy in Guardian society, eventually dividing it into two main ideologies: the anti-technology traditionalists and the pro-technology progressives. The traditionalists gain control of the Guardian homeworld and expel all progressives, while the progressive powerbase establishes itself in the Guardians' interstellar colonies.
- The Second Guardian Civil War occurs between the traditionalists and the progressives. By the end of the century-long conflict, the progressives emerge victorious, but they are then wiped out by their own Constructs, who had come to view the Guardians as an existential threat. The Guardian species is rendered extinct.

## 20th century

### 1955

- On Earth in the Sol system, the Space Race begins amidst the Cold War and the nuclear arms race. The United States of America and the Soviet Union compete to be the first to achieve several space-based technological milestones.

### 1957

- The Soviet Union takes the lead in the Space Race when it launches Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite.

### 1961

- Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union becomes the first man to travel to and return from space.

### 1963

- Valentina Tereshkova of the Soviet Union become the first woman to travel to and return from space.

### 1969

- The United States launches the Apollo 11 mission. Neil Armstrong becomes the first man to walk on the Moon. Buzz Aldrin, part of the same mission, becomes the second.

### 1975

### 1977

- The United States launches the Voyager program, sending the probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 to study the outer planets of Sol.

### 1994

- Following a detente in the Space Race and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and the Russian Federation collaborate on the Shuttle-Mir program.

### 1998

- The space agencies of the United States, Russia, Japan, Europe, and Canada participate in the International Space Station program.

## 21st century

### 2030s

- Major resource problems force humanity to look to the stars once again for a way to relieve population pressures on Earth. Commercial organisations plan missions to build the first colonies on the Moon and Mars, as well as explore the rest of Sol for possible safe havens as political tensions on Earth come to a boil.^[3]^

### 2044

- World War III begins. Intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying thermonuclear warheads with explosive yields of 45 megatons are commonly used by various countries in multiple, well-documented nuclear exchanges. Only the United States of America is able to avoid suffering any nuclear detonations on its soil during the war thanks to its defensive laser grid, which combined ground turrets with armed satellites to disable inbound enemy missiles before they reached their targets.^[4]^ The global nuclear conflict sets space exploration back decades.^[5]^

### 2055

- World War III concludes.^[4]^ Over one billion people perished in the conflict, and many countries collapsed.^[3]^ The victorious United States of America absorbs its neighbors and becomes the United States of the Americas, cementing its position as Earth's dominant power. As the planet's other remaining countries join it over the next several decades, the United States of the Americas eventually renames itself the "Federation of the United States", and then simply the "Federation" when the last countries join and it assumes the role of Earth's global government.^[5]^^[3]^

### 2097

- The first generation ship is launched from Sol to colonize an extrasolar system. In the years that follow, over 70,000 generation ships would be launched, with many still traveling through space to their destinations over a millennium later.^[6]^
- Towards the end of the 21st century, permanent colonies finally become viable on the Moon and Mars.^[5]^

## 22nd century

- The first hyperdrive is invented by a team led by Li Qin Jao, spurring an explosive wave of exploration and colonization beyond Sol.^[7]^

### 2151

- Following the return of an interstellar probe sent to the Tau Ceti system, the first human colony outside of Sol is established in Tau Ceti on Tau Ceti 2, where the first alien life is also discovered.^[8]^^[3]^

### 2159

- The colony on Tau Ceti 2 becomes self-sufficient and elects a civilian administrator.^[8]^

### 2160

- From 2160 to 2179, almost three-quarters of Earth's productivity is geared towards interstellar colonial efforts.^[3]^

### 2161

- John Taylor, an advocate for protecting the lives of colonists over preserving indigenous alien ecosystems, is elected civilian administrator of the Tau Ceti 2 colony and immediately pushes for independence from Earth. In response and at the behest of the colony's corporate backers, a delegation arrives from Earth and finds widespread active destruction of the planet's native ecosystem. The Authority for Ecological Control issues guidelines for habitat conservation and recommends a follow-up delegation be sent in twelve months to monitor the situation.^[9]^

### 2163

- The second delegation mandated by the Authority for Ecological Control arrives in Tau Ceti and finds the degradation of Tau Ceti 2 to have worsened. Trade sanctions are imposed on the colony, but this action only strengthens John Taylor's support among the colonists.^[9]^

### 2165

- John Taylor proposes a referendum on Tau Ceti's independence from The Federation. The referendum is defeated, but narrowly.^[9]^

### 2182

- Indigenous life at an early stage of its evolution is discovered in the Delta Pavonis system, but is wiped out soon after by a human-caused bacteriological accident.^[10]^

### 2190

- Between 2190 and 2230, the systems Delta Pavonis, Altair, and Beta Hydri are fully explored and colonised.^[11]^

## 23rd century

### 2200s

- The implementation of the Earth Environmental Recovery Programme in the 23rd century demonstrates considerable success in restoring polluted and radioactive regions on Earth.^[12]^ As a result, agreements are reached with Beta Hydri and Altair to preserve their native ecosystems in exchange for further self-determination. Delta Pavonis later joins the agreement and pledges to act with restraint towards any further life found in the system.^[13]^

### 2228

- An undercover documentary makes its way to Earth that exposes further ecological transgressions and unmitigated resource exploitation by Tau Ceti colonists under the rule of John Taylor, now well into his eighties. Earth assembles a military taskforce to Tau Ceti to revoke its colonial charter.^[14]^

### 2240

- In the hours before the arrival of the fleet from Earth in Tau Ceti, the main settlement changes its name to Taylor Colony and approves an independence referendum. Lacking starships of their own, the colonists target the Earth fleet dropships as they attempt to land, but this fails to stop the invasion. When the Battle of Taylor Colony stalemates, both sides are forced back into diplomacy.^[15]^^[3]^

### 2242

- The Federal Accord, born from the negotiations between Earth and Taylor Colony, is enacted, transforming the Federation from the global government of Earth into an interstellar federal union. The induction of Taylor Colony in Tau Ceti, followed by Delta Pavonis, Altair, and Beta Hydri, marked the Federation's rise as the first interstellar human power.^[15]^^[7]^

### 2280

- A small object known as the Martian Relic, the first alien artefact ever documented, is discovered buried on Mars. As the Martian Relic was confiscated by the Federation shortly afterwards, it has been shrouded in secrecy for centuries, with its existence only confirmed by leaked Federal records. All that is known about the object is that it is artificial, it was not created by humans, and it measures no more than a few centimetres square.^[16]^^[17]^

### 2288

- Independent colonists arrive in the Eotienses system and begin terraforming Eotienses A 3.^[18]^

### 2290

- The terraformation of Mars is completed. Many Earth-based corporations and government organisations would begin transferring their operations there over the following years.^[3]^

### 2292

- Marlin Duval, a wealthy anti-Federation activist born on Earth, spearheads the colonization of Achenar 6d in the Achenar system. Marlin founds the independent Republic of Achenar, a democratic state based on peaceful ideals.^[3]^^[19]^

### 2296

- Marlin Duval perishes in an apparent shuttle accident with her partner and children. Her brother, Henson Duval, assumes control of the Republic of Achenar's senate as Marlin's closest living heir, then disbands the Republic's ruling council and appoints himself leader in its place, marking the transformation of the Republic into the Empire. Henson's popularity grows as he replaces his sister's pacifism and egalitarianism with jingoism and authoritarianism, in addition to fanning anti-Federation sentiment. Centuries later, historians would suspect that Henson was behind Marlin's death.^[3]^
- The colonization of Achenar 6d results in the extinction of the world's native intelligent species, the mudlarks, in a few short years, despite Marlin Duval's efforts to protect them and ensure they were treated as equals.^[3]^ Imperial scholars suggest that multiple factors, including imported bacteria carried to the world by colonists led to the tragedy, while the Federation maintains that the world was deliberately sterilized prior to terraforming under Henson Duval's orders.^[19]^

## 24th century

### 2304

- Human settlers arrive in Arcturus. The planet Discovery is found to have life in the early stages of its development, but the settlers replace it with an Earth-like ecosystem adapted for the red light of the system's red giant star.^[20]^

### 2312

- December 21 - Isabelle Patreus, a botanist and ancestor of Denton Patreus, founds the first settlement on Eotienses A 3. The event is later celebrated annually in the system by the holiday of Planetfall.^[18]^

### 2314

- The Eotienses system votes by majority referendum to join the fledgling Empire.^[18]^

### 2320

- Henson Duval is formally crowned as the first Emperor of the Empire.^[21]^

### 2324

- The Battle of Achenar, known within the Empire as the "Great Battle of Liberation", begins. It is notable as the first large-scale interstellar conflict. The Federation invades Achenar, seeking to forcibly bring the system into the fold under the pretext of removing the government for committing genocide against Achenar 6d's natives. While the principal reason for the invasion was years of rejected invitations for the Empire to peacefully join the Federation, the protection of xeno-culture and life forms was a key tenet of the Federation’s founding.^[22]^ Upon arrival, the Federation fleet is surprised to encounter heavy resistance in the form of the newly-constructed Imperial "People's Fleet".^[3]^

### 2325

- The Battle of Achenar ends. Outmatched and worn down by the Imperial military while disadvantaged by a long and fragile supply line, the Federal invasion fleet is forced to retreat. Independent colonies begin to flock to the Empire's banner as a consequence of the Federation's humiliation, and the Empire becomes the second human superpower. The Federation refuses to recognize the Empire's legitimacy.^[3]^
- The Federal fleet holds its ground in Beta Hydri bolstered by improved supply.^[22]^ Lingering friction and an ongoing conflict over the Beta Hydri system results in a cold war between the Federation and Empire.^[3]^

### 2339

- Sirius Corporation founds the first entirely corporation-run colony in the Sirius system, and quickly grows into a major interstellar conglomerate after emerging as the premier supplier of drive fuel in human space.^[23]^^[3]^

### 2379

- Sirius Corporation mediates negotiations between the Federation and the Empire to end the cold war.^[3]^

### 2381

- Negotiations between the Federation and the Empire conclude in a formal peace treaty. As part of the terms of the treaty, the Federation agrees to grant Achenar and its colonies full autonomy, and recognizes the hereditary title of Emperor.^[3]^
- Emperor Henson Duval orders the construction of the Hall of Martyrs, a monument to the 16,032 citizens of Achenar who died in the Battle of Achenar.^[3]^

### 2398

- The Federation launches a new wave of colonial missions to locate new resources. One of these missions eventually discovers Alioth.^[24]^

## 25th century

### 2402

- Emperor Henson Duval dies, and is succeeded by Saik Duval.^[21]^

### 2412

- The region that would later become known as the Old Worlds is first explored and colonized.^[3]^ The Colonial Deep Space Cruisers *Herschel* and *Oberon* arrive in the L-453 system, which would be renamed Lave.^[25]^

### 2413

- The first colony fleet arrives in Leesti, setting up mining facilities and processing plants.^[26]^

### 2416

- Lave, Leesti, and Zaonce become self-sufficient and declare their autonomy from nearby supply routes.^[3]^

### 2422

- An expedition from Lave explores the Diso system. Within a decade, the planet Birmingham is colonized and its potential for agriculture is discovered.^[27]^

### 2452

- Alioth is first colonized, with the first settlement established on Alioth 5b and named "Fruitcake" after the world's soft, moist soil and plentiful pockets of minerals.^[3]^

### 2463

- Sirius Corporation enters Alioth to stake a claim on the system's gas mining rights, but is stymied by the presence of two other corporations, leading to armed conflict. After Imperial vessels arrive, claiming to have been sent to protect the local population, Sirius Corporation appeals to the Federation for assistance.^[3]^

### 2480

- The Federation grants the system van Maanen's Star to the Guardians of the Free Spirit, an ascetic religious sect.^[28]^

### 2483

- Emperor Saik Duval dies, and is succeeded by Trasken Duval.^[21]^
- Colonies within the Old Worlds region band together to form the Old Worlds Coalition, a loose mutual defence pact intended to deter Imperial expansion into its territory.^[3]^

### 2498

- The Empire launches an offensive against the Old Worlds Coalition after the destruction of a listening post in the Morten-Marte system, an act blamed on the Coalition. The invasion catches the Coalition off-guard, and it is forced to accede to Imperial demands for it to disband its merchant reserve navy and restrict fleet activity to trade and exploration only.^[3]^

## 26th century

### 2541

- Emperor Trasken Duval dies, and is succeeded by Hennick Duval.^[21]^
- The Caker movement emerges on Fruitcake in Alioth following years of resentment against the heavy-handed Imperial regime that controlled the moon.^[3]^

### 2559

- A Caker group hijacks the Imperial tourist liner Everichon in Alioth. Before the hijackers can crash the ship into one of the system's gas giants, Imperial commandoes retake it. The incident is later dramatised in the holo-vid broadcast "Rebel Madness".^[29]^

### 2594

- Federal Congress passes two highly significant laws revising the Federation's structure. The controversial first act dramatically reduced the total number of Congressmen seats to 500 beginning in the next round of public elections. Previously, under the Federation's colonial charter, every member state was entitled to its own Congressman to represent them in Congress, but the Federation's continued expansion and the constant admission of new members meant that Congress had become excessively bloated and slow to make decisions.^[30]^ The second act, the 77th amendment to the Federal Accord,^[31]^ altered the tenure of the President of the Federation from a maximum of two four-year terms to a single eight-year term with an automatic vote of no confidence in Congress after the first four years. This change was made in recognition of political reality: Federal Presidents serving two consecutive terms were commonplace, and they only rarely faced any credible opposition in what was increasingly referred to as a "mid-term" election.^[30]^

### 2599

- Sadiq Kessler is elected President of the Federation, and serves until 2607.^[32]^

## 27th century

### 2600

- Federal President Sadiq Kessler removes all remaining charter requirements from Alioth's Federal Membership criteria, offering the system de-facto full membership in the Federation. Kessler hoped that the move would garner enough local support in Alioth to give the Federation a key advantage against the Empire in the ongoing struggle for control of the system. Instead, the offer divided Alioth's resistance movement, the Cakers, into pro-Federation and pro-independence factions.^[3]^

### 2603

- In Alioth, the pro-independence faction of the Cakers prevails over the pro-Federation faction after a period of infighting. Quentin Devises secures control of the Cakers and the planet Fruitcake, and declares that Alioth will be made into a port of free trade.^[3]^

### 2604

- Emperor Hennick Duval dies, and is succeeded by Lucius Duval.^[21]^

### 2606

- In Alioth, Federal diplomats meet with Caker leader Quentin Devises after three years of petitioning, only to be informed in no uncertain terms that President Sadiq Kessler's offer of Federal membership was denied.^[3]^

### 2618

- In Alioth, munitions worker Tom Quaterson is tried and executed for selling food coupons to the poor, triggering a general uprising backed by the Cakers and other rebel groups. The residence of the Governor of Fruitcake is stormed, and workers seize control of gas platforms and demand Alioth's independence. In an unprecedented move, the Federation and Empire cooperate to retake the system. Quentin Devises is quickly captured and executed. The two superpowers agree to divide Alioth's assets, with Fruitcake becoming a Federal Protectorate renamed Gordonworld after Federal General Charles C. Gordon, and all local space facilities falling under Imperial rule.^[3]^

### 2621

- The Birthright Wars, a series of conflicts instigated by corporations to seize hereditary land and resource claims from colonists, begin in Federation territories.^[33]^
- In Alioth, the Empire successfully uses experimental rapid-terraforming techniques to terraform the world of New California. Many residents of Gordonworld defect to New California in response to the Empire's promises of a "new life".^[3]^

### 2684

- Emperor Lucius Duval dies, and is succeeded by Anders Duval.^[21]^

### 2690

- The September Uprisings occur on Riedquat. The colony's government had been set up and enforced by the Old Worlds Coalition, but as much of the administration was off-world, it lost touch with the needs of the people of Riedquat and its popularity cratered. The government is overthrown in a violent revolution, and the former officials are executed, with their bodies heaped at the capital city's spaceport. Riedquat descends into a state of bloody anarchy that persists for the next five centuries, and Coalition officials begin an extensive reevaluation of their policies.^[3]^

### 2696

- The Galactic Cooperative of Worlds is established. Following the Old Worlds Coalition's failure on Riedquat, its member worlds reorganize into a new trade organisation that emphasizes the principles of economic self-reliance, mutual defence, and political independence. GalCop's resulting withdrawal from trade with the Federation and Empire provokes the ire of both superpowers.^[3]^
- Terraforming is completed on the planet Conversion in Achenar.^[19]^

## 28th century

### 2700

- The first iteration of the Python, then manufactured by GalCop corporation Whatt and Pritney Constructions, debuts. The Python's innovative modular design pioneers a new era in accessible space travel, spurring the rise of independent pilots.^[3]^

### 2702

- As the Birthright Wars continue, the Federation begins reorganizing its military. In the past, Federal fleets had been assembled by mustering resources directly from Federal member systems, but the rise of interstellar corporations allowed the Federation to contract the construction and maintenance of centralized fleets. The first of these modern fleets is commissioned and trained in Anlave.^[34]^

### 2708

- The Birthright Wars enter their final stage. The descendants of the original, exiled colonists of Anlave who were displaced by corporate activity invade the system and bombard the Federal Naval Academy at Anderton. A fleet of privateers soon follows, but they are beaten back by Admiral Ghenkis B'nami.^[34]^

### 2735

- The Birthright Wars conclude, with Federal corporations having successfully seized land and resource rights from numerous colonies.^[33]^

### 2739

- Emperor Anders Duval dies, and is succeeded by Hender Duval.^[21]^

### 2762

- The Viper Defence Craft, a product of Faulcon Manspace and the predecessor of the Viper II, Viper MkIII, and Viper MkIV, debuts.

### 2799

- Emperor Hender Duval dies, and is succeeded by Trasken Duval II.^[21]^

## 29th century

### 2810s

- Beginning in the 2810s and continuing into the 2840s, GalCop documents a significant number of ship disappearances within its space and near the Pleiades Nebula. Investigations find no evidence of foul-play, but the disappearances and other strange phenomena continue intermittently, stoking anxiety among pilots. These incidents are later believed to have been early encounters with Thargoids.^[3]^

### 2849

- In 2849, the first grainy footage surfaces of one of these "encounters", with one blurry image appearing to show an alien ship with the word "THARG" on its hull. The media immediately coins the term "Thargoid" as a name for the aliens. However, no conclusive proof of the Thargoids' existence is obtained, and they fade into folklore.^[3]^

### 2854

- Imperial soldiers instigate martial law on New California in Alioth and attempt to impose a genetic correction programme on the population. This is prevented by a coup against the military garrison by a new Caker sect, which sent an appeal to the Federation for assistance. A fierce battle ensues, with the Imperial Navy carrying out orbital bombardments. The battle escalates when a Federal fleet led by Admiral Kracer arrives, eventually forcing the Imperial ships to retreat. When Admiral Kracer lands on New California with his marines, they are received by cheering crowds in the capital.^[35]^

### 2855

- Paynou, Prossett and Salem debut the first iteration of the Cobra multirole ship.^[3]^

### 2856

- The first iteration of the Anaconda, then manufactured by RimLiner Galactic, debuts.

### 2858

- Emperor Trasken Duval II dies, and is succeeded by Trasken Duval III.^[21]^
- Faulcon Manspace debuts the Asp, a heavy fighter spacecraft and predecessor of the Asp MkII. The Asp becomes a mainstay in GalCop's Galactic Navy.^[3]^

### 2862

- Isaac Gellan is elected President of the Federation, and serves until 2866.^[32]^

### 2864

- President Isaac Gellan mobilises the Federal Navy to invade the Ackwada system. Unknown to the public, the invasion's goal is to dismantle the Rockforth Corporation, which provided illegal loans to Gellan's election campaign that Gellan refused to repay.^[36]^

### 2865

- The Rockforth Corporation sends a request to Emperor Trasken III for aid against the Federation in Ackwada, offering a substantial monetary reward. Traken III assembles a battlegroup led by the privateer Samuel Lanner which succeeds in expelling the Federal fleet. The Rockforth Corporation pays Trasken III for his assistance and hires Lanner's privateers as a security force.^[37]^

### 2866

- President Isaac Gellan loses his vote of no-confidence and leaves office. In what became known as the Gellan Scandal, the extent of his corruption comes to light and a number of Federal Congressmen are implicated. In the period of increased scrutiny that follows, corporations reduce their involvement in Federal politics.^[38]^
- Olaf Smith is elected President of the Federation, and serves until 2874.^[32]^

### 2867

- President Olaf Smith sends a Federal fleet to investigate after several traders disappear near Zelada. When more traders disappear in Ququve and Aymiay, the Federation fortifies the Laedla system into a major military hub to defend against an apparent "alien threat". Smith's claims that he was *"driving away the alien threat"* make him immensely popular, although it is never proven if Thargoid or other alien activity was behind the disappearances. Smith's actions result in the enhancement of the Federal Navy, and go a long way towards restoring public trust in the presidency following the corrupt Gellan administration.^[39]^ Decades later, a pirate known as "The Black Prince" claimed he was responsible for the attacks, and that the attacks only stopped because he and his cohorts retired. The Black Prince's story is widely disputed, but some assert his claims were simply an exaggerated version of a mostly true but seedier story.^[40]^

### 2872

- Former Federal President Isaac Gellan emerges from prison with most of his wealth intact. He hires a mercenary fleet to settle his score with the Rockforth Corporation. However, Samuel Lanner remained on retainer and led a modern and well-equipped fleet that easily overwhelms Gellan's mercenaries. The defeat leaves Gellan humiliated and financially diminished.^[41]^

### 2874

- Jeremy Tann is elected President of the Federation, and serves until 2882.^[32]^

### 2876

- President Jeremy Tann launches an offensive in the Phekda system and economic instability and civil war throw it into chaos. A military governor is imposed and an attempt is made to repatriate the system into the Federation.^[42]^

### 2878

- The Asp MkII, a militarized predecessor of the civilian Asp Explorer, debuts.

### 2897

- With the Federal repatriation of Phekda a failure, the Federation abandons the system.^[42]^

## 30th century

- October 28 - The Adamastor enters an unknown system. The system's name and what the Adamastor was doing there are erased from the ship's logs.^[61]^
- October 29 - The Adamastor enters Synuefe XE-Y c17-7. It checks in with a listening post orbiting the third body and receives new orders to divert to Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 and pick up Professor Carver's survey team.^[61]^
- October 30 - The Adamastor arrives in Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 and begins extracting the survey team and its research using Sidewinders. The appearance of possible Thargoid vessels and a firefight within Geological Survey 23B likely instigated by Pharmasapien sleeper agents causes the Adamastor's crew to make an emergency departure. The surveyors and mercenaries who are left behind perish or are abducted. The last doomed survivor is Dr. Dominic Murphy, who concealed himself and witnessed the apparent attack, but may have been killed by Thargoids.^[60]^^[61]^
- October 31 - The Adamastor experiences crippling malfunctions induced by the Thargoid object, forcing it to frequently drop out of hyperspace to conduct repairs.

Kelemen speculates that Pharmasapien learned about Azimuth's probes discovering signs of non-human activity.
- July 13 - Pharmasapien operatives massacre the captured Azimuth employees and steer the Hesperus towards the California Nebula. Lieutenant Kelemen's party opts to escape using the Proteus, the Hesperus's secondary exploration craft, and continue the search for alien artefacts in nearby systems, while Private Velasco remains behind to sabotage the Pharmasapien personnel.
- July 22 - Junior Engineer O'Neill, a Pharmasapien operative, embarks on an EVA excursion to check the comms array of the Hesperus while it is in the Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system. When O'Neill reenters the ship, they find it has been flooded with toxic gas and all Pharmasapien personnel are dead. O'Neill is now the only person alive on the Hesperus. O'Neill determines that Private Velasco released the gas into the ship's ventilation system, but is unable to decontaminate the ship and has only a limited supply of oxygen canisters with which to survive.
- July - The Proteus arrives in Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 and discovers multiple Thargoid shipwrecks and a Guardian ruins site on planet 1 A. The ship lands to investigate, and is eventually converted into a research facility. Attempts are made to contact Azimuth Biochemicals for rescue, but no response is received because Pharmasapien's agents had sabotaged the Hesperus's signal beacons.
- September 21 - Lieutenant Kelemen resumes recording official reports and describes the recent activities of the Hesperus survivors, which are focused on studying the alien ruins and artefacts of Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 1 A.
- September 23 - Lieutenant Kelemen and the Azimuth scientists retrieve a crystal from the Guardian site and transport it to the Proteus for study.
- September 26 - An experiment with the Guardian crystal goes wrong, releasing a surge of radiation that kills all of the Hesperus survivors in a matter of hours. Lieutenant Kelemen spends his last moments recording a log of the disaster and revealing that Azimuth's goal in searching for alien technology had always been to weaponise it for profit.

During Aisling's visit, Hadrian was re-confirmed via genetic testing to be descended from the late Emperor Hengist Duval.
- April 11 - The Children of Tothos cult is forcibly disbanded. In light of the Archambault Terminal incident, the FIA pledges to review other fringe religions to prevent further tragedies. Questions are also raised about nuclear research regulation, and whether weapons similar to the Lucifer Device have been secretly developed by other groups.
- April 12 - Events surrounding Rackham Capital Investments take a strange turn when the FIA denies it is investigating the organization, as Zachary Rackham is a member of the FIA Civilian Oversight Board in good standing and there is no evidence of criminality within RCI. Bryanna Blanco disputes this, explaining that credentialed FIA agents had come to the Federal Times' offices and taken its files on RCI and its executives.
- April 13 - Aisling Duval's meeting with Hadrian Duval causes controversy throughout the Empire.

- May 31 - The official search for starship thief Gan Romero is suspended after all leads are exhausted. Commander Bjorn Lennox, the owner of the stolen ship, speculates that Romero stole his vessel specifically because it was outfitted with a high jump and Romero's dreams were driving him to a distant, unknown location.

#### June 3305

- June 1 - Admiral Frederick Yamamoto is arrested by Alliance Interpol and charged with the assassination of Alliance presidential candidate Fazia Silva. The Wallglass Investigations Agency, hired by Silva's sister Tashmira, found that Yamamoto had personally hired a professional assassin with a background in the Alliance Defence Force to carry out the murder. The Council of Admirals takes joint command of the Zaonce ADF fleet while Yamamoto awaits trial. President Gibson Kincaid does not comment on the matter.

- June 7 - To avoid life imprisonment, Frederick Yamamoto confesses that in addition to the assassination of Fazia Silva, he committed other crimes on Alliance President Gibson Kincaid's direct orders. Yamamoto was part of a wider conspiracy that involved other influential corporate, military, and political figures seeking to curry favor with Kincaid, including a senior Bank of Zaonce director who diverted funds to Kincaid's re-election campaign. Kincaid's goal was to move the Alliance's capital from Alioth to Zaonce, with the long-term purpose of establishing himself as the Alliance's supreme ruler.
- June 8 - Tilbery Construction CEO Garrett Kline announces the purchase of 4,000 Imperial slaves as a workforce for the construction of a new water treatment facility for the city of Port Isabelle on Eotienses A 3. Anti-slavery charity Unchain lodges a complaint with authorities in Eotienses, citing the potential for violation of the terms of the slaves' indentured servitude and Tilbery Construction's apparent inexperience.
- June 13 - Evangeline's Elite Expeditionary Force requests superconductors, computer components, and insulating membranes for the construction of a new Megaship in the Shana Bei system.
- June 13 - Alliance President Gibson Kincaid is removed from office by a vote of the Alliance Assembly and charged with treason, murder, and corruption. Kincaid was detained by Alliance Interpol while attempting to flee his estate, and several other conspirators were arrested separately. Key evidence at their trials will be the Wallglass Investigations Agency report and Frederick Yamamoto's testimony.
- June 15 - Tilbery Construction reveals it is a front for the radical anti-slavery group Autonomy, which opposes Imperial slavery and forcibly emancipates slaves. The 4,000 Imperial slaves that Tilbery Construction purchased are transported outside Port Isabelle upon delivery and promptly liberated.
- June 21 - The Alliance Assembly votes to amend the Alliance constitution and dissolve the office of President of the Alliance, citing Gibson Kincaid's crimes as proof that the position is vulnerable to abuse.

As police and support services struggle to cope, clashes between the former slaves and local citizens are reported.
- June 27 - Princess Aisling Duval, speaking in her capacity as CEO of anti-slavery charity Unchain, condemns the emancipation of Imperial Slaves by Autonomy on Eotienses A 3. Aisling explains that under Imperial law, Imperial Slaves require more care during the manumission process to ensure their well-being, but Autonomy recklessly abandoned thousands in Port Isabelle with no employment or protection.
- June 29 - Jan Sandoval, one of the founders of the Red Family drug cartel, turns herself in to the Federal Intelligence Agency and offers to testify against the cartel's leading members, which would dismantle the organization. She enters protective custody, and Executive Agent Viola Trask takes charge of her case.

#### July 3305

- July 3 - Distant Worlds II project leader Erimus Kamzel announces that the DSSV Distant Worlds mobile megaship and the Event Horizon Science Relay installation have finally begun operations at Stuemeae FG-Y d7561.

- July 4 - As meta-alloy harvests in the Pleiades slow dramatically amidst claims that many Thargoid barnacles have been exhausted, Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis Research announces an initiative to identify alternative Thargoid barnacle sites by collecting and analyzing exploration data supplied by independent pilots.
- July 5 - FIA headquarters in Olympus Village, Mars is infiltrated by a mercenary hit squad seeking to assassinate Red Family member-turned-informant Jan Sandoval. The assassins are exposed by security systems and neutralized before they can reach Sandoval, but the incident represents an unprecedented breach of the FIA's most secure facility and reinforces the value of Sandoval's testimony.
- July 6 - Thousands of freed Imperial Slaves continue to cause turmoil in Port Isabelle. Journalist Gwendolyn Nash reports that the emancipated have formed armed bands. One group invades Port Isabelle's spaceport and attempts to seize the transports used to bring them to Eotienses A 3, while others besiege government buildings and demand official reinstatement as Imperial Slaves.
- July 11 - Aegis Research announces that new Thargoid barnacle sites had been found in the Witch Head Nebula. The Alliance, Empire, and Federation send advance teams to the region and launch concurrent campaigns for resources to be used in the construction of new Ocellus Starports and Megaships there.
- July 11 - In a matter of hours, the Thargoids completely withdraw from the Core Systems and the Pleiades Nebula with the exception of the Maia and Merope systems. Aegis is uncertain why the Thargoids departed, but theorizes that their numbers may have been depleted or they are changing their strategy. Professor Ishmael Palin warns that though this is a significant development, it is in no way indicative that the war with the Thargoids has concluded.
- July 11 - Jan Sandoval reveals to FIA Executive Agent Viola Trask that she turned herself in because the Red Family had recently engineered a dangerous new designer narcotic that was more addictive than any other substance on the black market, and which could potentially ruin or end billions of lives in Federal space. Sandoval opposed the drug, but when she failed to stop its production, she then turned to the authorities for help. Red Family operations have already begun to be disrupted by FIA field agents.
- July 13 - An Imperial Internal Security Service taskforce detains all 4,000 liberated Imperial Slaves stranded at Port Isabelle pending discussions with local authorities to resolve their plight. The IISS also arrests Garrett Kline and other Autonomy members for their part in instigating the crisis, and Kline is additionally charged with manslaughter for crushing several ex-slaves with his ship while attempting to flee a riot.
- July 18 - The Thargoids return to the Pleiades Nebula, with Aegis asserting that they are likely refocusing on reclaiming the region. In addition to attacking three stations without being detected by Eagle Eye, the Thargoids mass in Maia and assault Palin Research Centre. Professor Ishmael Palin and his staff evacuate to the megaship Carson's Spring, which is besieged before it can depart the system.
- July 19 - The FIA conducts a series of raids on Red Family bases and manufacturing plants. Dozens of cartel members are killed and thousands arrested in what is hailed as a successful operation to dismantle the decades-old Red Family. It is widely expected that the arrest of Oberon Church will soon follow.
- July 20 - Anti-slavery charity Unchain purchases the 4,000 Imperial Slaves that had been stranded on Eotienses A 3. Princess Aisling Duval acknowledges the irony, and explains that it was a practical solution to the suffering caused by Autonomy. The slaves will be given proper care and pay off their debts by helping to construct a new Unchain headquarters in Port Isabelle, after which they will regain citizenship.
- July 22 - Carson's Spring escapes Maia and arrives in the Arque system thanks to the efforts of independent pilots fending off Thargoid attacks. Professor Ishmael Palin begins transferring his staff and equipment to Abel Laboratory on Arque 4 E.
- July 25 - Six Ocellus Starports arrive in the Witch Head Nebula as part of Aegis' colonization initiative, but are immediately attacked by Thargoids acting in defense of their territory.

- July 30 - Professor Ishmael Palin resumes his research and Engineering services at Abel Laboratory on Arque 4 e. The megaship Carson's Spring departs Arque to take on new duties.
- July 31 - Thargoid forces in the Witch Head Nebula are defeated, and humanity's colonial assets are firmly established in the region. The Alliance, Empire, and Federation officially declare the nebula to be a human enclave which they will share equally. Professor Alba Tesreau asks the galactic community to support the repair effort for the nebula stations so that harvesting of the local barnacle sites can begin.

#### August 3305

- August 2 - The Red Family is dealt a mortal blow as the FIA conducts a series of coordinated strikes and destroys the cartel's super-addictive narcotic before it could be mass-produced. Oberon Church continues to elude capture, however, and internal investigations into the death of Jan Sandoval while in FIA custody indicate that Church may have bribed FIA officials to enable her assassination.
- August 2 - As the first week of the Alliance Festival of Culture concludes, Lave residents share mixed feelings about the event. Some point out that Lave is now controlled by Lave Radio, an independent faction, and assert that the festival is Alliance propaganda. Lave Radio representative Dr. Allen Stroud opines, *"We're all just trying to get along and there's much to celebrate about the Alliance, regardless of whether your system is a current or former member."*
- August 3 - The Alliance Festival of Culture continues in Leesti for its second week. The highlight was a cinematic showcase at the station George Lucas, which included Hal Raskin's historical drama "Unity". The film controversially depicts Alliance founders Mic Turner and Meredith Argent as rivals who faked their romance to rally political support.
- August 6 - The enclave at the Witch Head Nebula attracts thousands of migrants looking for a fresh start, including Chloe Sedesi, a former apprentice of Professor Ishmael Palin. Sedesi plans to open her own Engineering base at Cinder Dock in Witch Head Sector DL-Y d17. A Tech Broker and Material Trader will also set up shop in the region after the starports have been repaired.
- August 8 - Seven planetary ports are established in the Witch Head Nebula, including Chloe Sedesi's workshop at Cinder Dock. After last minute discussions aboard the megaship Spirit of Minue, a Tech Broker and Material Trader also open their services in the region ahead of schedule. With the starport Ezra Point already restored and repairs on the other five progressing swiftly, it was confirmed that more facilities would be added in the coming weeks.
- August 10 - The third week of the Alliance Festival of Culture moves to the Phekda system, where a massive music festival presents megastars like Spectacular Nemesis and Jade Graceland and up-and-comers like The Lasting Hold. Other performers include the Topaz Philharmonic, and legendary singer-songwriter Xiona.

#### September 3305

- September 6 - The Alliance Festival of Culture's seventh and final week holds a culinary celebration in Diso. Dishes range from home-cooked recipes using the local specialty, Diso Ma Corn, to delicacies such as Baked Greebles. The distillers of Lavian Brandy even sponsor a multi-storey cocktail bar. The occasion is marked with a speech by Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, who offers his gratitude to participants and attendees.
- September 13 - Dr Genevieve Kane of the Interstellar Association for Agriculture announces that below-average crop yields are expected across the Core Systems based on audits of key agricultural worlds such as Diso and Orerve. An investigation is launched into the cause, and the IAA begins reviewing options to prevent a shortage, such as the implementation of synthetic treatments to enhance the fertility of cropland.
- September 18 - The Rockforth Corporation announces a new product, synthetically-enhanced EX7 fertiliser, in response to low harvests in several systems. While many farmers begin using EX7, Dr. Genevieve Kane of the IAA warns that Rockforth may have cut corners to get their product to market quickly. Distribution of EX7 is consequently restricted to Marshall Dock in Riedquat.
- September 27 - Sales of Rockforth Corporation's EX7 fertiliser surpass expectations, and the company's share prices rise on the news. Dr Genevieve Kane repeats calls for distribution restrictions, however, noting that Rockforth has yet to provide proper documentation for EX7 to the IAA.

#### October 3305

- October 3 - The impact of low crop yields begins to be felt among the general population. As concerns mount about the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables, some markets and citizens stockpile staple foods. Meanwhile, the Rockforth Corporation announces it will fulfill the Interstellar Association for Agriculture's request for documentation for the EX7 fertiliser at the earliest opportunity.
- October 6 - The IAA confirms that the mass crop failures all have common biological markers with similarities to known pathogens, and that farmers have reported healthy crops withering in a matter of days. The cause of the failures remains under investigation. Local populations intensify panic buying and stockpiling of staple foods, and leaders such as Governor Nadeem Clayton of Orerve attempt to calm the public.
- October 10 - To counter the crop failures, Crimson State Limited in Diso and Orerve Universal Limited in Orerve launch two parallel initiatives requesting delivers of pesticides, synthetic reagents, and grain. Dr Genevieve Kane of the IAA suggests the initiatives may prevent the crop shortage from becoming a crisis. She also announces that the investigation into the crop failures turned up evidence of a new form of blight.
- October 11 - The commodity appeals in Diso and Orerve set off a wave of civil unrest in several systems, as civilians fear their local governments cannot prevent a famine. Charitable aid foundations such as the Galactic Welfare Trust attempt to alleviate the shortages by distributing food cartridges, but find themselves overwhelmed by the scale of the problem and call on food manufacturers to reduce prices.
- October 14 - The IAA concludes that the crop failures are caused by a new strain of blight, but remain unable to determine its origin and vectors. The IAA partners with the Vandermeer Corporation for its molecular diagnostics experience. Public speculation abounds as the blight's source and political enemies blame each other, increasing tensions in afflicted systems to dangerous levels and raising the spectre of war.
- October 16 - The IAA identifies Rockforth Corporation's EX7 fertiliser as the cause of the blight. The original poor harvests were found to have been caused by natural factors and could have been contained had EX7 not exacerbated the problem. Although the trade appeals in Diso and Orerve blunted local food shortages, blight is reported in hundreds of other systems. The IAA asks pilots to collect EX7 and turn it in for disposal at Wiley Port, Tevari. Lakon Spaceways supports the initiative by lowering the cost of the Type-6 Transporter, Type-7 Transporter, and Type-9 Heavy, and stations also offer cargo racks at a discount.
- October 18 - The Federation, Empire, and Alliance announce the creation of a collaborative body charged with investigating how and why Rockforth Fertiliser became corrupted. Rockforth Corporation marketing director Rex Whitlock states the company is at a loss to explain why EX7 causes the blight, insisting it was rigorously tested before distribution, and affirms Rockforth will cooperate fully with the investigation.
- October 20 - The tri-superpower taskforce identifies the cause of the blight as a pathogen-promoting chemical compound used to sabotage Rockforth Fertiliser during the manufacturing process. The investigation turns to the contaminant's point of origin and the motives of the saboteur, though journalist Adalyn Cross notes that Rockforth Corporation remains under scrutiny for negligence in its regulatory checks. Starports increase cargo checks amid news that the blight may be spreading to non-agricultural systems through contaminated goods transported by unsuspecting traders.
- October 22 - The contaminant is traced to the Scythe of Panem, an extremist group from Kappa Fornacis. Scythe of Panem members, seeking revenge for the Federation's 3301 campaign to eradicate Onion Head, had infiltrated Rockforth Corporation factories in Riedquat and sabotaged EX7 fertiliser with a compound derived from Federation biocides. When investigators locate Scythe of Panem cells in Quator, the group responds with unprovoked violence, endangering civilians. The Bruthanvan Co minor faction leads the effort to neutralise the activists and requests support from the galactic community.
- October 23 - The Vandermeer Corporation reports that the blight-causing pathogen introduced to crops by EX7 has mutated, becoming a self-sufficient and aggressive disease that could spread disastrously without proper containment. Vandermeer teams up with Neomedical Industries to find a treatment. In related news, Zander Lachance of the Coalition for Onion Head Legalisation explains the origins of the Scythe of Panem, revealing that the group recently attracted radical anti-capitalists that influenced its violent new direction.
- October 24 - Dr Genevieve Kane of the IAA announces the development of an agronomic treatment that could counteract the blight. The new commodity was a collaborative effort between the IAA, Rockforth Corporation, Vandermeer Corporation, and Neomedical Industries. Kane requests that pilots transport the treatment from manufacturers in six systems to Diso and Orerve, which were among the first systems affected by the blight, as a trial run before beginning wider distribution.
- October 26 - As the galaxy copes with the fruit and vegetable shortages brought on by the blight, Vox Galactica journalist Adalyn Cross highlights the many ways society has been affected: preserved-food brands return, chefs develop new recipes, alternative crops are imported and paid for through tax increases, and the fishing industry booms as people turn to seafood. Unfortunately, billions have become dependent on food cartridges and ration packs, and welfare charities find themselves stretched thin.
- October 28 - Independent pilots neutralise the Scythe of Panem and its leaders in Quator. Other members of the extremist group were arrested after a raid was conducted on an unregistered facility discovered beneath the surface port of Weber Settlement.
- October 31 - The initiatives to deliver the agronomic treatment to Diso and Orerve successfully prove its effectiveness against the blight pathogen, saving numerous crops. The IAA announces that the threat of further food shortages has been curtailed, and agronomic treatment will be mass produced for use against any lingering traces of the blight.

#### November 3305

- November 2 - The Interstellar Association for Agriculture reports that the agronomic treatment has eliminated the blight from all affected systems. With crops rejuvenating, the availability of staple foods returns to normal levels. In the aftermath of the blight, the IAA pledges to intensify agricultural product screenings, intelligence agencies reevaluate their anti-terrorism strategies with an emphasis on potential biochemical attacks, and Rockforth Corporation conducts an internal review and begins rebuilding its damaged reputation.
- November 5 - Rockforth Corporation CEO Sylvia Rockforth apologises for her company's role in the spread of the blight pathogen via its EX7 fertiliser. Several Rockforth employees are terminated for the roles in the incident, including Rex Whitlock due to his dismissal of regulatory practices. In related news, the IAA confirms that the agronomic treatment has become available in thousands of systems.
- November 8 - An ancient generation ship with a living population, The Golconda, is discovered in Upaniklis after it issues a distress signal that is picked up by a local listening post. The vessel's inhabitants report a severe lack of maintenance materials and medical supplies aboard, as well as a lethal viral outbreak. Upaniklis Vision Incorporated sponsors an initiative to collect various commodities for The Golconda at Fozard Port.
- November 11 - Professor Elizabeth Perez, head of anthropology at Orion Independent University, meets with representatives of Upaniklis Vision Incorporated who have had the opportunity to deliver supplies to the Golconda to ask them about the culture of the ship's inhabitants. She urges the galactic community to be cautious about its interactions with the Golconda for the sake of preserving its unique culture.
- November 14 - The initiative to provide The Golconda with supplies concludes successfully. The Interstellar Health Organisation also announces that the modern antivirals given to the colonists have made inroads against the "wasting kiss" outbreak. Meanwhile, media coverage in Upaniklis has fueled public speculation that the colonists should abandon their ship and establish a new home in the system.
- November 15 - The Federation and the Empire deploy two megaships, Keller's Resolve and The Lucent Embrace, to Upaniklis along with two proposals for integrating The Golconda into the galactic community. Imperial Senator Ava Cornelius announces plans to help the colonists complete their original mission by building a planetary base that will be given Imperial protection, while Federal Congressman Harlan Turk counters that the colonists are honorary Federal citizens due to their origin in Sol and declares their spacefaring way of life should be respected through the construction of an orbital outpost.
- November 18 - After engineering experts confirm that The Golconda can no longer adequately support its growing population, the generation ship's leaders reluctantly agree to abandon the vessel, but Captain Jonathon Forester insists that the colonists remain together. The Empire and the Federation set their proposals in motion and launch competing resource drives at their respective megaships in Upaniklis.
- November 22 - As a token of gratitude for the assistance provided by authorities in Upaniklis, the inhabitants of The Golconda present a gift of an alcoholic spirit called Apa Vietii, which has been distilled using techniques passed down among the colonists since the generation ship launched in the 22nd century.
- November 24 - The Federation wins the bid to build a permanent home for The Golconda's population, which agrees to migrate to the planned orbital outpost and accept status as an autonomous Federal partner. The new outpost will be named Forester's Choice in honour of The Golconda's captain, Jonathon Forester.

#### December 3305

- December 5 - The Golconda generation ship is moved adjacent to the new outpost Forester's Choice in Upaniklis, and the vessel's crew and colonists complete their migration to their new home with a resolve to maintain their unique culture. The Golconda's command crew also confirm that they will continue producing Apa Vietii, and will offer it for sale to traders who visit the outpost. To celebrate this historic event, the Federation announces that all Federal ships will be available for purchase at a special discount.
- December 11 - Dr Roy Casimir of the Holloway Bioscience Institute inaugurates the Holloway Biology Centre, a facility dedicated to xenobiology, on moon 7 g in the Colonia system. The facility's completion comes ten months after it was funded by a resource drive held in Nahuaru. Dr Casimir explains that the long delay had been necessary to redesign the facility, since the original plans were inadequate in scope due to the sheer number of newly-catalogued alien species.
- December 12 - Reorte is selected to host the Alliance's end-of-year festivities, prompting the Reorte Mining Coalition to organize an initiative requesting deliveries of food and drink commodities. At the commencement ceremony, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon encourages gratitude for the continuing state of peace between the three superpowers and the recent cessation of Thargoid incursions.

### 3306

#### January 3306

- January 13 - Colonists in the Witch Head Nebula are caught off-guard by a series of Thargoid incursions following nearly six months of reprieve. Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis Research comments that the Thargoids are likely still set on reclaiming the region for its plentiful barnacle sites. Local authorities are hopeful a local defence force can be organised, but Rewired pundit Kelvin Masters notes that relations between the governing minor factions have become fractious.
- January 14 - Universal Cartographics officially renames fifteen systems in the Witch Head enclave for ease of navigation purposes.

#### June 3306

- June 9 - Brewer Corporation releases the long-awaited Drake-Class Carrier to the public. With 16 landing pads, the ability to offer numerous services, and a 500 ly maximum jump range provided by its capital-class Frame Shift Drive, the new Fleet Carriers are poised to become a groundbreaking tool in the hands of the galaxy's independent pilots.
- June 9 - Professor Katrien Rook of Vitadyne Labs announces that after over a year of delay, negotiations with Federal pharmaceutical manufacturer Vandermeer Corporation to distribute nanomedicines have been completed. The revolutionary nanomeds are made available for purchase at Elion Dock in the Kuma system.

#### September 3306

- September 10 - The Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army, an extremist paramilitary group that seeks to replace the Empire's hereditary Emperors with representation by democratically-elected senators, claims credit for a series of explosions in multiple Imperial starports. The Empire issues a terrorism alert across its emergency broadcast channels requesting assistance in evacuating and repairing Mackenzie Relay in Cemiess, Tsiolkovsky Terminal in Gabjaujis, Garrido Market in LHS 4031, and Muller Terminal in Rabh.
- September 11 - Brewer Corporation announces a partnership with Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd and Steel Castle Inc to upgrade a number of refinery outposts into Orbis and Coriolis starports in order to increase access to markets selling Tritium fuel.
- September 12 - The Federal Attorney's Office concludes its inquiry into the destruction of Starship One in 3301. Though not yet made public, the final report is believed to assert that the vessel's Frame Shift Drive was deliberately sabotaged, and the Federal Intelligence Agency is expected to make an arrest soon.
- September 12 - The Imperial Internal Security Service announces that the NMLA terrorist attacks on Imperial starports were carried out with explosives that had been modified with Thargoid technology. Damage from the bombings had initially caused confusion as it triggered automatic emergency broadcasts designed to summon aid during Thargoid incursions. Celebrations were reported in Imperial fringe systems, where Marlinism remains popular, and the IISS reaffirmed that it had no reason to doubt the NMLA's involvement.
- September 14 - Prince Harold Duval is reportedly assassinated by a lone NMLA gunman who infiltrated the prince's personal ship. Prince Harold was reportedly traveling from Capitol to Cemiess to meet his daughter, Princess Aisling Duval, in response to the recent terrorist attacks. It is not known how the assassin, who was killed by shipboard guards, obtained the prince's itinerary or breached the ship's security.
- September 17 - CEO Susannah Haynes of Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd and Director Dean Bradigan of Steel Castle Inc request commodity deliveries to Tenche and Nagasairu, respectively, for their starport conversion initiatives. Both companies plan to upgrade up to five stations apiece, depending on how much material is delivered. Systems that will benefit from the upgrades include, in order of priority, Fjorgyn, HR 4979, Wolf 294, Lambda-2 Tucanae, Potriti, LHS 4058, Chakpa, Gally Bese, Eta Cephei, and Ninabin.
- September 17 - The Empire ends its media blackout and officially confirms that Prince Harold Duval was assassinated by the NMLA. Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval announces a period of mourning is planned and a state funeral will be held at the Hall of Martyrs on Capitol. The Empire heightens its alert level, and the Imperial Senate approves multiple new counter-terrorism initiatives proposed by Senator Denton Patreus.
- September 18 - Chief Technician Rory Webster, an officer of the Federal Navy Engineering Corps who headed the engineering team of Starship One, is arrested and charged with mass murder and treason for allegedly ordering unauthorised changes to Starship One's hyperdrive that resulted in its destruction in May 3301.
- September 21 - The concurrent commodity campaigns run by Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd and Steel Castle Inc conclude successfully. Preparations begin for Orbis starports to be built in Fjorgyn, HR 4979, Wolf 294, Lambda-2 Tucanae, and Potriti, and for Coriolis starports to be built in LHS 4058, Chakpa, Gally Bese, Eta Cephei, and Ninabin; both projects are scheduled to be completed by October.
- September 21 - The Imperial Herald publishes an obituary of the late Prince Harold Duval.
- September 24 - The state funeral of Prince Harold Duval takes place on Capitol, marking the start of a week-long period of mourning. A memorial ceremony is planned in the Imperial Palace for October 1st, and deliveries of rare commodities are requested to be sent to Oterma Station and Baal to supply the event. In addition to credit rewards, participants are promised an Achenar system permit and discounts on Gutamaya ships.
- September 28 - The trial of Chief Technician Rory Webster begins in the Federal High Court. Webster pleads not guilty. The prosecution reveals that Starship One's power regulators were replaced prior to its launch. Webster had convinced the first investigation this was routine, but one of his subordinates later tried to trace the components' source and found the records had been deleted, which sparked the second inquiry. Webster's lawyers counter that the charges cannot be proven and are motivated by personal grudges.
- September 30 - Senator Denton Patreus deploys Imperial military forces to enforce martial law in Ackwada, Beatis, Chana, and Nahuatl systems with known Marlinist sympathies where the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army is popular. Meanwhile, the Imperial Internal Security Service confirms that the bombs used by the NMLA contained Thargoid caustic enzymes, similar to that found in Enzyme Missile Rack warheads.

#### October 3306

- October 1 - The Imperial Internal Security Service traces the explosives used in the recent NMLA terrorist bombings to the Engineer Liz Ryder and the anarchist Eurybia Blue Mafia. The Empire declares war on the Eurybia Blue Mafia after they refuse to turn over Ryder, and tasks the Keltim Empire League with coordinating the conflict and hiring independent pilots. The Eurybia Blue Mafia counters by claiming they have no involvement with the NMLA and also requesting assistance from pilots.
- October 1 - With the success of the campaign to obtain rare goods for Prince Harold's funeral ceremony, the Empire begins processing Achenar system permits for participants. Gutamaya also begins offering its ships at a 20% discount for a period of one week. Princess Aisling Duval offers her gratitude to the public and pledges her support to all efforts to eliminate the NMLA.
- October 1 - Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd and Steel Castle Inc complete their starport upgrades in all ten planned systems. This results in a fluctuation in demand for certain commodities, resulting in a temporary reduction in their availability and an increase in profits for traders who can supply them.
- October 5 - The trial of Rory Webster comes to a temporary halt as the defendant offers to confess to his crimes and implicate other parties in exchange for the prosection setting aside the death penalty at sentencing. Webster claims he was ordered to sabotage Starship One by certain high-ranking individuals. The Federal Intelligence Agency begins taking his testimony, and the Federal Attorney's Office states a decision on when to the resume the trial will be made in the coming days.
- October 8 - The Eurybia Blue Mafia beats back the Keltim Empire League's offensive in Eurybia, preventing Liz Ryder's arrest.
- October 8 - The Empire mobilises the Regulatory State of Ackwada to subjugate the Duduseklis Empire League, an openly pro-Marlinist faction in control of the Ackwada system which the Imperial Internal Security Service accuses of knowlingly collaborating with the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army. The Duduseklis Empire League proclaims its innocence and asks for help holding back the Imperial invasion long enough to prepare and launch 10 megaships to evacuate Marlinist political refugees to safety.
- October 9 - Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent of the Federal Navy chiefs of staff is arrested by the Federal Intelligence Agency on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and treason in relation to the destruction of Starship One. Rory Webster provided evidence that Vincent ordered him to sabotage Starship One and threatened to harm him if he did not comply. Webster is sentenced to 20 years in prison, while Vincent is placed in a high-security facility to await trial in the coming months.
- October 12 - Liz Ryder publicly confirms that the explosive devices used in the September NMLA terrorist attacks were her designs, but she was not aware that the designs were intended for terrorism or that their payloads would be Thargoid caustic enzymes. Ryder explains that she created the designs under contract for a party that falsely identified itself as the Eurybia Blue Mafia. In return for Ryder providing all information in her possession concerning the contract, the Imperial Internal Security Service rescinds Ryder's arrest warrant.
- October 14 - The Empire completes its blockade of Ackwada, intercepting several Duduseklis Empire League megaships attempting to evacuate Marlinist political refugees. Although Imperial forces arrest numerous Marlinists and begin tracking local NMLA cells for elimination, many smaller ships carrying Marlinists and possible NMLA members slip past the blockade.
- October 15 - The Thargoids launch on assault on the Alliance-controlled systems of Onoros, Lembass, Haki, Wellington, and Shenve in the Witch Head Nebula. With neither Aegis nor the Alliance Defence Force prepared to repel the attack, the Alliance Expedtionary Pact faction calls for aid from independent pilots and anti-xeno groups. To entice pilots, the Technology Broker at Bray Landing in Yuanjia substantially reduces costs for Guardian weapons and modules.
- October 16 - The Empire imposes lockdowns on more Marlinist systems, including 234 G. Carinae, Baltah'Sine, CD-39 3269, HIP 39470, and Mazahuanses. Citizens from these systems as well as the previously secured systems of Beatis, Chana, and Nahuatl evacuate aboard any ships they can find to avoid arrest. As Marlinist leaders protest the Empire's moves as persecution and members of the Imperial Senate voice concerns about mistreatment of Imperial citizens, Denton Patreus insists the Empire's security comes first. The Imperial Navy mounts a search for Marlinist refugee transports, but some reach the Federation.
- October 19 - Lucas Vincent's arrest shocks the Federation. Support for Federal President Zachary Hudson and the Republican Party plummets due to Hudson's friendship with Vincent, which has stoked accusations of a conspiracy to assassinate former President Jasmina Halsey. While Hudson maintains his silence, at least a dozen Congressmen resign in protest, and the Liberal Party enjoys majority support in public opinion polls for the first time in years.
- October 20 - Imperial Ambassador Imogen Luciana issues a formal demand to the Federation to extradite all Marlinist political refugees to the Empire, as hundreds of thousands of Marlinists arrive in the Federal systems of Charunder, Ennead, HIP 36081, LTT 1935, LTT 3607, and Thetis. Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester refuses, noting that there is no extradition treaty between the Federation and Empire for unconvicted individuals, and the Marlinist refugees have requested asylum. The Alliance and some independent systems also announce that they will welcome any Marlinists who enter their territory.
- October 21 - Independent pilots successfully destroy the majority of Thargoid forces assaulting the Witch Head Nebula, and the remainder are driven into a full retreat. To celebrate this victory, the Technology Broker at Bray Landing in Yuanjia extends the discount on Guardian weapons and modules for an additional week.
- October 22 - Humanitarian aid organisation Safeguard Interstellar sponsors a campaign to collect relief supplies for Marlinist refugees in six Federal systems, as local authorities in those systems warn that the influx of people could lead to public unrest and food shortages. Donations are requested to be delivered to Fox Enterprise in LFT 625, where the Fionn Liberals have also promised rewards for hunting wanted ships to ensure the safety of traders.
- October 26 - Federal Congress approves a proposal from Shadow President Felicia Winters to grant safe haven and temporary citizenship to the Marlinist political refugees in Federal space. The proposal overrides President Zachary Hudson's stated intention to deport the Marlinists back the Empire, demonstrating how Hudson's reticence on the arrest of Lucas Vincent has undermined his own authority.
- October 27 - Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval of Nova Imperium is severely wounded by an assassination attempt at his headquarters of Dyson City, Paresa and is hospitalized in critical condition. The Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army claims responsibility for the attack and vows to *"sever every head of the Duval hydra"*.
- October 29 - The Safeguard Interstellar relief campaign collects sufficient supplies to sustain Marlinist populations in LTT 3607, Charunder, and Ennead until support from Federal Congress arrives.
- October 29 - The Adamastor, an abandoned megaship, returns to the Chukchan system after almost two centuries on autopilot and is moved to an orbit over Chukchan 5 B. The Alliance Salvage Guild determines that the Adamastor was designed for clandestine operations and passed near the HIP 61595, HIP 64011, and HIP 65201 systems, but are unable to find any intact records of its original destination or identification. Retired private investigator Benjamin Chester extends his assistance and uncovers that the ship was operated by the now-defunct corporation Azimuth Biochemicals, and that it was also scheduled to pass by the HIP 39748 and HIP 33386 systems. Meanwhile, independent pilots searching the Coalsack Nebula for the source of a mysterious transmission discover a derelict scientific outpost established in 3111 by an Azimuth Biochemicals survey team in Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1, as well as extensive Thargoid activity in the area.
- October 30 - Tensions between the Federation and Empire escalate, with reports emerging that both sides severed a number of official communication channels, as Imperial Ambassador Imogen Luciana repeats the Empire's demand for the Federation to deport all Marlinist immigrants. Some political commentators observe that the Federation granting asylum to the Marlinists could be construed as the mass kidnapping of Imperial citizens and thus an act of war.

#### November 3306

- November 2 - Princess Aisling Duval travels to Paresa aboard the INV Achenar's Courage to offer protection to Hadrian Augustus Duval. The Imperator is transferred to the Majestic Class Interdictor and given advanced medical treatment surrounded by his Praetorian Guard and Imperial troops. Aisling's actions draw both praise and criticism given that Nova Imperium remains outlawed by the Empire for sedition, but Aisling insists she will not allow another Duval to die. Praetor Leo Magnus, who continues to investigate the breach of security at Dyson City, thanks the Princess for her assistance.
- November 3 - After using information provided by Liz Ryder to locate and investigate the NMLA bomb-making facility where the weapons used in the September 10th starport attacks were produced, the Empire finds evidence that the NMLA may be operating a second bomb-making facility in the Federal border system LTT 1935. Imperial Ambassador Imogen Luciana alleges that the Federation may be supporting the NMLA in an effort to destabilize the Empire, and warns there will be consequences if this is confirmed. Meanwhile, LTT 1935 and two other Federal systems, HIP 36081 and Thetis, report civil unrest, food shortages, and epidemics due to having insufficient resources to cope with Marlinist refugees.
- November 5 - The Imperial Internal Security Service enters LTT 1935 to investigate and confirms the presence of multiple hidden NMLA facilities, but is met with armed resistance from local Federal forces under the LTT 1935 Confederacy faction. The IISS calls on reinforcements from the Empire-aligned L.Y.S Corp to occupy LTT 1935, sparking a battle for control of the system. Both sides seek support from independent pilots, and offer Federal and Imperial Navy rank promotions as added rewards.
- November 6 - The NMLA continues its campaign of terror in the Empire, carrying out over fifty bombs attacks on government buildings and security forces that kill hundreds over a three week period, and assassinating multiple high-profile individuals connected to the Duvals, including Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's relative Baron Cesare Lavigny. Critics suggest that the IISS underestimated the NMLA and its anti-terrorism operation radicalised many people with Marlinist sympathies. In the Federation, commentators warn that the LTT 1935 conflict could provoke all-out war, and note that while President Zachary Hudson's support in Congress has declined and Shadow President Felicia Winters holds the initiative, her championing of Imperial refugees does not guarantee their acceptance in Federal society.
- November 9 - The Alliance Assembly announces a joint expedition with several corporations, including Sirius Atmospherics, to secure fresh meta-alloy sources in the Coalsack Nebula that were discovered in connection to the Adamastor ghost ship. Political commentators speculate that the success of the expedition will be key to stabilising the Alliance's economy and shoring up Prime Minister Edmund Mahon's bid for reelection in 3307.
- November 10 - Princess Aisling Duval formally requests that Hadrian Augustus Duval be readmitted into the Imperial Family as Prince Hadrian, signalling a new direction for Nova Imperium. The Imperator confirms that after a discussion with Aisling he has decided to assume his birthright. He urges Imperial authorities to learn from their purge of Nova Imperium and show mercy to the Marlinists, arguing that the Empire must unite in order to face the NMLA.
- November 12 - The Federation-aligned LTT 1935 Confederacy successfully resists the Empire-aligned L.Y.S Corp's attempt to occupy LTT 1935.
- November 12 - The Alliance's initiative to exploit the Coalsack Nebula begins. The Alliance Expeditionary Pact reveals plans to build Betancourt Base starport in Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 and three further outposts: Hannu Arena in Musca Dark Region IM-V c2-24, Cole Point in Coalsack Sector VU-O b6-6, and Bering Port in Coalsack Sector KN-S b4-9. The Alliance Defence Force also asks for volunteers to help reduce the Coalsack Nebula's Thargoid presence.
- November 16 - Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval rejects Princess Aisling Duval's request to grant Hadrian Augustus Duval a royal title or official position within the Imperial Family. Instead, in a proclamation presented to the Senate by Chancellor Anders Blaine, Hadrian is recognized as a Duval by blood and he and his followers are granted pardons for past crimes against the Empire. In addition, the Senate ratifies the Treaty of Paresa, which decriminalizes Nova Imperium in return for accepting Emperor Arissa's rule and contributing in operations against the NMLA.
- November 17 - The initial stage of the Alliance's initiative to exploit the Coalsack Nebula concludes. An enthusiastic response from independent pilots to the supply and defence campaigns helps secure sufficient resources to build all four stations, upgrade the three outposts to starports, and hire Interstellar Factors, Material Traders, and a Technology Broker.
- November 18 - A Federal Security Service operation initiated by Federal Vice President Brad Mitchell identifies nine active NMLA members hiding among Marlinist refugees. The terrorists are detained for interrogation before being turned over to Imperial authorities. Meanwhile, several Federal worlds are gripped by protests demanding all Marlinists be sent back to the Empire due to the risks they pose to safety and the economy, as well as counter-protests calling for the Marlinists to be welcomed by the Federation as fellow believers in democracy.
- November 19 - The NMLA bombs the Federal starport Kepler Orbital in Atropos, and issues a warning to the Federation. The explosives involved are thought to be of the same design and have the same Thargoid enzyme payload as those used in the September attacks in the Empire. The FSS confirms that the nine NMLA members arrested the previous day were being held in secure facilities on Kepler Orbital that were destroyed by the blasts, and it is assumed that the bombing's purpose was to silence the prisoners before they were interrogated.
- November 20 - In the wake of the Kepler Orbital bombing, relations between the Federation and the Empire deteriorate further. Imperial Ambassador Imogen Luciana claims that the Federation invited the bombing by not allowing the Empire to shut down the NMLA's bomb-making facilities in LTT 1935. Several Federal embassies in Imperial systems close after their staff are threatened by violent anti-Marlinist protests. Shadow President Felicia Winters is blamed for the attack by Vice President Brad Mitchell, as well as congressmen displeased by aid being prioritised for Marlinist refugees rather than Federal citizens, and her recent surge in support falters.
- November 23 - A number of mined commodities, including painite, low temperature diamonds, and void opals, see sudden fluctations in price due to increasing market volatility. Financial experts offer various explanations for the price changes, such as a market correction, a result of increasing tensions between the Federation and the Empire, or a minor anomaly that will soon abate. Economics professor Ophelia Kaufmann notes that while demand for some high-value commodities has fallen, prices will likely increase for several low-value commodities, and the outcome of the crisis between the superpowers will affect the severity of future changes.
- November 24 - Core Dynamics makes an official bid to acquire Lakon Spaceways. While Lakon does not immediately respond and questions are raised about whether a merger between corporations partnered with different superpowers would be legal, some industry experts speculate that Lakon could accept the offer since investment in the Alliance Chieftain and its sister ships may have strained the company's finances. Neither the Federal Commerce Authority nor the Independent Commission for Market Equality disapprove the proposal.
- November 26 - The Alliance's four research stations in the Coalsack Nebula begin operations. Chief xenobiologist Dr Rodion Stathos of Betancourt Base in Musca Dark Sector PJ-P b6-1 issues an open request for Thargoid commodities for research purposes.
- November 26 - President Zachary Hudson convinces Federal Congress to approve a funding increase for the Federal Navy in order to expand production of Farragut Battle Cruisers. To fulfill the new production schedule, the Federal Navy asks for deliveries of several commodities to Schweickart City in Parutis. Only hours later, the Imperial Senate approves a similar funding request for the Imperial Navy made by Senator Denton Patreus, and Miyasaka Orbital in Mandh begins accepting commodities for the construction of new Majestic Class Interdictors.
- November 27 - As the Federation and the Empire ramp up military spending and cease cooperating, commentators warn they are on the brink of war. President Zachary Hudson mostly recovers his standing following the Kepler Orbital bombing that killed thousands, while Shadow President Felicia Winters' acceptance of Marlinist refugees loses popularity. Senator Denton Patreus orders the withdrawal of funding from Aegis to change focus from the subsiding Thargoid threat to the Federation and the NMLA.
- November 30 - The value of bounty vouchers is increased galaxy-wide after the rise in superpower military spending leaves local security forces without adequate ships and manpower for policing efforts against piracy and violent crime. Combat bonds remain unaffected.

#### December 3306

- December 1 - Lakon Spaceways chairperson Naomi Landseer turns down Core Dynamics' buyout proposal. The move comes as a surprise due to the ongoing rumours of Lakon's dire financial difficulties, as well as strong pressure from Lakon shareholders who desire the merger and believe Landseer is focusing too much on Alliance contracts. Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester declines to withdraw his bid and mulls his options.
- December 3 - The resource campaigns for the Federal and Imperial Navy construction programmes conclude. The Federal Navy is expected to launch five new Farragut Battle Cruisers to patrol the Atropos, Iman Caber, LHS 142, LFT 367, and Wolf 25 systems. The Imperial Navy is expected to launch four new Majestic Class Interdictors to patrol the Chimechilo, Orannika, Theta Indi, and Zelano systems. Federal Congress and the Imperial Senate also increase funding for support vessels and ground forces.
- December 3 - Sirius Atmospherics project director Dr Maximilian North announces the development of terraforming procredures for ammonia worlds, and launches a campaign to collect detailed scan data on ammonia worlds across the galaxy. The data will be used by Sirius to support plans to terraform ammonia worlds in the Coalsack Nebula for the ongoing Alliance colonisation expedition in the region.
- December 7 - Lakon Spaceways applies a 30% discount on the Asp Scout, Diamondback Scout, Keelback, Type-7 Transporter, and Type-10 Defender through the end of the month. Industry analysts assume that the sale is an attempt to increase Lakon's profits in the short term to assuage shareholders, and Lakon chairperson Naomi Landseer remarks that while Lakon's profits have fallen recently, the company remains financially secure.
- December 8 - Factions increase the rewards for Combat Bonds obtained from both human and Thargoid ships in an effort to boost defences. Professor Ophelia Kaufmann remarks that the ongoing volatility of financial markets brought on by superpower tensions, terrorist attacks, and a Thargoid resurgence have caused widespread revaluation, and factions have prioritised protecting their citizens.
- December 8 - The Marlinist refugee crisis continues to divide the Federation in the wake of the Kepler Orbital bombing. Although Marlinists came forward to expose NMLA members in their midst and the Federal Security Service believes the risk of terrorism from them is now low, Federal Congress becomes deadlocked over whether or not to grant the Marlinists full Federal citizenship.
- December 10 - Dr Maximilian North offers his gratitude for the ammonia world data delivered to Sirius Atmospherics. The data will be used in terraforming simulations, and ammonia worlds in the Coalsack Nebula could one day be inhabitable. At the same time, Commodore Morag Halloran of the Alliance Defence Force observes that anti-xeno security in the Coalsack is insufficient due to the ADF's distance from the nebula, as well as Aegis losing funding from both the Empire and Federation.
- December 10 - To resolve the standoff between the Empire and the Federation over the Marlinist refugees, Sirius Corporation CEO Li Yong-Rui presented a solution: construct up to 10 new self-governing colonies in unclaimed systems for the Marlinists to reside in. Both Federal Congress and the Imperial Senate approved the proposal with the caveat that any identified NMLA members be turned over to Imperial authorities. Marlinist community leader Dr Jenna Fairfax also voiced her approval, as the plan would end the uncertain predicament of her people.
- December 11 - Billionaire Zachary Rackham announces the imminent construction of a permanent orbital outpost in HIP 58832, a remote system over 5,000 light-years above the Core Systems that is commonly considered the galactic zenith or "the Roof of Space". The project is funded by Rackham Capital Investments with assistance from Universal Cartographics and several scientific organisations.
- December 14 - Core Dynamics applies a 30% discount on the Eagle MkII and Vulture, and a 20% discount on the Federal Assault Ship, Federal Dropship, and Federal Gunship through the end of the month to raise funds for a hostile takeover of Lakon Spaceways. A number of Lakon investors are reportedly bribed to give up their shares or coerced into pressuring the Lakon board of directors to accept Core Dynamics' ownership bid.
- December 17 - Rackham's Peak, the outpost constructed by Rackham Capital Investments in the galactic zenith of HIP 58832, celebrates its grand opening. Zachary Rackham himself conducts the facility's inauguration ceremony, and its market begins offering high prices for deliveries of alcoholic beverage commodities.
- December 17 - Sirius Corporation secures enough supplies to construct Marlinist colonies in eight systems: HIP 22550, Hyades Sector RO-P b6-6, LP 659-31, Hyades Sector LX-T c3-30, Hyades Sector SU-C a14-1, and Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2. The colonies are expected be completed and the Marlinist refugees settled there in early 3307. Marlinist leaders offer their gratitude, but also remark that their goal of one day converting the Empire into a democracy has not changed.
- December 17 - In response to the NMLA's manipulation of the engineer Liz Ryder, all engineers across the galaxy open up channels of communication with each other to discuss ways to protect themselves and maintain the public's trust. This results in a collaboration in which the engineers decide to temporarily accept lower grade materials for higher grade modifications until January 7, 3307.
- December 21 - NMLA attacks decrease in frequency as the Imperial Internal Security Service shuts down several cells using information obtained from NMLA members captured by the Federal Security Service. Meanwhile, the Marlinist refugees begin preparing for their transfer to their new colonies next year, which will be handled by Safeguard Interstellar. The Marlinists form a transitional parliament headed by community leaders Dr Jenna Fairfax, Aaron Whyte, and Amrita Ross, and democratic elections are planned once the Marlinist Colonies are fully operational.
- December 22 - In an emergency meeting, a majority of Lakon Spaceways shareholders vote to replace several members of the board of directors who opposed the company joining Core Dynamics, including Chairperson Naomi Landseer. The board's new members pledge that Core Dynamics' original buyout bid will be reconsidered.
- December 24 - A second wave of Marlinist refugees from the Empire begins arriving in the Alliance. Safeguard Interstellar provides basic necessities to the tens of thousands of refugees, while Alliance Interpol runs strict background checks to catch NMLA members. With the Marlinist Colonies still under construction, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon welcomes the Marlinists, but meets growing resistance in the Alliance Assembly. His likely opponent in the 3307 election, Councillor Nakato Kaine, garners significant support for declaring that while the Marlinists will be given aid, the Alliance is not responsible for dealing with the domestic problems of the Empire and Federation.
- December 28 - Sirius Atmospherics project director Dr Maximilian North tempers expectations about the pace of terraforming ammonia worlds in the Coalsack Nebula, revealing that the new terraforming techniques are not as effective as simulations suggested. Independent journalist Flint "Firemaker" Lafosse claims that Sirius's terraforming project is likely a cover for an operation involving the Thargoids. The Alliance corroborates Dr North's report, but separately confirms an influx of Sirius personnel and equipment in the Coalsack.
- December 29 - Lakon Spaceways is threatened with insolvency and dissolution as economic instability plunges its share value to unprecdented lows. Trent Delaney, the new head of Lakon, blames the company's previous leadership for its current plight, and asserts Core Dynamics taking ownership of Lakon will resolve its financial crisis. However, the Independent Commission for Market Equality reports irregularities in recent transfers of Lakon stock to new owners, and some Core Dynamics senior directors allegedly have doubts about CEO Jupiter Rochester's push to acquire Lakon.
- December 31 - The Thargoids launch a coordinated strike against three systems in the Coalsack Nebula and six systems in the Witch Head Nebula. Local security ships report being overwhelmed, and the Alliance Defence Force is too slow to prevent the infestations. Admiral Aden Tanner warns the public that Aegis is unable to adequately respond to the situation due to recent funding and resource cutbacks, and calls on independent pilots to provide assistance in fending off the incursions.

### 3307

#### January 3307

- January 1 - Simguru Pranav Antal of the Utopia commune invites the Alliance, Empire, and Federation to attend a diplomatic conference to resolve their differences in light of the threat posed by recent events such as the Thargoid resurgence, NMLA terrorism, political tensions between the Federation and the Empire, and ongoing galactic economic instability. The proposed Galactic Summit would be a first of its kind meeting between all three superpowers.
- January 4 - Campaign season begins for the Alliance's election for prime minister, scheduled to take place in the Alliance Assembly on February 25, 3307. Incumbent Edmund Mahon faces multiple opponents, but Councillor Nakato Kaine of Tionisla emerges as his foremost rival, rallying the discontent of a faction of the Assembly and speaking out against the Alliance's increased dependence on corporations and the other two superpowers, and its aggressive exploitation of meta-alloys in Thargoid territories.
- January 5 - Lakon Spaceways' board fo directors officially accepts the purchase bid from Core Dynamics, paving the way for the transfer of ownership to formally take place in two months' time. The takeover is approved by the Federal Commerce Authority, but the Independent Commission for Market Equality continues investigating reports of irregularities. Admiral Rachel Ziegler of the Council of Admirals warns the Alliance Assembly that the manufacture of Alliance ships by a foreign power will create security issues for the already overextended Alliance Defence Force.
- January 7 - The Thargoid offensive in the Coalsack and Witch Head Nebulas enters its second week. Thousands of colonists are reported dead, and only two of the nine affected systems are cleared of incursions. Admiral Aden Tanner reiterates that the nebula colonies must rely on independent pilots for protection.
- January 7 - Dr Roy Casimir, chief researcher of the Holloway Bioscience Institute of Colonia, requests deliveries of tissue samples from spaceborne "pod" organisms for study. Sufficient quantities will allow the creation of experimental habitats for these organisms in adjacent systems for long-term research.
- January 8 - Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis pleads for the superpowers to attend the Galactic Summit and restore resources to Aegis as the Thargoid resurgence continues. While there is not yet any official response to Utopia's proposal, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, Princess Aisling Duval, and Shadow President Felicia Winters signal their approval, and there are reports that legislators in each superpower are urging their respective leaders to attend.
- January 11 - The Federal Attorney's Office obtains a grand jury indictment against Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent for conspiracy to commit murder and treason in the Starship One disaster. The trial of Vincent, who is the highest ranking Federal military officer to ever stand trial, is scheduled to begin on January 25, 3307 at the Federal High Court in Olympus Village on Mars.
- January 13 - An anonymous source within Core Dynamics claims to Vox Galactica that CEO Jupiter Rochester has spent years acquiring companies outside the Federation, such as Vodel and Lakon Spaceways, to diversify his family's personal holdings instead of expanding Core Dynamics itself. The source also reveals Rochester has amassed a kind of cult of personality, and several Core Dynamics departments operate almost independently from the rest of the company under the banner of "Jupiter Division". Former Lakon chairperson Naomi Landseer asks the Independent Commission for Market Equality to investigate further.
- January 14 - The Holloway Bioscience Institute receives enough xenological samples to establish experimental habitats for spaceborne organisms in Eol Prou PC-K c9-221, Eol Prou LW-L c8-99, Eol Prou KW-L c8-301, and Eol Prou PC-K c9-154 in the Colonia Nebula. Dr Roy Casimir also hints that research into these organisms may have commercial applications.
- January 14 - Hundreds of millions of Marlinists are relocated to the Marlinist Colonies. The Marlinist factions begin holding democratic elections to determine their leaders, but the transitional parliament declares a state of emergency due to a shortage of food stocks. Dr Jenna Fairfax issues a request for deliveries of food commodities to Stillman Hub in HIP 22550. Bounties are issued on criminal and anti-Marlinist ships to protect traders while local system defence forces are organised.
- January 15 - The Independent Commission for Market Equality reports that Core Dynamics illegally used shell companies to purchase Lakon stock from shareholders, and two serious accusations of blackmail are referred to Alliance Interpol. In the Federation, an editorial published in Sol Today praises Jupiter Rochester for acquiring Lakon and encourages him to break his "Jupiter Division" off into its own company to get away from the apparent jealousy of his Core Dynamics colleagues.
- January 18 - CEO Li Yong-Rui of Sirius Corporation offers to host the proposed Galactic Summit in the Sirius system, declaring that Sirius Corp can provide better security and resources, has warm relationships with all three superpowers, and has most recently demonstrated its impartiality by building the Marlinist Colonies. While the competing proposals from Utopia and Sirius are evaluated, a third offer from Zachary Rackham to host the conference at the actual galactic summit of Rackham's Peak is disregarded.
- January 19 - Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon formally begins his re-election campaign on planet Birmingham in his home system of Diso. He plans to tour systems across the Alliance to tout his accomplishments and rouse support.
- January 20 - Former Federal President Jasmina Halsey returns to Olympus Village at the request of the Federal High Court to provide witness testimony in the trial of Lucas Vincent for the destruction of Starship One.
- January 21 - The Marlinist Colonies elect the inaugural members of the Marlinist Parliament, with Dr Jenna Fairfax becoming First Minister of the new government. Following a robust response to the request for food, Fairfax announces discounts on local commodities to stimulate trade with neighboring systems.
- January 21 - Utopia and Sirius Corporation open competing initiatives at Polevnic and Lembava to gather data materials to be used in the planning of security operations for the Galactic Summit, which is scheduled for late February after the three superpowers provisionally agree to send delegations. The organisation that receives the most data will be deemed the most suitable host for the conference.
- January 22 - During a campaign rally on the planet Leesti, Councillor Nakato Kaine criticises Prime Minister Edmund Mahon for his expansionist policies, and advocates increasing mutual cooperation among Alliance members through investing in trade and security.
- January 25 - The trial of Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent begins. The prosecution presents evidence obtained from Rory Webster, including a recorded transmission from Vincent's office to Starship One on May 24, 3301 ordering the ship to divert to Azaleach for maintenance, where Webster sabotaged it. Vincent insists that the trial is a cover-up and the Liberal Party had Starship One destroyed to elevate then-Secretary of State Felicia Winters to the presidency. Vincent's own counsel downplays his claim and instead argues that Webster's recordings are fabrications.
- January 27 - Jasmina Halsey testifies in the trial of Lucas Vincent. Halsey confirms that Vincent personally ordered Starship One to divert to Azaleach, and recounts her experience of the vessel's destruction. When the defence counsel attempts to call her state of mind into question by presenting her post-recovery descriptions of an encounter with the *"caretakers of the galaxy"*, Halsey reveals she has no memory of making those statements, and provides medical reports from Alliance doctors affirming her sanity.
- January 28 - Sirius Corporation wins the competition to host the Galactic Summit, and begins making preparations. Sirius further clarified that the conference was planned to take place over a three week period in late February and early March.
- January 28 - Commander Elsa Solomon reports receiving a partial distress signal from a ship or place called "Serene Harbour" while travelling through the Swoilz XX-D c1-30 system. The Pilots Federations asks pilots to search within an 80 light-year radius of the system for the signal's source.
- January 28 - The Pilots Federation announces it has received an encrypted transmission related to Serene Harbour that includes planetary surface coordinates and the phrase "Theta Seven".
- January 28 - Independent pilots discover Serene Harbour, an abandoned Imperial Intelligence Service detention facility, on planet 3 B of the R CrA Sector AF-A d42 system. Recovered logs recorded by Commandant Gabriel De Luca indicate that on January 20, Serene Harbour received a group of Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army prisoners designated "Theta Group" who had been captured in LTT 1935. On January 26, Serene Harbour's security systems were disabled remotely, and Imperial troops aboard a supply shuttle killed all prisoners and staff except for Theta Group, whom they departed with. Commandant De Luca speculated that the NMLA had somehow infiltrated Imperial Intelligence.
- January 29 - In the ongoing trial of Lucas Vincent, Jasmina Halsey reveals that in April 3301, she informed her Cabinet of plans to address her low approval rating by cutting the Federal Navy's budget, among other policy changes. It is suggested that this was what motivated Vincent to assassinate her, since the budget cut would have weakened his influence and impacted certain individuals to whom Vincent was illegally connected. Details about Vincent's associates would be provided later in the trial.

#### February 3307

- February 1 - The Alliance Assembly narrowly approves a proposal from Prime Minister Edmund Mahon to delay the upcoming election until May 3307 to avoid conflicting with the Galactic Summit scheduled for late February. Councillor Nakato Kaine blasts Mahon's move as a transparent excuse to prolong his term in office and not befitting a leader of the Alliance.
- February 2 - Evidence presented at the trial of Lucas Vincent reveals that in 3301, the Fleet Admiral and other Federal naval officers had been secretly receiving billions of credits from shell companies created by Core Dynamics. The corporation does not respond to press inquiries, but there are unverified reports of large-scale activity taking place at certain Core Dynamics facilities.
- February 3 - Senator Karl Nerva denies that the Serene Harbour site has any association with Imperial Intelligence or the Empire, and accuses the Federation of fabricating the facility and its logs to stage a disinformation campaign. Nerva does confirm that Captain Gabriel De Luca, Serene Harbour's commandant, was a real person who worked in Imperial Intelligence, but clarifies that De Luca died years ago and seemingly had his identity stolen.
- February 4 - Engineer Liz Ryder issues a request for mined commodities to reduce the expense of making an enhanced Seeker Missile Rack module widely available through Technology Brokers.
- February 5 - On the final day of the trial of Lucas Vincent, the prosecution names Jupiter Rochester as a co-conspirator in the plot to destroy Starship One, claiming that Vincent and the CEO wanted to replace Jasmina Halsey to protect Core Dynamics' profits, since her planned policy change would reduce the company's contracts with the Federal Navy. The defence again questions Halsey's credibility as well as the admissibility of the prosecution's latest evidence. The jury then enters sequestered deliberations. Shortly afterward, reports surface that the Core Dynamics departments collectively known as "Jupiter Division" are transporting ships and personnel to HIP 54530, and the ruling minor faction HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group has renamed itself Jupiter Division.
- February 8 - The Pilots Federation issues an emergency bulletin warning newly-licensed pilots to avoid Fleet Carriers in the HR 6828 system. Fleet Carrier owners there reportedly kidnap newly-licensed pilots by enticing them with a lucrative mining opportunity and then transporting them to a remote system to mine. The pilots' ships usually lack the jump range to depart the system on their own, making them reliant on the Fleet Carriers to return them to the Core Systems.
- February 8 - Lucas Vincent is found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and treason and sentenced to life imprisonment. The Federal Intelligence Agency immediately arrests several co-conspirators in the Federal Navy and government. Jupiter Rochester evades arrest by fleeing to the new Jupiter Division faction in HIP 54530. His involvement in the Starship One disaster furthers conspiracy theories that he is a member of a covert group of figures who manipulate human civilisation to benefit the military/industrial complex. Accusations that President Zachary Hudson was responsible for the disaster are debunked, as Vincent's trial did not present any evidence that Hudson had any knowledge of the plot to eliminate Jasmina Halsey.
- February 9 - In a statement broadcast across all Federal media channels, Jupiter Rochester declares himself the Supreme Executive of Jupiter Division, revealed to be an independent corporate republic. Rochester explains that he founded Jupiter Division to demonstrate that corporate rule would be a superior form of government for the Federation, and hints at future commercial plans.
- February 10 - The Independent Commission for Market Equality finds that former Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester used bribery and blackmail to coerce Lakon shareholders into replacing the company's board of directors to approve the hostile takeover. Core Dynamics, in disarray due to the secession of Jupiter Division, terminates the merger, and Naomi Landseer is reinstalled as chairperson of Lakon. With investor confidence in Lakon plummeting, Sirius Corporation makes its own offer to acquire the shipbuilder.
- February 11 - Jupiter Division goes to war with the Federation-aligned Silver Legal Group in HIP 54530 to secure its presence in the system. Both factions issue calls for assistance in the conflict, and the Pilots Federation grants temporary system permits to all licensed commanders so they can participate. Both factions offer discounts on outfitting at Northrop Enterprise and permanent system permits as rewards.
- February 12 - Liz Ryder's campaign to make her modified Seeker Missile Rack available to pilots through Technology Brokers is a success, and enough resources are gathered to offer the module at a discount.
- February 12 - The Empire and the Marlinist Colonies form delegations to participate in the Galactic Summit, scheduled to open on February 25. The Empire will be represented by Chancellor Anders Blaine, Princess Aisling Duval, and Senator Denton Patreus, in addition to members of the Imperial Diplomatic Corps. Senator Zemina Torval will head the Imperial Senate as acting chancellor in Blaine's absence. The Marlinist delegation will include First Minister Jenna Fairfax and Minister Aaron Whyte, who hope to engage with the Empire diplomatically and establish relations with other governments.
- February 15 - The revelation of Jupiter Rochester's involvement in the Starship One conspiracy stoke a public outcry against corruption and corporate influence in the Federal government. Trust in the Republican Party falls even as President Hudson denies knowledge of the conspiracy, and the Liberal Party is also politically embarrassed by Shadow Vice President Isolde Rochester's ties to the man who funded the assassination attempt against former President Halsey and has now taken up arms against the Federation in HIP 54530.
- February 16 - The Alliance purchases a majority sharehold in Lakon Spaceways, saving the company from insolvency and ensuring a key defence contractor for the Alliance Defence Force will remain out of the hands of another corporation or superpower. Lakon confirms plans to relocate its headquarters to Alioth.
- February 18 - Silver Legal Group defeats Jupiter Division and assumes control of and permit rights to HIP 54530. Jupiter Rochester and thousands of his followers are apprehended by the Federal Intelligence Agency, with Rochester facing trial for his role in the Starship One disaster, and arrangements are made for the return of stolen Core Dynamics assets. Remnants of Jupiter Division flee to HIP 55014 aboard the megaship Victory's Forge.
- February 18 - Sirius Corporation requests deliveries of rare food commodities to Ashby City in Luyten's Star. The luxury goods will be ferried to the Sirius system, where they will be served during the Galactic Summit. Sirius Corp plans to reward participants with permits to Sirius and a specially modified Frame Shift Drive, which will also be made available through Technology Brokers.
- February 19 - Lakon Spaceways finishes moving its administrative hub to Lakon Spaceways Central on Alioth 1 A, and enacts a permanent 5% discount off all of its ships sold at ports in the system. Elsewhere, Federal news feeds report that Core Dynamics is undergoing a rapid restructuring in the wake of the Jupiter Division affair.
- February 22 - President Zachary Hudson and Shadow President Felicia Winters confirm they will be part of the Federation's delegation to the Galactic Summit. Vice President Brad Mitchell will remain behind to oversee the Federal government, as will Shadow Vice President Isolde Rochester, who remains ensnared in the scandals of Jupiter Rochester. In related news, Jupiter's husband, actor Tomas Turai, files for divorce.
- February 23 - Protests against the postponement of the Alliance prime minister election sweep many Allied worlds. Councillor Nakato Kaine gives the protests her full support and becomes a figurehead for public discontent, with some commentators claiming she would have won the election if it had been held as originally scheduled. Kaine decides to attend the Galactic Summit, ostensibly to keep Edmund Mahon in check.
- February 25 - With the completion of the rare food commodities campaign for the Galactic Summit, the first delegations begin arriving in Sirius.
- February 25 - As the Galactic Summit kicks off, Li Yong-Rui announces that the Federation will assist Sirius Corporation in providing security for the conference's first week, followed by the Empire and the Alliance in subsequent weeks. Rewards for participants include a Sirius permit and unique Viper MkIII paintjobs. Also, to celebrate the Galactic Summit, Core Dynamics, Gutamaya, and Lakon Spaceways offer a 10% discount on all of their ships for the event's duration.
- February 26 - The Galactic Summit begins with speeches from Chancellor Anders Blaine, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, and President Zachary Hudson, and the schedule of events is formalised. Among the numerous first meetings between galactic leaders, the Marlinist Colonies delegation is snubbed by Senator Denton Patreus, but received cordially by Shadow President Felicia Winters and her guest, Jasmina Halsey. Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester is notably absent due to the legal scrutiny faced by his family over the Jupiter Division affair.

#### March 3307

- March 1 - A variety of news feeds report that tensions are running high at the Galactic Summit as delegates clash over long-standing issues. Despite this, a spokesperson for Sirius Corporation states that the conference is *"going well"*.
- March 3 - The Alliance, Empire, and Federation ratify a number of small treaties at the Galactic Summit. The most significant is the Cornelius-Lasky Convention, named for sponsors Senator Ava Cornelius and Congressman Kristine Lasky, which requires the three superpowers to share information on large-scale threats to civilian populations. In addition, First Minister Jenna Fairfax formally apologises to Princess Aisling Duval for her father's death and condemns the NMLA, signalling a possible reconciliation between the Marlinists and the Empire.
- March 4 - The Empire assumes partial security responsibilities for the Galactic Summit as it enters its second week. In addition to issuing bounties on criminals, Sirius Corporation requests deliveries of food commodities to keep the conference well-supplied.
- March 4 - Pirate warlord Archon Delaine of the Kumo Crew unexpectedly arrives at Patterson Enterprise and demands to participate in the Galactic Summit as a delegate. Sirius Corporation grants him diplomatic immunity and assures the other delegates that the Kumo pirates will follow all rules and etiquettes. Delaine's presence causes major controversy and some ambassadors leave in protest.
- March 5 - The Federal Justice Department takes the unusual step of summarily sentencing Jupiter Rochester to life imprisonment without a trial. The Federal Attorney's Office's request to investigate Rochester and Vincent for possible other crimes is denied. In related news, Core Dynamics continues its restructuring and purge of Rochester loyalists under new CEO Owen McKenna, and a corporatist movement inspired by Rochester's ideology forms in the Federation and gains support.
- March 8 - Speaking before the Galactic Summit, Archon Delaine demands international recognition of Kumo Crew and its territory as a sovereign state, sparking an intense debate among the other delegates. This comes amid growing suspicions that the criminal ships flocking to Sirius belong to Kumo Crew.
- March 9 - Delegates at the Galactic Summit tentatively agree to increase funding for Aegis on the condition that the organisation produces new anti-Thargoid breakthroughs from its Guardian research. Support builds for Edmund Mahon's Sirius Treaty to increase cooperation against the Thargoids, and Archon Delaine, the Marlinist Colonies, and other independent groups commit to signing it.
- March 10 - Detectives Erik Gunnarson and Francesca Wolfe of the Wallglass Investigations Agency provide an update on the Adamastor ghost ship. The Adamastor was found to have had a sister ship, the Hesperus, which departed for an unknown destination in 3113 and never returned. An examination of Geological Survey 23B also revealed that the battle there may have involved another human faction in addition to the Thargoids, possibly Azimuth Biochemicals' rival Pharmasapien.
- March 11 - The NMLA carries out a wave of bombings at starports in nine major systems, including Achenar, Alioth, Eotienses, Gateway, Kamadhenu, Lave, Nanomam, Rhea, and Sol. Hundreds of thousands are killed, and many more are injured. The Galactic Summit is temporarily suspended while leaders rush to address the attacks, and a lockdown is imposed on Sirius.
- March 11 - The Galactic Summit is cancelled due to fears that Patterson Enterprise in Sirius may be the next target of the NMLA. The delegations return to their home systems, and the Sirius Treaty is left unsigned. The NMLA formally claims responsibility for the attacks, with a broadcast from "Theta Seven" condemning the Alliance and the Federation as imperialist supporters of the Duvals and urging the people of the galaxy to *"retake control"* using the "Nine Martyrs" stations as inspiration and an opportunity.
- March 12 - The Federation confirms that Federal Vice President Brad Mitchell and several Cabinet members were among the tens of thousands killed by the NMLA's bombing of the starport Li Qing Jao in Sol. The Federation also accuses the Empire of being responsible for the March 11 attacks by allowing NMLA bomb-makers to escape from Serene Harbour, while the Imperial Senate insists Serene Harbour has no connection to the Empire. In addition, Marlinists come under criticism from the public, and the Marlinist Colonies repeat their denial of any association with the NMLA.
- March 15 - Internal political tensions emerge within the superpowers as the "Nine Martyrs" stations continue to burn. In the Empire, Senator Denton Patreus is firmly rebuked by Chancellor Anders Blaine for his suggestion to arrest all Marlinists as NMLA collaborators. In the Federation, President Zachary Hudson blasts Shadow President Felicia Winters for providing aid to Marlinist refugees the previous year, accusing her of enabling terrorism. In the Alliance, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon calls for unity against the NMLA, while Councillor Nakato Kaine insinuates that when Mahon chose to attend the Galactic Summit, he prioritised the Alliance's and his own prestige over the lives of the Allied citizens who were lost in the attacks.
- March 17 - The superpowers create the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit (ACT) to investigate and eliminate the NMLA. ACT is jointly led by veterans of the tri-superpower taskforce that dismantled the League of Reparation in 3304: Captain Niamh Seutonia of the Imperial Internal Security Service, Inspector Mara Klatt of Alliance Interpol, and Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez of the Federal Intelligence Agency. The unit plans to coordinate with Federal, Imperial, and Allied security forces, along with the Pilots Federation.
- March 18 - Safeguard Interstellar organises an initiative to distribute Basic and Advanced Medicines to victims of the Nine Martyrs attacks, and establishes three staging sites. Affiliate factions in Duamta, Cemiess, and He Bo offer unique rewards for participants, including a double-engineered 3A Power Plant, a double-engineered 3A Shield Generator, and a Type-6 Transporter, respectively. Damage at eight of the nine bombed stations is contained by local emergency services and repairs begin, but Li Qing Jao in Sol remains an active disaster zone.
- March 19 - Detectives Erik Gunnarson and Francesca Wolfe of the Wallglass Investigations Agency review what is known about the NMLA. One of the lingering questions about the extremist group, which is now responsible for the largest terrorist attack in history, is how they grew from a minor nuisance to an interstellar menace so quickly. More pertinently, the NMLA's ability to bypass security in the superpowers' capital systems and its possible association with alleged double-agents in Imperial Intelligence as evidenced by the Serene Harbour incident means they could be anywhere and strike any time.
- March 22 - ACT begins its investigation of the NMLA. Preliminary findings conclude that the explosives used in the Nine Martyrs attacks had a more compact design, and were likely constructed on-site, making them easier to transport and conceal. ACT also theorises that the NMLA uses an undetectable interstellar communications system similar to that used by the League of Reparation, but more sophisticated.
- March 23 - As several political and military leaders suggest that the Marlinist Colonies should be occupied or destroyed in retaliation for the NMLA's bombings, the Marlinist Parliament again denies having any connection to the NMLA. First Minister Jenna Fairfax condemns the NMLA as an aberration of true Marlinism and announces that a team from the Marlinist Constabulary led by Captain Milo Castile has been sent to assist ACT. Minister Aaron Whyte issues a statement commenting that Neo-Marlinism arose in response to centuries of brutal oppression of republicanism under the Empire.
- March 24 - President Zachary Hudson appoints Secretary of Security Jerome Archer as his new Vice President, and also selects new members for his Cabinet. In an address before Federal Congress, Vice President Archer vows to enhance the Federation's security and prevent a repeat of the Nine Martyrs attacks. President Hudson also receives congressional approval for funding increases for ACT and the Federal Navy.
- March 25 - The Safeguard Interstellar drive for medical supplies is successful, ensuring hundreds of thousands of terrorist attack victims will receive vital treatment. In addition, repairs are completed for six of the nine stations attacked in the Nine Martyrs incident, and fires in the starport Li Qing Jao in Sol are finally extinguished. Dawes Hub in Achenar and Donaldson in Alioth continue the repair process.
- March 25 - Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez, one of the joint leaders of ACT, calls for independent pilots to assist in the search for Captain Niamh Seutonia, who had gone to the Mudhrid system aboard her Anaconda, the Valkyrie, to investigate NMLA activity. The Valkyrie departed Mudhrid on a heading for the Marlinist Colonies on March 24, but failed to arrive at a scheduled rendezvous. Pilots later discover the wreck of the Valkyrie on Trianguli Sector GW-W b1-0 1 A, and learn from recovered logs that the NMLA had apparently lured Captain Seutonia into an ambush.
- March 26 - Jasmina Halsey returns to Federal politics and joins the Federal Diplomatic Corps as an ambassador to the Alliance. The development is praised by Elijah Beck, head of the Alliance Office of Diplomatic Relations. In related news, the FDC recalls Ambassador Jordan Rochester to be reassigned, as most Federal and Imperial embassies in each other's space have remained closed since November 3306.
- March 29 - The Federation and Alliance pressure the Empire to do more to eradicate the NMLA. Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval instructs Chancellor Anders Blaine present a range of options, and Senator Lorcan Scordato volunteers to visit the Marlinist Colonies on a fact-finding mission. Public opinion in the Empire, more polarised on the issue of Marlinism than ever following the Nine Martyrs, appears to strongly favour a military response over diplomacy.
- March 30 - The Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, sponsored by Vice President Jerome Archer, is approved by Federal Congress. The sweeping public surveillance law is classified as emergency legislation and therefore replaces all preexisting laws concerning surveillance of civilians and their communications. Archer touts the law as a way to prevent future terrorist attacks in the Federation, but Shadow President Felicia Winters criticises it as an outrageous violation of civil liberties.
- March 31 - ACT begins its investigation of the Order of Mudhrid, a faction in the Mudhrid system that assisted the NMLA in carrying out the Nine Martyrs bombings. The Order of Mudhrid's activities had been uncovered from the logs left behind by the late Captain Niamh Seutonia. The Imperial Internal Security Service confirms that Captain Seutonia will posthumously receive the Achenar Service Cross.

#### April 3307

- April 1 - After ACT confirms that the Order of Mudhrid provided logistical support for the Nine Martyrs attack, the faction renames itself the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, and its leader, Landgrave Arastin Delacroix, declares a revolution against the Imperial Family. In response, Senator Denton Patreus orders the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group to engage the Order in battle and take revenge for Nine Martyrs. The Marlinist Colonies withhold recognition of the Order, which is the first faction to openly adopt Neo-Marlinism, and Minister Aaron Whyte voices regret that the Landgrave chose violence over providing a political platform for Neo-Marlinists.
- April 2 - In the third installment of their "Galactic Mysteries" series, Detectives Erik Gunnarson and Francesca Wolfe of the Wallglass Investigations Agency discuss generation ships, specifically the ones discovered by independent pilots in recent years, and speculate about the fate of other missing generation ships that have yet to be found.
- April 5 - Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval marries Commander Astrid Minerva, who receives the title Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval, at a secure location. The Imperial Palace and Senate convey congratulatory messages. Among other obervations in Imperial news feeds, the Imperial Herald notes that Hadrian may produce heirs before both Princess Aisling Duval and Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval, neither of whom have consorts.
- April 6 - The Federal Intelligence Agency establishes the Proactive Detection Bureau, led by FIA Deputy Director Bethany Blake, to monitor public and private communications networks for terrorist activity in accordance with the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act.
- April 8 - The Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group defeats the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid in the Mudhrid system. Landgrave Arastin Delacroix eludes capture. Inspector Mara Klatt states that Delacroix was enticed to aid the NMLA after being promised higher status in the NMLA's "Republic" once the Duvals were deposed, a tactic the NMLA is likely using to gain the support of other marginalized leaders within the Empire.
- April 8 - An undeployed listening post found inside the Adamastor ghost ship is automatically activated and begins receiving and rebroadcasting an encoded long-range signal. Independent pilots arriving at the ship to investigate are contacted by an individual calling himself "Salvation" who has an interest in Azimuth Biochemicals' work, and are asked to track down the signal's source. It is traced to the Hesperus, the Adamastor's sister ship, which is found derelict and picked clean by The Scriveners Clan Dredger in Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2.
- April 9 - Senator Lorcan Scordato visits the Marlinist Colonies on a fact-finding mission. In his preliminary report, Scordato observes that the Marlinists are well-organised and retain their Imperial culture, but need more support from the galactic community to fend off power grabs from neighboring systems. Most Marlinists are also furious at the NMLA for causing them to be stereotyped as monsters. Scordato concluded the Marlinist Colonies were unlikely to be NMLA collaborators.
- April 12 - In the fourth installment of "Galactic Mysteries", Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency provides information about the Dredger Clans, nomadic communities who wander the galaxy aboard their Dredger megaships. Francesca Wolfe leaves to confirm rumours of the appearance of a rarely seen Dredger Clan.
- April 13 - The Federation's Proactive Detection Bureau stirs controversy and protest, and even meets opposition from the corporatist movement formed by supporters of Jupiter Division. Some corporations also file legal challenges, fearing the PDB will expose sensitive commercial information, and megacorps Caine Massey and Vandermeer threaten to withdraw political donations.
- April 15 - The Kumo Crew launches an initiative with Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd to construct five new Orbis starports to stimulate galactic trade. Archon Delaine, calling himself the *"sovereign ruler of the Kumo nation"*, explains that he seeks to increase the prosperity of his subjects and expand Kumo Crew's reach. The target systems for the new starports, in order of priority, are Pegasi Sector PN-T c3-14, HIP 18390, HIP 10792, HIP 62154, and Eol Prou PC-K c9-91.
- April 16 - Landgrave Arastin Delacroix and remnants of the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid flee to Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 in the Marlinist Colonies aboard the Steel Majesty. Delacroix requests asylum from Minister Aaron Whyte, leader of the Marlinism Reformation Party faction that controls the system. The Empire, Alliance, and Federation demand that the Neo-Marlinists be apprehended, but cannot legally compel the Marlinist Colonies to do so. The Marlinist Parliament declares an emergency and debates its next steps.
- April 19 - The Pilots Federation opens an inquiry into Salvation after confirming reports from commanders that the secretive individual's decryption key has unraveled the mystery of the Adamastor's signal and helped locate the Hesperus, accomplishing what the authorities failed to do. Some commanders also voice their suspicions that Salvation is recruiting them for something.
- April 20 - Imperial Senator Lorcan Scordato brokers an agreement between the Marlinist Colonies and the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid that also placates the superpowers. In exchange for identifying the NMLA's senior leadership to ACT, Landgrave Arastin Delacroix and his inner circle will receive life imprisonment at a Marlinist detention facility for their role in Nine Martyrs, while the rank-and-file members of the Order will be given the chance to apply for citizenship after submitting to security screening.
- April 21 - Deputy Director Bethany Blake of the FIA reports that the Proactive Detection Bureau has identified over a dozen previously unknown extremist organisations within the Federation, and thousands of individuals were arrested for researching terror tactics, radical ideologies, and other suspicious subjects. Civil rights groups claimed that these groups could have been found via conventional policing methods, and criminologists noted that they were amateurs who were statistically unlikely to carry out attacks.
- April 22 - Archon Delaine thanks the galactic community for ensuring the success of his starport construction initiative. All five planned starports, named Kumo City, California Freeport, Crimson Exchange, Fort Xeno, and Delaine Terminus, are expected to be completed by April 29.
- April 22 - Aegis sets into motion plans to re-analyse Guardian technology to develop more defences against the Thargoids, a committment it had made during the Galactic Summit. Professor Alba Tesreau issues a request for Guardian artefacts to be delivered to the Aegis Research megaship Alexandria in the Delphi system, and offers access to Guardian Gauss Cannons as an extra incentive.
- April 23 - Shadow President Felicia Winters criticises the Proactive Detection Bureau as an unconstitutional violation of data privacy rights outlined in the Federal Accord, and points out that it is incapable of monitoring the dark-comms network that ACT believes the NMLA is using. Civil rights group Advocacy asserts that the data collection infrastructure for the PDB was likely already in place for some time before the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act was implemented. Opinion polls indicate the PDB is supported by a slim majority of Federal citizens.
- April 26 - Flint "Firemaker" Lafosse publishes classified information leaked from ACT by an anonymous source on the Rewired network. The unverified leak contains apparent testimony from Arastin Delacroix that names Hadrian Augustus Duval as the mastermind of the NMLA. Hadrian was allegedly converted to Neo-Marlinism and recruited to the NMLA by his consort, Astrid Minerva, in early 3306, and he used Delacroix's faction to distribute enzyme bombs and Nova Imperium assassins with the goal of eliminating the other Duvals so that he could become Emperor. The attempt on Hadrian's life in October 3306 was also staged to gain the Imperial Family's trust.
- April 27 - Francesca Wolfe reports on the discovery of the Hesperus and The Scriveners Clan Dredger, and provides more details about the Scriveners' culture. The decrypted Hesperus logs downloaded from the Dredger are preserved for posterity in a Tourist Beacon in Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2.
- April 28 - Hadrian Augustus Duval and Astrid Minerva-Duval deny the allegation made by Landgrave Arastin Delacroix that they are leading members of the NMLA after ACT confirms that the leaked files obtained by Flint Lafosse were genuine. The allegation is also criticised by Princess Aisling Duval, but in a statement before the Imperial Senate, Senator Zemina Torval calls for Imperator Hadrian to be punished for rebelling against the Empire. ACT asks for patience while it investigates the Landgrave's claims.
- April 29 - Thanks to a robust response to its call for Guardian artefacts, Aegis is able to begin the early stages of research into new anti-Thargoid weapons and defences.
- April 29 - President Zachary Hudson and Shadow President Felicia Winters launch dueling initiatives related to surveillance in the Federation. Hudson asks for deliveries of data to expand the Proactive Detection Bureau's reach and effectiveness, while Winters requests data to be used to protect personal communications from government intrusion. The outcome of the projects is expected to affect the security and stability of systems where the two politicians have influence.
- April 30 - Archon Delaine's five new starports become operational. Authorities in nearby systems express concern that the stations may be under-staffed or will promote criminal activity. Arch-Corsair Kay Volantyne of the Kumo Council insists that the stations exist solely to encourage trade. Also of note is the presence of several Sirius Corporation divisions at the stations, implying Sirius may have provided Kumo Crew with financial support for the project.

#### May 3307

- May 3 - The Federation-aligned League of Mandu arrives in Paresa aboard the megaship Harmony's Shield to eradicate Nova Imperium amid accusations that the latter group is linked to the NMLA. The Empire-aligned Peraesii Empire Consulate also pledges to purge any NMLA presence in Paresa, and warns the League of Mandu to withdraw. Imperator Hadrian Duval protests his innocence, claiming the NMLA faked his identity in its dealings with the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid. ACT continues investigating Landgrave Arastin Delacroix's claims, and Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval withholds her judgment.
- May 6 - President Zachary Hudson's call for data deliveries defeats Shadow President Felicia Winters's competing campaign, strengthening the Proactive Detection Bureau and boosting security for systems within Hudson's personal sphere of influence. Systems where Winters has authority are expected to see a rise in instability.
- May 6 - With the Empire declining to take any action against Nova Imperium pending the conclusion of ACT's investigation, the League of Mandu launches military operations against Nova Imperium. Imperator Hadrian Duval calls on the Empire to honour its committments in the Treaty of Paresa and come to Nova Imperium's defence.
- May 10 - Salvation delivers another message to independent pilots via his proxy, Patience Middleton of Taurus Mining Ventures, declaring that his scientific breakthroughs will save humanity and he will provide further instructions soon. Patience Middleton notes that Taurus Mining Ventures' contract with Salvation to reward deliveries of the Hesperus logs at Hind Mine will end on May 21. The Pilots Federation again cautions commanders against cooperating with Salvation.
- May 10 - The election for Alliance prime minister is scheduled for May 27, and Edmund Mahon and Nakato Kaine resume campaigning. Alliance Tribune political correspondent Vanya Driscoll comments that Mahon's decision to postpone the election for three months to prioritise the Galactic Summit and the unsuccessful Sirius Treaty stoked significant discontent, and may have damaged Mahon's standing enough to hand victory to Kaine.
- May 11 - Media outlets warn that the conflict between the League of Mandu and Nova Imperium in Paresa could pull the Federation and Empire into a full-scale war, as the potential death of Hadrian Duval at the hands of Federal forces would demand retribution even if he is proven to be a terrorist.
- May 13 - Nova Imperium triumphs over the League of Mandu in Paresa, preventing a Federal takeover of the system. Imperator Hadrian Duval thanks supporters and declares that the incident has affirmed Nova Imperium's isolationist principles. Ambassador Catherine Carlisle of the Federal Diplomatic Corps admonishes the League of Mandu for their rash actions and announces the megaship Harmony's Shield will soon depart Imperial space.
- May 13 - The Thargoids invade ten systems: Atlas, Celaeno, Coalsack Sector KN-S b4-9, Coalsack Sector VU-O b6-6, Delphi, HIP 18390, HIP 62154, HR 1183, Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1, and Pleiades Sector HR-W d1-74. Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis surmises that Delphi was targeted in response to the recent delivery of thousands of Guardian artefacts there. Pirate King Archon Delaine of Kumo Crew also reacts with fury to news that two of his recently-built starports, California Freeport and Fort Xeno, were damaged by the Thargoids, and vows to take revenge.
- May 14 - FIA Deputy Director Bethany Blake announces that President Zachary Hudson's campaign to boost the Proactive Detection Bureau was so successful that the PDB can now scan almost every public and private comms network in Federation space. The Federal government interprets the support for the campaign as a popular mandate to continue the program. Arrest rates soar and crime rings are dismantled, but civil rights group Advocacy warns that the Federation verges on becoming a police state.
- May 17 - Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Councillor Nakato Kaine tour the Alliance to rally support for their election campaigns. On the planet Industry in Zaonce, Mahon blasts Kaine as a reactionary with no tangible accomplishments, while on New Caledonia in Alkaid, Kaine blames Mahon for the recent Thargoid attack and accuses him of prioritising funding for Aegis and Lakon Spaceways over supporting the economies of Alliance member systems. Polls indicate Mahon retains majority approval, but his support is lower than before he moved to delay the election.
- May 20 - Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Councillor Nakato Kaine announce competing initiatives to rally public support for their platforms. While the latest opinion polls predict Mahon is almost certain to win a second term in the upcoming election, his policies would still be affected if his initiative should lose to Kaine's. Mahon requests deliveries of industrial materials to Gateway to further his expansion plans and support the construction of new Alliance starports. Kaine requests deliveries of manufacturing materials to Tionisla to support Allied manufacturers and boost local trade, which would increase the supplies of rare commodities produced in Allied systems.
- May 21 - ACT announces that the evidence provided by Landgrave Arastin Delacroix that Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval and Nova Imperium are behind the NMLA's attacks cannot be authenticated, and it appears likely that Hadrian's identity was faked by the NMLA to relay orders to the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid. The vindicated Imperator thanks his supporters. In related news, Nova Imperium head of security Praetor Leo Magnus is seconded to ACT to replace the late Captain Niamh Seutonia.
- May 21 - The Aegis megaship Alexandria, laden with Guardian artefacts, jumps from Delphi to HIP 16538 to restock tritium while en route to Sol. Thargoids pursue the Alexandria and overwhelm HIP 16528, and Captain Jacob Morales issues a distress call. Admiral Aden Tanner urges pilots to come to the Alexandria's aid before its valuable research materials are lost.
- May 24 - Multiple starports recently targeted by the Thargoids report experiencing cascading systems failues that shut down their alignment thrusters, causing them to begin falling from orbit. The problem was most acute at The Oracle in Delphi, which nearly collided into Delphi 5 a. Disaster is averted by station engineers, and all affected starports are restored to stable orbits. Amid fears that the systems failures were the effect of a new Thargoid tactic rather than a coincidence, starport staff across the galaxy begin addressing this design vulnerability.
- May 24 - The Federal Navy bars the Aegis megaship Alexandria from entering Federal systems to prevent Thargoids from following it and causing more incursions. Admiral Aden Tanner announces that after HIP 16538 has been cleared of Thargoids, the Alexandria will jump to a system with a minimal population to offload its cargo Guardian artefacts.
- May 27 - As the Alliance Assembly begins voting to determine the Alliance's prime minister for the next six years, incumbent Edmund Mahon's public initiative triumphs over Councillor Nakato Kaine's, and he launches a second phase to mine tritium to fuel the construction of five new starports in the systems LHS 2522, Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19, Bei Dou Sector ZZ-Y b0, LFT 814, and Herculis Sector IW-W b1-3. Opinion polls indicate Mahon's victory in the election is assured, but challenger Kaine has created a broad base of support for herself.
- May 28 - Edmund Mahon officially wins the 3307 Alliance election after securing a plurality of votes in the Assembly, and he becomes the first Alliance prime minister to be reelected to a second term. Results from the vote were announced later than usual as some councillors demanded additional checks. Political observers comment that from the Assembly's point of view, Mahon represented stability and measured leadership in a time of ongoing galactic turmoil.

#### June 3307

- June 1 - Captain Jacob Morales outlines plans to jump the Alexandria to HIP 30944, where it will offload its cargo of Guardian artefacts and distribute it to multiple locations. As a precaution against the possibility of the Alexandria coming under Thargoid attack during or after the jump, all private ships that are docked with the megaship are asked to depart before the jump is undertaken on June 3; any ships still docked immediately prior to the jump will be jettisoned.
- June 1 - The remnant of Jupiter Division, the defeated corporatist movement formerly helmed by the incarcerated Jupiter Rochester, unexpectedly expands as Rochester's vision of replacing democracy in the Federation with corporatocracy gains popularity. Jupiter Division's megaship, Victory's Forge, reportedly rebuffed attempts by the Federal Navy to seize it in February 3307, and the faction subsequently recaptured HIP 54530 and established a presence in other systems. Despite Core Dynamics CEO Owen McKenna's vow to purge his company of Rochester's lingering influence and subjugate the rogue department, Core Dynamics employees continue to defect to Jupiter Division.
- June 3 - Prime Minister Edmund Mahon's expansion initiative receives enough support to build two new starports in LHS 2522 and Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19. Mahon comments that the new starports will benefit the Alliance's economy.
- June 3 - Core Dynamics hires Silver Legal Group to confront Jupiter Division a second time in a battle for control of Ts'ao Tach. Core Dynamics seeks to eradicate Jupiter Rochester's corporatist movement and reclaim its remaining stolen assets, while Jupiter Division attempts to prove that it and its ideology can survive without its founder. Political commentators believe this latest conflict will decide whether Jupiter Division will continue to exist.
- June 4 - The Alexandria fails to appear in HIP 30944 after jumping from HIP 16538. Admiral Aden Tanner of Aegis posits that the megaship was intercepted in hyperspace by the Thargoids. Captain Jacob Morales and his crew of four thousand are listed as missing presumed dead, and Aegis's Guardian technology research program is severely disrupted due to the loss of the Alexandria's cargo.
- June 7 - Minister Aaron Whyte announces that his Marlinism Reformation Party will provide political representation for Neo-Marlinists within the Marlinist Colonies. Whyte claims that Neo-Marlinism can be tempered into a non-violent ideology, but international observers express concern that Whyte's faction could become the NMLA's political wing. Meanwhile, the Marlinism Reformation Party loses an election in Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 to the Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah'Sine, which is seen as a rebuke of Whyte's faction for granting asylum to the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid.
- June 10 - Jupiter Division is defeated by the Silver Legal Group in Ts'ao Tach, bringing an end to the upstart faction and dealing a heavy blow to the wider corporatist movement in the Federation. CEO Owen McKenna states that Core Enterprises, a subsidiary of Core Dynamics, will absorb Jupiter Division's remaining assets.
- June 11 - Salvation contacts pilots in the vicinity of the Adamastor and the Hesperus, asking for help tracing the group of scientists who escaped the Hesperus after it was hijacked by Pharmasapien in 3113. Pilots are directed to search for a series of 17 signal beacons deployed by the Hesperus after it left the Li Chul system, then scour the area around the final beacon for signs of the expedition. This results in the discovery of the Proteus, the Hesperus's secondary exploration craft, on Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 1 a, where a series of Thargoid shipwrecks and a Guardian ruins site were also located.
- June 14 - In a report on ACT's investigation into the NMLA, Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez explains ACT is pursuing several classified lines of inquiry, but progress remains slow. The NMLA may no longer be able to carry out large-scale attacks after losing the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid's logistical support, but could be planning other forms of terrorism. ACT also confirms that it has recruited more personnel from Alliance Interpol, the Imperial Internal Security Service, the Federal Intelligence Agency, the Marlinist Constabulary, Nova Imperium's Praetorian Guard, and the Wallglass Investigations Agency.
- June 15 - Vox Galactica business analyst Marlon Royce comments on Sirius Corporation's moves to gain political influence over the past year, speculating that CEO Li Yong-Rui aspires to expand the galaxy's largest megacorporation into humanity's fourth superpower.
- June 16 - Councillor Nakato Kaine proposes overhauling the Alliance's electoral system to allow citizens to vote directly in elections for Alliance Prime Minister. The Alliance Assembly broadly dismisses the plan, interpreting it as Kaine refusing to accept the legitimacy of her recent election loss to Edmund Mahon. While some councillors do acknowledge the merits of a direct voting system, it is apparent that implementing it across all Alliance member worlds would be a formidable undertaking.
- June 17 - Sirius Corporation marketing director Sinclair Faraldo announces an initiative to mass-produce the specially-engineered Detailed Surface Scanner that was rewarded to independent pilots for participating in the Coalsack Nebula terraforming campaign in late 3306, and make it available to the public.
- June 18 - Professor Alba Tesreau comments on the discovery of the Proteus and the ancient Guardian-Thargoid War battlefield in Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2, confirming that Aegis Research advance teams have begun surveying the site, and that Aegis is preparing a megaship, the Archimedes, to support a thorough investigation. Guardian artefacts retrieved from the site may also serve to replace the stockpile lost with the disappearance of the Alexandria and allow Aegis to resume its research.
- June 21 - In the wake of Jupiter Division's fall, the Federation's corporatist movement finds itself on the brink of dissolution. A number of corporations that had joined the corporatist movement and were counting on Jupiter Division to lead it reportedly rushed to withdraw their support when it became evident that Jupiter Division would lose the Ts'ao Tach conflict. It is considered unlikely that another figurehead will emerge quickly enough to rebuild the movement into a force that could provide a viable alternative to the Republican and Liberal parties.
- June 22 - During a session of the Marlinist Parliament, Minister Aaron Whyte explains that the NMLA has reached out to the Marlinism Reformation Party and proposed a peace deal in which the terrorist group will cease its attacks and even offer reparations in exchange for permanent representation in the Imperial Senate. The proposal is condemned in strident terms by Minister Octavia Volkov, and First Minister Jenna Fairfax formally asks the Marlinism Reformation Party to halt all negotiations with the NMLA.
- June 24 - The Sirius Corporation initiative to mass-produce the Engineered Detailed Surface Scanner V1 is an overwhelming success. It is expected that it will be distributed via Technology Brokers beginning on June 25.
- June 24 - Aegis Research and Taurus Mining Ventures announce rival campaigns to collect Guardian artefacts aboard their respective megaships, the Archimedes and the Glorious Prospect, in PMD2009 48. Aegis desperately needs Guardian artefacts in order to continue its research, but Salvation, through his proxy Taurus Mining Ventures, insists that since the Proteus site was discovered using his information, he holds exclusive rights to exploit it. Aegis pledges to temporarily reduce Guardian Technology Broker module costs for all pilots should it accrue the most artefacts. If Taurus Mining Ventures succeeds instead, it will reward its supporters with an illegal double-modified Guardian Shard Cannon.
- June 25 - Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon inaugurates two new starports, Enterprise Market in LHS 2522 and Prosperity Core in Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19, that were built by his recent tritium mining project. Councillor Nakato Kaine ignites controversy when she exposes irregularities in the project: an insufficient amount of tritium had been mined to construct both starports and Sirius Corporation had apparently made up the shortfall with a series of unregistered donations. Kaine accuses Mahon of making a backroom deal. In its response, the Office of the Prime Minister states only that Sirius Corporation is one of many partners in the Alliance's expansion programme.
- June 28 - Senator Lorcan Scordato returns to the Imperial Senate from his fact-finding mission in the Marlinist Colonies and proposes that the Empire formally open diplomatic relations with the Marlinists, but encounters opposition from Senator Denton Patreus and others. The Alliance and Federation debate similar measures, and First Minister Jenna Fairfax announces that the Marlinist Colonies are planning to create a diplomatic corps.
- June 29 - The minor faction Azaladshu Free, which controls the systems Azaladshu, LFT 824, LHS 277, and LTT 3919, secedes from the Federation and becomes independent in protest against the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act and the Proactive Detection Bureau. A number of other Federal factions, all of which are located within Shadow President Felicia Winters's sphere of influence, also plan to declare their independence. Federal Congress declares Azaladshu Free's secession a violation of the Federal Accord, and the Federal Navy is placed on alert.

#### July 3307

- July 1 - Taurus Mining Ventures, working on behalf of Salvation, succeeds in its Guardian artefact collection initiative in PMD2009 48, potentially confirming its claim over Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 and disrupting Aegis's Guardian technology research programme.
- July 1 - Azaladshu Free engages the Federation-loyalist faction Neche Inc in battle in Azaladshu to secure its independence. President Zachary Hudson orders Neche Inc to defeat the secessionists, and deploys the megaship Fortress Liberty to Azaladshu to provide support. Three other Federal factions within Shadow President Felicia Winters's sphere of influence that are also considering secession, Coalition of Uteran, LP 726-6 Free, and Gluscap Labour, closely monitor the conflict; depending on the outcome, one or more could also secede.
- July 2 - A dredger belonging to the Blue Viper Club Clan arrives in Pegasi Sector PN-T c3-14, and unmarked personnel shuttles are observed travelling between the dredger and the starport Kumo City. Francesca Wolfe of the Wallglass Investigations Agency notes that this is unusual behavior for the Blue Viper Club Clan, which is known for raiding and drug running, and speculates they have business of some kind with the Kumo Crew.
- July 5 - The NMLA solidifies its ties to the Marlinism Reformation Party and endorses Minister Aaron Whyte as its political representative. Newsfeeds comment that absent any breakthroughs from ACT, the NMLA's violent methods may have succeeded in coercing the Empire to the negotiation table. Division and unrest are reported in the Marlinist Colonies as Marlinists become polarized over the NMLA using their parliament as its platform.
- July 8 - Azaladshu Free defeats Neche Inc, retaining the independence of its four systems from the Federation. The Coalition of Uteran, LP 726-6 Free, and Gluscap Labour factions also secede, taking with them another six systems under their control. Both President Zachary Hudson and Shadow President Felicia Winters are criticised by Federal Congress, the former for not containing the rebellion and the latter for possibly encouraging it.
- July 8 - Arch-Corsair Kay Volantyne of the Kumo Council opens an initiative to gather the materials to mass-produce a new recreational drug called "helix", which is believed to have originated with the Blue Viper Club and may be a new strain of onionhead. The amount of deliveries determines how widely helix will distributed to industrial markets controlled by anarchy factions.
- July 9 - The Scriveners Clan Dredger departs the Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system for an unknown destination. The gutted, unprocessed hull of the Hesperus is left in place. It is thought that the Scriveners left hurriedly either to escape the attention of tourists visiting the Hesperus or because they detected something new to salvage for their "Knowledge Core".
- July 12 - Healthcare analyst Dr Himari Grey discusses Kumo Crew's planned new drug, "helix", and the history of onionhead on Vox Galactica. The Interstellar Health Organisation acquires samples of helix to determine its composition and relationship with onionhead.
- July 13 - The Marlinist Colonies announce the formation of its foreign relations department, the Marlinist Consulate. The final step involves holding an election for the post of prime consul, which widens a rift between pro-NMLA and anti-NMLA factions. One leading candidate is Verity Dexter, a member of the Marlinism Reformation Party who vows to speak for Neo-Marlinists; she has also been promised the Imperial rank of patron by Senator Lorcan Scordato, which would finally grant Marlinists a voice in the Imperial Senate after centuries of oppression. Dexter's main opponent, Kayode Tau, opposes Neo-Marlinism and any effort to legitimize it or the NMLA, but has no Imperial backers.
- July 15 - Kumo Crew begins production of the drug helix. The Interstellar Health Organisation confirms that helix is another variant of onionhead, and mandates that it be packaged and sold as "onionhead gamma strain". Archon Delaine responds to criticism over the drug's distribution by pointing out that every system's government profits from the pharmaceutical industry, and helix will spread happiness and generate income for his people.
- July 15 - The election period for the prime consul of the Marlinist Consulate begins. Candidates Verity Dexter of the Marlinism Reformation Party and Kayode Tau of the Free Marlinist Movement request donations of data from the galactic community to support their campaigns.
- July 19 - The Far God cult returns to headlines as Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency provides an overview of the Thargoid-worshipping sect, which has grown from a fringe group to a widespread religion. Several chapters of the Far God cult begin arriving in the Panjabell system, which is ruled by a sympathetic faction called the Pleiades Concordat, but the purpose behind this gathering is unknown.
- July 20 - The IHO publishes a preliminary analysis of Onionhead Gamma Strain. While the drug is derived from alkaloid compounds found in the Onionhead flower, these compounds were modified with synthetic molecules of unknown origin that have the effect of diluting the drug's potency, enabling the plant to be cultivated in large volumes in artificial environments, and allowing the plant to survive longer in storage and below-freezing temperatures. The complexity of these modifications strongly imply that the Blue Viper Club did not make Onionhead Gamma Strain themselves.
- July 21 - The secession of ten systems and one billion people from the Federation after the victory of Azaladshu Free emboldens other Federal factions opposed to the Proactive Detection Bureau to consider breaking away. The Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act retains broad public support and the independence movement affects only a small fraction of Federal territory, but the situation is embarrassing for both President Hudson and Shadow President Winters. Civil rights group Advocacy reports that the Federal Intelligence Agency is arresting secessionist ringleaders under spurious charges.
- July 22 - Kayode Tau of the Free Marlinist Movement is elected Prime Consul of the Marlinist Consulate. Speaking in the Marlinist Parliament, Minister Aaron Whyte protests the defeat of candidate Verity Dexter and argues that electing an official who will ignore Neo-Marlinists' views will provoke more violence from the NMLA.
- July 22 - The Pleiades Concordat requests deliveries of goods to Panjabell to support the construction of up to five new megaships for the Far God cult. The cult intends to use the first megaship, the Testament, to spread its message within the Core Systems, while the other four will be sent into deep space to commune with the Far God.
- July 23 - Onionhead Gamma Strain is released on the market in systems that include Alici, Baraswar, Kishpakho, Nastrond, and Nocori. Claims that the drug is no more harmful or addictive than alcohol or coffee are largely dismissed, and it is declared illegal in all systems but those controlled by anarchy governments. Rumours swirl that Sirius Corporation is party to the deal between Kumo Crew and the Blue Viper Club, and is secretly ferrying the drug to distribution points with its own ships, but this is rejected by Sirius VP of Corporate Marketing Sinclair Faraldo.
- July 26 - FIA Deputy Director Bethany Blake confirms that the Proactive Detection Bureau is being used to gather intelligence on secessionist leaders in the Federation, who are then being arrested and charged with planning to violate the Federal Accord. President Hudson and Shadow President Winters personally attempt to calm certain system leaders within their spheres of influence and convince them to not secede.
- July 27 - Aegis is partially suspended as the superpowers launch an investigation into the disappearance of the megaship Alexandria. This comes amid a crisis in public confidence in the anti-Thargoid research organisation. Many Aegis operations are shut down, and senior members including Professor Alba Tesreau are forced to resign. Meanwhile, it is asserted by some security agencies that Salvation, whom many view as a more competent alternative to Aegis, is in fact the leader of an Aegis splinter group built by rogue agents with stolen resources.
- July 29 - The Pleiades Concordat begins outfitting three megaships, the Testament, the Perdition, and the Sacrosanct, for the Far God cult after its campaign concludes. The vessels are expected to be ready for launch on August 5.
- July 29 - The NMLA bombs Stillman Hub and Tilman Point in the Marlinist Colonies systems of HIP 22550 and Hyades Sector RO-P b6-6, likely in response to Verity Dexter's loss in the prime consul election. A broadcast from the NMLA calls the citizens of the Marlinist Colonies traitors to the cause of restoring the Republic of Achenar. Tens of thousands are killed in the bombings, and there are unconfirmed reports that First Minister Jenna Fairfax is among the fatalities. Prime Consul Kayode Tau issues an urgent request for humanitarian assistance.
- July 30 - Governor Sonal Mishra of New Kuwembaa Labour declares his faction's withdrawal from the Federal Accord, removing Kuwembaa, HIP 46179, Velniat, Navas, and Antliae Sector EG-Y d80 from Federal territory. In response, President Zachary Hudson redeploys Fortress Liberty to Kuwembaa. Three other Federal factions controlling a combined 28 systems also appear on the verge of seceding. In a sign that the Federal rebellion may be peaking, leaders of the Coalition of Uteran and Gluscap Labour factions express regret about leaving the Federation, and may consider rejoining.

#### August 3307

- August 2 - The death toll of the NMLA bombings of the Marlinist starports of Stillman Hub and Tilman Point exceeds 35,000. First Minister Jenna Fairfax is confirmed dead. Minister Amrita Ross assumes temporary leadership of the Marlinist Parliament, while the Marlinist Constabulary tightens security and moves to arrest NMLA supporters who provided logistical support for the bombings. The Alliance and Federation offer condolences and medical aid. News of the attack causes mixed reactions in the Empire.
- August 3 - The Alliance, Empire, and Federation issue formal guidelines covering the Onionhead trade in their territories following the emergence of Onionhead Gamma Strain. All variants of Onionhead remain illegal in the Federation and Empire. The Alliance allows its member systems to decide on the drug's legality individually, resulting it being outlawed in all Allied systems except those with anarchy governments.
- August 5 - President Zachary Hudson charges Li Choptep for Equality with degrading New Kuwembaa Labour's military strength and halting the spread of the Federal rebellion. The factions Selkana Labour, United HIP 108095 Values Party, Mutumu Future, Coalition of Uteran, and Gluscap Labour monitor the battle in the Kuwembaa system to decide whether to break with or rejoin the Federation.
- August 6 - The Far God cultists begin boarding their three new megaships in Panjabell: the Testament, the Perdition, and the Sacrosanct. The Testament will travel the Core Systems, while the Perdition and Sacrosanct will venture to the Witch Head Nebula and California Nebula in an effort to find the Far God.
- August 9 - The Marlinist Colonies are wracked by instability following the NMLA bombings. Fears of further bombings stoke mass panic, and known Neo-Marlinists become targets of violence from their fellow citizens. After Minister Aaron Whyte claims that the Marlinist Colonies invited the NMLA's attack by failing to elect Verity Dexter as prime consul, an infuriated Minister Octavia Volkov calls for his arrest. Some fear that the rift between Marlinists and Neo-Marlinists may continue to widen.
- August 10 - Senator Zemina Torval announces the creation of Torval-Mastopolos Mining, a new autonomous branch of the megacorporation Mastopolos Mining. This lends credibility to reports of a falling out between Torval and her cousin, Mastopolos Mining CEO Gabriella Mastopolos. Insiders claim Senator Torval was motivated by a desire to take on a more active role in Mastopolos Mining and burnish her personal legacy. It is also believed that Torval intends to establish her new business's headquarters in a permit-locked system.
- August 11 - Dr Paul Baumann, chair of the independent board of inquiry assembled to investigate Aegis, provides an outline of the investigation's scope, which involves a complete analysis of Aegis and its work, with a focus on the circumstances leading up to the Alexandria's disappearance. The inquiry divides politicians in all three superpowers; some worry that it will weaken humanity's defences, while others push for more localised anti-xeno operations.
- August 12 - New Kuwembaa Labour successfully secedes from the Federation, and is followed by Selkana Labour, United HIP 108095 Values Party, and Mutumu Future. The rebel systems sever links with the Proactive Detection Bureau. Other factions begin debating secession as the only viable path to protecting their citizens' rights from Federal government overreach.
- August 12 - The Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah'Sine declares war on the Marlinism Reformation Party, instigating a civil conflict in Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2. Minister Octavia Volkov blames Minister Aaron Whyte and his faction for the recent NMLA bombings, and calls for their arrest. Whyte flees to his private vessel and issues a call for all *"true Marlinists"* to defend his faction against Volkov's apparent violation of the Marlinist Colonies' charter. The superpowers announce they will not interfere in the conflict.
- August 13 - Growing demand for Onionhead Gamma Strain generates profits for Kumo Crew and fresh controversy. Newsfeeds in the Federation and Empire note with alarm that high-profile individuals such as CEO Zachary Rackham and Senator Simone Leatrix appear to be indulging in the drug, and warn that encouraging its use could undermine their societies. It is also reported that tourists from the Alliance and independent space have been flocking to systems where Onionhead Gamma Strain is legal.
- August 16 - Torval-Mastopolos Mining and Wreaken Construction both establish new headquarters in the permit-locked LTT 198 system after allegedly paying LTT 198 State Ltd. an exorbitant fee for permit access and construction rights on the planet Dini. It is speculated that Wreaken Construction seeks to crush its rival before it can gain a foothold. Constantia Torval, one of Senator Zemina Torval's daughters, travels to LTT 198 to take charge of Torval-Mastopolos Mining's operations.
- August 17 - The initial findings of the Aegis board of inquiry leak to newsfeeds. According to the files, Aegis was poorly managed and overly complacent. It had no strategy to reduce its reliance on independent pilots to confront the Thargoids in combat, and research into new generations of AX weapons had been sidelined to focus on attempting to communicate with the Thargoids. For their part, Aegis personnel blamed the group's inefficiency on the superpowers' funding cuts, and claimed the investigation was designed to scapegoat them. In response to the leak, Dr Paul Baumann insists that only his team's pending final report should be considered official.
- August 19 - The Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah'Sine defeats the Marlinism Reformation Party in Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2. The Marlinism Reformation Party's head, Minister Aaron Whyte, was killed in the fighting. The faction's other surviving leaders are arrested and replaced with moderates, and ACT begins investigating its ties to the NMLA's Theta Group. With the Marlinist civil war over, Acting First Minister Amrita calls a snap election to decide the Marlinist Colonies' new leader.
- August 19 - Torval-Mastopolos Mining and Wreaken Construction request deliveries of mined resources to LTT 198 to determine which faction will be permitted to remain in the system permanently. Torval-Mastopolos Mining offers to reward supporters with a modified Mining Laser should it succeed, while Wreaken Construction counters by offering a modified Abrasion Blaster.
- August 20 - Flint "Firemaker" Lafosse announces that the Engineer and conspiracy theorist Kit Fowler struck a deal to broadcast his show, "End Times", on the Rewired network. Lafosse highlights a recent episode of "End Times" in which Fowler discusses the sinister Black Flight group, which is said to have previously been active in the Neche, Wasat, and Colonia systems.
- August 23 - In an address to Federal Congress, Shadow President Felicia Winters warns that dozens of other Federal factions will secede if the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act is not repealed. This is corroborated by The Sovereign newsfeed, which claims as many as 50 Federal factions have become interested in independence after the Kuwembaa conflict. However, The Federal Times reports that some newly-independent factions are realising that by giving up Federal protection, they made themselves vulnerable to pro-Federation groups seeking retaliation and opportunistic hostile forces.
- August 24 - Dr Nisha Devi of the Interstellar Health Organisation boosts Kumo Crew's claim that Onionhead Gamma Strain has medicinal value based on initial observations of the drug's users, some of whom have exhibited relief from psychological disorders and musculoskeletal conditions. The IHO promises to publish the results of clinical trials being conducted by research facilities. Vandermeer Corporation's head of marketing, Ronan Roscoe, argues that the IHO's conclusions are flawed and all forms of Onionhead are dangerous compared to Vandermeer's own antipsychotic treatments.
- August 26 - Torval-Mastopolos Mining triumphs over Wreaken Construction in its bid to secure LTT 198 as its headquarters. Constantia Torval begins her role as Torval-Mastopolos Mining's director of operations, and the corporation announces plans to construct a new starport in LTT 198. Wreaken Construction CEO Emmerich Koenig confirms that his corporation will soon withdraw from the system.
- August 26 - Hyford's Cache in Colonia becomes active, and a decoded message identifies HIP 26176 as the location of a facility associated with Black Flight. Independent pilots investigate and find Oaken Point, as well as a trail of beacons leading to HIP 22460 and two more facilities: Fort Asch and Overlook. Logs recovered from the sites reveal the existence of Project Seraph, a 3303 initiative to develop the technology necessary for humans to pilot Thargoid ships, and indicate that Azimuth Biochemicals is behind it.
- August 27 - Octavia Volkov is elected First Minister of the Marlinist Colonies. She vows to guide the Colonies as an independent democracy with the goal of one day building a full-fledged Marlinist Republic. It is noted that Marlinist factions have regained control of all eight of their original systems and even expanded to others. In related news, the funeral of Dr Jenna Fairfax takes place, and is attended virtually by Princess Aisling Duval, which is taken as a sign that relations between Marlinists and the Empire may one day normalise.
- August 30 - Neomedical Industries announces plans to mass-produce Onionhead Gamma Strain in response to the IHO's recent report on its benefits, which supports findings from the megacorporation's own clinical trials. CEO Olwyn Kendrick explains the decision by arguing that it is inappropriate for the Kumo Crew criminal syndicate to hold a monopoly over a drug which could aid millions. The news is met with controversy in the Federation, but some independent factions express interest.
- August 31 - Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency comments on the reactivation of Hyford's Cache, spreading the word to more pilots that the HIP 26176 system contains important secrets related to Black Flight and Project Seraph.

#### September 3307

- September 1 - In response to the recent rebellions in the Federation, Imperial Senator Denton Patreus and Alliance Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran criticise President Zachary Hudson for continuing to operate the Proactive Detection Bureau. Vice President Jerome Archer again defends the PDB's record, asserting the public will grow to accept the surveillance program when they realize how effective it is in preventing terrorism.
- September 2 - Neomedical Industries requests deliveries of goods to Crippen Port, Haithis to help it mass-produce Onionhead Gamma Strain. Depending on the success of the campaign, Neomedical Industries plans to expand distribution of the drug to Alliance systems as well as more independent systems. Viewing this project as a brazen theft of commercial property, the Kumo Council deploys a megaship, The Mictlan, to Haithis, and Archon Delaine threatens to massacre the system's populace.
- September 3 - Torval-Mastopolos Mining completes the construction of its new administrative hub, the starport Torval Orbital in LTT 198, but signs of the rift between the Torval and Mastopolos families only become more evident. Mastopolos Mining CEO Gabriella Mastopolos accuses Torval-Mastopolos Mining of stealing her company's name, while Adrian and Elena Mastopolos cast doubt on Constantia Torval's ability to run a business. Nonetheless, Senator Zemina Torval's dynasty appears secure, with her other daughter Petra recently joining the Imperial Senate and her grandson Titus rising through the ranks of Imperial Intelligence.
- September 6 - Captain Milo Castile reports that ACT has arrested thousands of NMLA members and sympathisers, and learned the location of several hidden NMLA assets in multiple systems, thanks to the full cooperation of the Marlinism Reformation Party under its new moderate leader, Minister Jean-Christophe Lyon. ACT is also able to confirm that Theta Seven, who remains at large, personally directed the Marlinist starport bombings. Castile claims that with the NMLA's failure to win the prime consul election and the loss of its political wing, the terror group is more isolated than ever.
- September 7 - In an interview with the Alliance Tribune, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon reiterates that the abandoned Sirius Treaty is still viable and could swiftly restore and strengthen Aegis once it is ratified by all signatories. As Dr Paul Baumann's inquiry into Aegis continues, there are more resignations of key staff, and the organisation's financial records are audited. Dr Baumann also confirms that should sufficient evidence be obtained, certain top figures in Aegis could face charges of criminal negligence.
- September 9 - Neomedical Industries' campaign to mass-produce Onionhead Gamma Strain is a success. Enough resources are gathered to ensure the drug will be made available in 15% of all Alliance and independent systems with Industrial economies on September 17. Federal and Imperial officials criticise the move, but the Alliance notes that its trading laws are enforced on a system by system basis and Neomedical Industries has accepted liability for the deal.
- September 9 - The Kumo Council declares war on the Haithis Purple Dynamic Group over the logistics support it provided Neomedical Indsutries in the Onionhead Gamma Strain campaign. CEO Olwyn Kendrick issues a call for aid against the pirates to prevent them from intimidating investors into withdrawing, which would scuttle the drug project. Archon Delaine likewise pledges to reward pilots who assist his forces in the Haithis conflict.
- September 10 - The Empire marks the first anniversary of the NMLA bombings in Cemiess, Gabjaujis, LHS 4031, and Rabh, which killed over 60,000 people, with a day of mourning.

President Zachary Hudson, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval, and First Minister Octavia Volkov convey their condolences, and reaffirm their pledges to support ACT.
- September 13 - Seven more minor factions secede from the Federation. Although this is the largest wave of secessions yet in the ongoing Federal rebellion, none of the factions, which include Unktock Free, United Posenoi League, and the Progressive Party of Inggale, control any systems, and some see this as a sign that resistance to the PDB is eroding.
- September 14 - Salvation warns that the Thargoids will soon assault the Cornsar system based on readings from a new xeno-detection network that he is developing to supplant Eagle Eye, and urges that the local population evacuate immediately. Salvation's claim is dismissed by Carter Armstrong, a chief administrator with Aegis, and Marshal Noah Sharrow of the Allied Cornsar Constitution Party.
- September 16 - The Haithis Purple Dynamic Group fends off Kumo Council's attack, allowing Neomedical Industries to proceed with manufacturing Onionhead Gamma Strain. Neomedical Industries also reports that thanks to the defeat of Kumo Crew forces, the project has attracted more investors.
- September 16 - Thargoids strike Chadwick Port and Ito Market in the Cornsar system, vindicating Salvation. Over ten thousand people are reported dead or injured, and millions more are threatened by the presence of Thargoid ships in Cornsar. Marshal Noah Sharrow of the Allied Cornsar Constitution Party calls for aid from the galactic community, while Aegis explains that its suspension prevents it from providing any support of its own.
- September 17 - Salvation contacts pilots who previously assisted him and asks them to transport shipments of Basic Medicines from the Heart of Taurus megaship in Pegasi Sector ON-S b4-8 to either of the two Rescue Vessels in Cornsar before September 20. The shipments are deceptively registered, and contain advanced technical components that will be assembled into a prototype anti-xeno weapon capable of eliminating the Thargoid fleet in Cornsar. Salvation plans to reward participants with the permit to the Mbooni system on September 23, where they can pick up a unique modified Guardian Gauss Cannon from the Bright Sentinel megaship.
- September 17 - EG Pilots Dictator Yuri Grom and Federal Ambassador Delphine Dumont arrive in Kessler City on the planet Reagan's Legacy in Delta Pavonis to present competing proposals to gain the allegiance of the system's controlling faction, the independent Autocracy of Delta Pavonis ruled by Grand Duke Simion Petrescu. This meeting also marks the first time the Federation has diplomatically engaged with Yuri Grom, a former Federal Navy admiral who defected.
- September 20 - The Thargoids attacking Cornsar abruptly withdraw to hyperspace, and multiple crashed Thargoid vessels are reported on several local worlds. System officials and Aegis are unable to explain the development. Marshal Noah Sharrow expresses his gratitude for those pilots who helped defend the system. Meanwhile, evacuation efforts for Chadwick Port and Ito Market continue.
- September 21 - The Paresa News Network breaks the news that Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval, wife of Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval, is expecting a child in December. The media speculates that the birth of Hadrian's heir, especially a son in keeping with Imperial tradition, could upset the balance of power within the Imperial Family and grant Hadrian an opportunity to press his claim to the throne.
- September 22 - In a public broadcast, Salvation takes credit for the Thargoids' departure from Cornsar, attributing the event to his prototype anti-xeno weapon and asserting he has succeeded where Aegis has failed.
- September 23 - Saud Kruger CEO Stanislav Kruger announces a public campaign in partnership with Vistaenis Incorporated of the Vistaenis system to gather data on Earth-like Worlds in unpopulated systems to assess their suitability as future tourist destinations for Saud Kruger's subsidiary, Astrogator Tours.

- September 24 - The initially tense negotiations between the Federation and the EG Pilots over the future of Delta Pavonis make unexpected progress toward a mutually-beneficial deal in which the Autocracy of Delta Pavonis would remain independent, but maintain trade and political ties with both sides. Observers note that Ambassador Delphine Dumont and Yuri Grom developed a rapport during the conference, and speculate that the compromise deal could signal a broader intent by the two governments to finally thaw relations.
- September 27 - Vox Galactica reports on the emergence of a resistance movement against Salvation. Although Salvation succeeded in eliminating the Thargoids in Cornsar using his anti-xeno weapon, it was observed that some pilots who did not trust Salvation's motives joined with others who opposed conflict with the Thargoids and tried to sabotage the weapon by buying up and destroying shipments of its components.
- September 29 - Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency announces that he and Francesca Wolfe have made a potential breakthrough in their efforts to learn more about Jokers' Deck, a secretive gambling circle for billionaires and trillionaires that Wallglass last encountered in 3305 during their search for the missing heiress Talitha Ambrose. Gunnarson promises to reveal more in the coming days.
- September 30 - Saud Kruger CEO Stanislav Kruger declares his Earth-like Worlds data initiative a success, and confirms a 15% discount on the Dolphin, Orca, Beluga Liner, and luxury-class Passenger Cabins will go into effect from October 1 to October 8. The new Tourist Beacons to mark unique sightseeing opportunities found during the initiative will be deployed by October 28.
- September 30 - Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar ambushes the EG Union, triggering a war in Delta Pavonis. Yuri Grom claims in a broadcast that undercover Federal agents attempted to detain him and his delegation in Kessler City, but his personal guards sacrificed their lives to help him escape to the Indomitable. President Zachary Hudson issues an official statement explaining that Grom is considered a traitor and threat to Federal security, and the decision was made to eliminate him. Grand Duke Simion Petrescu of the Autocracy of Delta Pavonis denies that his faction had any involvement in the Federation's scheme.

#### October 3307

- October 1 - Senator Zemina Torval voluntarily sells half of her Mastopolos Mining shares, unexpectedly acquiescing to CEO Gabriella Mastopolos's push to remove her from her long-held position as the megacorporation's majority shareholder.

In the first phase, Brewer Corporation and the Colonia Council request resource deliveries to Jaques Station, Colonia and Macdonald Settlement, Alcor to support the construction of up to 30 stationary Flight Operations Carrier megaships that will be deployed at roughly 500 light-year intervals along the main travel route by October 28. Brewer Corporation also pledges to offer temporary discounts on Fleet Carriers and Fleet Carrier outfitting options to further incentivise participation.
- October 8 - Torval-Mastopolos Mining officially splits from Mastopolos Mining and is renamed Torval Mining Ltd. The newly independent corporation retains its headquarters, Torval Orbital in LTT 198, and also absorbs a sizeable portion of Mastopolos Mining's assets thanks to legally transferable shares. Senator Zemina Torval is named CEO, and Constantia Torval remains the operations director.
- October 12 - Erik Gunnarson receives a new transmission from Francesca Wolfe, who confirms that she escaped the clutches of Jokers' Deck momentarily, but has not yet found a way off-world.

- October 14 - The NMLA bombs Dyson City in Paresa in an attempt to assassinate Imperator Hadrian Duval and his pregnant wife, Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval. ACT and Nova Imperium intercept an NMLA transmission discussing the attack in advance, and the Duvals are evacuated to safety minutes before the bombing, but there is no time to alert other station residents. Over 15,000 people are estimated to have been killed, and a similar number injured. The Empire confirms it will provide assistance in accordance with the Treaty of Paresa.
- October 15 - The NMLA claims responsibility for the Dyson City bombing and proclaims it will *"extinguish the Duval line"*. ACT notes that Theta Seven did not appear in the NMLA's broadcast, and explains it has reason to believe that Theta Group split in two, with Theta Seven and half of his followers going into hiding after the Marlinist Colonies bombings in July, and the other half continuing the NMLA's terror campaign with this latest attack.
- October 18 - Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew of Orion University congratulates volunteers on finding The Scriveners Clan Dredger.

- October 22 - The Orion University megaship Scientia Aeterna arrives in Oochost PC-C c29-o and disables the hyperdrive of The Scriveners Clan Dredger using old override codes. Although they are trapped, the Scriveners refuse to surrender their dredger, ignoring all hails from the Scientia Aeterna and blocking boarding attempts by sealing the dredger's airlocks and electrifying its hull.
- October 25 - Senator Caspian Leopold announces the Imperial Senate's intent to take Hadrian Duval and Astrid Minerva-Duval under its protection to ensure the survival of the Duval bloodline until the NMLA is defeated. Hadrian meets with a Senate delegation to discuss terms, and it is speculated that the Senate will require that Hadrian cut ties with Nova Imperium before they accept his family.

#### November 3307

- November 1 - Civil rights organisation Advocacy comes to the defence of the Scriveners Clan in the ongoing dispute over ownership of The Scriveners Clan Dredger, invoking established interstellar laws that protect micro-societies from cultural contamination. Professor Elizabeth Perez of Orion University argues that the aging, deteriorating dredger has become too hazardous to support a population, and the university will take all necessary measures to protect the clan's members and culture during their relocation. The Scientia Aeterna halts further attempts to board the dredger, but does not withdraw its override of the dredger's hyperdrive.
- November 2 - Hadrian Duval and Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval accept the Imperial Senate's protection. Hadrian relinquishes his role as the leader of Nova Imperium and discontinues the title of Imperator. Praetor Leo Magnus receives Hadrian's endorsement to become the next leader of the organisation, which is renamed Nova Paresa. In related news, ACT signals that a breakthrough in the Dyson City bombing investigation will soon be made public.
- November 3 - Polls indicate that rebellious sentiment in the Federation provoked by the Proactive Detection Bureau is declining. Some Federal citizens rethink their opposition to the PDB after the capture of Jupiter's Wrath demonstrates communications surveillance can save lives. Whether or not the Federal rebellion continues is thought to hinge on the factions that already broke away being able to show they can prosper independently.
- November 4 - The second phase of Brewer Corporation's Colonia Bridge project begins. Assuming all quotas are met, this phase will add 26 more megaships to the route between Colonia and Alcor, linking the two Colonia Bridge segments put into place by the first phase. To attract long-range traders and explorers to the campaign, Brewer Corporation offers Class 3, 4, and 6 modified Frame Shift Drives as a bonus for the top 75% participants.
- November 5 - Admiral Aden Tanner takes command of the Aegis Defense megaship Musashi and jumps it to T Tauri, declaring that he has strong reason to believe that Hind Mine, the headquarters of Taurus Mining Ventures, contains evidence that Salvation's anti-xeno weapon is being used to deliberately provoke the Thargoids and endanger millions of people. Taurus Mining Ventures denies Tanner entry, and other Aegis leaders condemn Tanner's actions and order him to leave T Tauri.
- November 8 - FIA Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez announces that ACT has apprehended almost all members of the NMLA's Theta Group. Theta Seven, the NMLA's chief bombmaker and de facto leader, remains at large after having disappeared in July. The successful operation is attributed to ACT's interception of communications between Theta Group and Neo-Marlinist sympathisers, which was mainly possible due to Theta Group's unexplained abandonment of its dark-comms network.
- November 9 - The standoff between the Scriveners Clan and Orion University continues with no end in sight. The Canonn Interstellar Research Group offers to buy Dredger J-403 from Orion University and then gift it to the Scriveners in exchange for them making their Knowledge Core available to the public, but this proposal is considered unlikely to sway the Scriveners into giving up the fruits of two centuries of research.
- November 10 - Aanya Gupta, CEO of the Holloway Bioscience Institute, confirms that Holloway Bioscience Research Facility 15 is one of several planetary survey labs established by the institute's founder, Lord Roland Holloway.

- November 11 - Brewer Corporation provides an update on the Colonia Bridge project. Phase two receives enough deliveries to construct all 26 planned megaships for the route, and these new ports will be deployed and operational by November 25.
- November 11 - With Taurus Mining Ventures refusing to cooperate, Admiral Aden Tanner directs a military assault on the corporation's forces in T Tauri to gain access to Hind Mine and uncover Salvation's plans. Tanner continues to defy orders from Aegis leadership to leave T Tauri, and it is rumoured that many Aegis members support his actions and believe the ongoing Baumann investigation should be ended. Taurus Mining Ventures decries Tanner's actions as illegal and calls for aid from the galactic community.
- November 12 - ACT issues a request across all newsfeeds for assistance from the galactic community in cracking an encrypted message that may contain clues to the whereabouts of Theta Seven. The message was received by Theta Group on July 31, after Theta Seven had gone into hiding, and it was recovered by ACT when the cell was captured. ACT offers a reward of 750 million credits to the first person who submits a correctly deciphered version of the message.
- November 14 - CMDR Therion Cygni solves the encrypted NMLA message with the help of a series of eight false traffic data logs found in the Marlinist Colonies, and claims ACT's reward. The deciphered message indicates that its sender, most likely Theta Seven, had traveled to the Panjabell system with multiple weapons and was going into hiding. The message also confirms that the NMLA has secret benefactors, but warns Theta Group that they are no longer trustworthy.
- November 15 - The Scriveners Clan faces possible extinction as their dredger exhibits worrying signs of malfunctions in essential systems. It is thought that the dredger's inability to move and collect new resources has caused the Scriveners to run out of materials for maintenance, creating a risk of increasingly severe mechanical failures that could kill the ship's inhabitants. Alarmed, Orion Univeristy staff urgently consider ways to convince the Scriveners to back down.
- November 16 - The Pleiades Concordat and other factions in Panjabell agree to assist ACT in the ongoing search for Theta Seven. Investigators believe the NMLA leader arrived in Panjabell on July 31 and infiltrated one of the three megaships that the Far God cult launched on August 6. ACT agents attempt to warn the Perdition, Sacrosanct, and Testament, but the cultists refuse to cooperate.
- November 17 - Members of the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army, and the Marlinism Reformation Party join together to board and capture the Steel Majesty megaship in Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2. Only half of the Steel Majesty's crew is evacuated by the Marlinist Constabulary before the Neo-Marlinist fighters take operational control, trapping the remaining civilians. The coalition of Neo-Marlinists is thought to have been spurred into action by ACT closing in on Theta Seven.
- November 18 - Taurus Mining Ventures defeats the rogue Aegis Defense force in T Tauri. The Musashi is boarded and captured, and Admiral Aden Tanner is detained pending his transfer to Aegis's internal security teams. Taurus Mining Ventures allows the megaship's other crew to leave unharmed.
- November 18 - Orion University arranges a campaign in HIP 43670 to collect various types data. The data will be gifted to the Scriveners Clan in the hopes of earning their trust and gaining permission for Orion personnel to travel on Dredger J-403. Supporters of the Scriveners Clan set up a competing campaign to gather materials to repair the dredger and upgrade its systems to bypass Orion University's override codes.
- November 19 - The Steel Majesty jumps to Mudhrid and is officially reclaimed by the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, now led by Margrave Corentin Delacroix, son of the former Landgrave Arastin Delacroix. The Order warns that it will respond to any attempt to board or attack the Steel Majesty by executing the hundreds of former crewmembers. ACT states it has no solution to the hostage crisis, but the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group declares it already considers the hostages to be casualties of war and is prepared to destroy the Neo-Marlinists.
- November 19 - Rumours circulate that the planned third phase of Brewer Corporation's Colonia Bridge project, which is tentatively slated to begin in early 3308, will be revised in response to overwhelming turnout for the first two phases. More engineered Frame Shift Drives are reportedly being manufactured to be offered as rewards for phase three.
- November 22 - A spree of thefts across the galaxy are attributed to the Winking Cat. Among other artefacts and valuables reported stolen or missing from secure locations in recent weeks are a seven metre high portrait of Emperor Olban Hensard Duval painted in 2989, and the only working prototype of Achilles Corporation's XS1001 security robot. Given the rapid pace of the thefts, the Wallglass Investigations Agency theorises the Winking Cat could be a crew of criminal specialists rather than an individual.
- November 24 - Theta Seven takes control of the Far God cult megaship Sacrosanct and jumps it to Mudhrid, threatening to kill all of the vessel's passengers if any attempt is made to stop him. The Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group orders Mudhrid's security service to shoot down any ships attempting to pass between the Sacrosanct and the Steel Majesty.
- November 24 - An agreement is reached between 14 factions that control system permits to deploy so-called Gatekeeper megaships to neighbouring systems to allow permit distribution to continue regardless of local shifts in politics. A key factor in the talks is the prevention of disruption to interstellar trade. The new Gatekeeper megaships include the Shadows Endurant, Daunting Hammer, Shephard of the Mighty, The People's Vigil, Warden's Oath, The Indefatigable, Chariot of the Faithful, Varuna's Pledge, The Silver Cove, Grasp of Unity, Orchestral Falcon, and Meredith's Dream, which the join the previously deployed Peregrina Gateway and Tiliala's Lament.
- November 25 - The Scriveners Clan Dredger receives sufficient supplies to effect repairs and bypass Orion University's override codes, while Orion University's competing campaign fails to collect enough data to impress the Scriveners Clan. Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew confirms the university will honour the outcome and withdraw its claim over the dredger.
- November 25 - The Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid and Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group declare war in the Mudhrid system. The Neo-Marlinists offer an augmented Enzyme Missile Rack in an attempt to garner more support. ACT notes that the battle in Mudhrid will have a major impact on the NMLA's future, with a Neo-Marlinist victory potentially giving Theta Seven the opportunity to transfer from the Sacrosanct to the Steel Majesty and escape.
- November 26 - The 26 megaships constructed by the second phase of the Colonia Bridge project are deployed. Brewer Corporation explains the project's third and final phase will begin on January 6, 3308, and will seek to install multiple starports along the Colonia Bridge route as well as bolster the route's tritium stockpiles to address the overwhelming demand from Fleet Carriers.
- November 29 - Admiral Aden Tanner is charged with mutiny and unlawful military action by the Federal Navy over his actions in T Tauri, and will face a court-martial; if found guilty, Tanner faces a dishonourable discharge and life imprisonment. The other crewmembers of the Musashi are repatriated to their home systems to face civil or military charges. Dr Paul Baumann, chair of the independent board of inquiry into Aegis, comments that Tanner's unauthorised assault on Hind Mine, which cost many lives, will be factored into his final report.
- November 30 - Independent pilots report that the ongoing Thargoid assault in the Pleiades, Witch Head, and Coalsack Nebulas is proving unusually difficult to repel, as the Thargoids are constantly reinforcing their fleets. In light of the Cornsar incident, the Imperial Navy and Alliance Council of Admirals discuss committing their naval forces to support Salvation, and Federal Congress debates redirecting Aegis funds to the development of Salvation's anti-xeno weapon.

#### December 3307

- December 2 - The Battle of Mudhrid ends in defeat for the NMLA. An ACT commando unit is able to surreptitiously board the Steel Majesty, arm the hostage crewmembers, and retake the megaship from the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid. However, the Sacrosanct remains under the control of Theta Seven and his followers.
- December 2 - Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval gives birth to a son, Hector Mordanticus Duval. The news is celebrated throughout the Empire. Nova Paresa, now led by Praetor Leo Magnus after he resigned from ACT, organises an initiative at Dyson City, Paresa to collect delicacies to gift to Hadrian Augustus Duval, who is still sequestered with his family by the Imperial Senate.
- December 3 - The Scriveners Clan Dredger leaves Oochost PC-C c29-0 system for an unknown destination, resuming their nomadic way of life and denying the contents of their Knowledge Core to the wider galaxy. However, it is noted that without the Scientia Aeterna accompanying the dredger on its travels as Orion University had wanted, the Scriveners lack any protection or way to call for help should they encounter hostile forces.
- December 7 - Theta Seven continues to hold the Far God cultists aboard the Sacrosanct hostage in Mudhrid. ACT is unable to open negotiations, and it is too difficult for their commando unit to board the vessel as it was designed by the cultists to prevent external access. One silver lining in the standoff is that the Sacrosanct is unable to leave Mudhrid due to internal power failures. It is speculated that the cultists are sabotaging their ship to avenge the many victims of Theta Seven's Thargoid enzyme bombs, devices that the cult likely considers sacrilegious.
- December 9 - The celebration of Hector Mordanticus Duval's birth in Paresa receives an abundance of luxury gifts from the galactic community. Political commentators in the Empire take note that unless Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval or Princess Aisling Duval produce their own children, Hector is poised to one day inherit the Imperial Throne.
- December 9 - Salvation asks pilots to transport shipments of Classified Experimental Equipment from the Heart of Taurus megaship in Qarato to the Bright Sentinel in Maia, the Musashi in Delphi, and the Glorious Prospect in Merope in order to halt the Thargoid advance in the Pleiades Nebula. Salvation warns that failing to deliver sufficient quantities by December 14 will render his anti-xeno superweapons ineffective. Meanwhile, Professor Alba Tesreau quietly contacts Aegis supporters and requests that they deliver Classified Experimental Equipment to Felice Dock in Meene for Ram Tah to analyse.
- December 9 - Vodel unveils the Scorpion, a new SRV model designed for combat operations and troop support. The company holds a launch event at Levinson Orbital in its home system of Bhattra, with both chief of design Frank Endis and Core Dynamics CEO Owen McKenna in attendance.
- December 10 - The painting *Terra Absentia* by Zoe Okeke, stolen by the Winking Cat in 3305, is recovered when the Federal Intelligence Agency raids the residence of media magnate Elias Metaxas. This incident and rumours of other stolen pieces coming into the possession of the galaxy's rich and powerful suggest that the Winking Cat is selling their loot to private collectors for large sums of credits.
- December 13 - Theta Seven and his inner circle detonate the enzyme bombs aboard the Sacrosanct, killing themselves and thousands of captive Far God cultists. Theta Seven's last words, spoken in a public broadcast immediately before the explosion split the megaship in half, were *"The future will remember us."* ACT co-leader Captain Saskia Landau confirms the terrorist leader's demise, and states that ACT will turn its attention to pursuing any surviving NMLA cells and delving into the extremist group's background.
- December 14 - Salvation's anti-xeno superweapons clear almost all Thargoids from the Delphi, Maia and Merope systems, and numerous wrecks are observed on planetary surfaces, mirroring the Cornsar incident. An internal message intercepted from Salvation's allies discussing "Operation Tri-hammer" indicates that in Delphi alone, 27% of all Thargoid vessels were destroyed, and 98% of the survivors fled.
- December 15 - Salvation issues a statement to all newsfeeds confirming that his anti-xeno superweapons fired successfully in Delphi, Maia, and Merope. He declares that in 3308, he will be ready to *"deliver a decisive blow in the war against the Thargoids"*, and calls on the galactic community to support his *"crusade"*.
- December 16 - Following negotiations between the Empire and the Marlinist Consulate, the Steel Majesty jumps from Mudhrid to HIP 22550 in the Marlinist Colonies, where it is turned over to the Free Marlinists of Carinae and renamed the Fairfax Vision. First Minister Octavia Volkov announces the vessel will be repurposed for diplomatic activites.
- December 16 - Detective Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency reveals he and Francesca Wolfe received a message from the Winking Cat inviting them to participate in a *"hunt"*. Based on the message, the first half of the hunt is scheduled to take place from the 16th to the 30th of December, and the second half will run from the 23rd of December to the 6th of January.
- December 17 - Commodore Morag Halloran submits an account of her reasons for joining Salvation and Taurus Mining Ventures to the media, noting that she had been recruited alongside hundreds of other military personnel from the Alliance, Federal, Imperial, and Sirius Corporation navies. Rumours abound that to stop further defections, the superpowers are prepared officially provide support for Salvation's anti-xeno activities.
- December 17 - The Winking Cat posts the first clue in their hunt to GalNet. The clue comes in the form of a poem criticising Achilles Corporation for its greed and intrusive surveillance operations in service of *"figures too mighty to speak of aloud"*. Spelling errors in the poem point to body 5 b in the Diso system, where intrepid pilots discover that scanning a comms uplink hidden in a debris site disguised as a *"Crashed Ship"* rewards a bundle of credits and prizes.
- December 18 - The second Winking Cat poem is posted, this time describing the boundless wealth of the Imperial Family. This clue leads to another comms uplink on the planet Irvin's Wreck in Zeaex. The second gift set contains credits and an Imperial Courier stored at nearby Tryggvason Orbital.
- December 19 - The third Winking Cat poem highlights tourism company WorldCraft and derides its carefully-designed entertainment experiences as hollow compared to the real thrill of exploring the galaxy first-hand. This clue leads to a comms uplink on Major's Mine in Epsilon Eridani, and rewards a luxury Passenger Cabin module and unique Remote Release Flak Launcher with fireworks-style munitions, both of which are stored at Darkes High.
- December 20 - ACT unmasks the identity of NMLA leader Theta Seven, revealing he was a former Imperial citizen named John Tyburn from the city of Fontaine on planet Baltah'Sine in the Baltah'Sine system. Tyburn originally worked as a maker of demolitions charges for commerical mining. After becoming a pro-democracy activist, Tyburn was stripped of his job, his citizenship, and his family, and was convicted of sedition. The NMLA recruited him as a bombmaker when he was released from prison, and his skills allowed him to rise rapidly through the ranks. Eventually, Tyburn proposed weaponizing Thargoid enzymes in bombs to damage starports, leading to the NMLA commissioning a bomb design from Liz Ryder and then embarking on its campaign of starport bombings in September 3306.
- December 21 - Freelance war correspondent Ernesto Rios provides an update to Vox Galactica on the Thargoid war situation. Thargoid reinforcements continue to pour into the Coalsack, Pleiades, and Witch Head nebulae, and an anxious public demands to know why Salvation has not deployed more of his anti-xeno superweapons. Some of Salvation's supporters insist that the scientist is focusing on preparations for the the total elimination of the Thargoid threat.
- December 21 - GalNet's editorial team issues an apology for three articles that were published without official authorisation on the 17th, 18th, and 19th of December. GalNet is unable to explain how its network was breached or where the articles originated from, but assures its readers that it has taken steps to prevent further disruptions.
- December 22 - In response to fears that Alliance systems are vulnerable to Thargoid invasions, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon suggests making a strategic defence contract with Sirius Corporation. CEO Li Yong-Rui travels to Alioth at the invitation of the Alliance Assembly to discuss ways to strengthen the Alliance Defence Force. Councillor Nakato Kaine reiterates her claim that Sirius wields inappropriate levels of influence over some of her colleagues, and calls for more transparency for any deals between the Alliance and the megacorp.
- December 23 - Erik Gunnarson recaps the recent developments in the Winking Cat's treasure hunt, and notes that December 23rd marks the start of the second part and likely means three more caches will be revealed in the coming days.
- December 24 - A fourth poem from the Winking Cat appears on GalNet, this time lambasting entertainment mogul Oscar Goldsun. The corresponding uplink, located on Mitterand Hollow in Epsilon Indi, unlocks a cache of gifts funded by the theft of Goldsun's private rarities collection earlier that month.
- December 25 - The Winking Cat's fifth poem features Zachary Rackham, the billionaire owner of Rackham Capital Investments who has long been rumoured to have built his fortune through piracy. The cache that the Winking Cat prepared, likely using the credits Rackham paid to buy Picasso's *Guernica*, is found on planet 1 A in the Contien system; notably, this cache contains 100 million credits rather than the usual 10 million.
- December 26 - The sixth and final Winking Cat poem rebukes Frontline Solutions and Imogen le Ray for profiting from the galaxy's conflicts. The key to the thief's last gift, which includes a Vulture, is discovered on planet A 12 C in the Dvorsi system.
- December 27 - GalNet's editorial team issues a second apology for the disruption caused by the Winking Cat's infiltration of its network, which reoccurred on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of December. GalNet claims its technical teams have identified and blocked the method used by the thief to post messages on its channels.
- December 28 - Historian Sima Kalhana publishes the first article in a four-part series looking back on the tumultuous events of 3307. Spanning January to March, this article highlights the founding of the Marlinist Colonies, the Jupiter Division conflict, the Galactic Summit, Nine Martyrs, and the creation of ACT.
- December 29 - In the second part of Sima Kalhana's retrospective of 3307, the historian examines the events of April through June. Key moments include the establishment of the Federation's Proactive Detection Bureau, the return of the ghost ship Adamastor and hunt for its sister vessel Hesperus, the vanishing of the Aegis megaship Alexandria, Edmund Mahon's reelection as Alliance prime minister, the introduction of Salvation, and the start of a rebellion in the Federation.
- December 31 - In the fourth part of Sima Kalhana's retrospective of 3307, the historian examines the events of October through December. Key moments include the Federation's ambush of Yuri Grom, the rise of Torval Mining Ltd, the launch of the Colonia Bridge project, Hadrian Duval parting ways with Nova Paresa, Orion University's bid to claim The Scriveners Clan Dredger, the birth of Hector Mordanticus Duval, and the death of Theta Seven.

### 3308

#### January 3308

- January 1 - With the NMLA quelled, Hadrian Duval and Lady Astrid emerge from their senatorial protection to attend Princess Aisling's annual New Year gathering at her palace on Emerald, Cemiess. Their infant son Hector also makes his first public appearance, to the delight of many dignitaries present. Meanwhile, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval continues to rule from seclusion, and her absence from the public eye raises questions.
- January 2 - In the belated third segment of her retrospective of 3307, historian Sima Kalhana explores the events of July through September. Highlights include the Blue Viper Club making a deal with Kumo Crew to mass-produce the drug "helix" or onionhead gamma strain, the civil war in the Marlinist Colonies, the suspension and investigation of Aegis, the unlocking of Hyford's Cache, and Salvation's deployment of his anti-xeno superweapon in Cornsar.
- January 3 - The Alliance signs a defence pact with Sirius Corporation. The measure is approved by a slim majority in a rare, closed-door, joint session of the Alliance Assembly and Council of Admirals. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon explains that Sirius Corp will work to reinforce Alliance Defence Force vessels exclusively in anti-xeno operations, and in return the megacorp will be given priority access to certain undisclosed financial opportunities. Councillor Nakato Kaine decries the Alliance deepening ties with Sirius Corp and hiding the terms of the pact from the public by classifying them as military secrets.
- January 4 - Disregarding the risks to her career and life, ACT co-leader Captain Saskia Landau exposes a possible connection between the NMLA and Imperial Intelligence, and calls on the Senate to investigate. She explains that during her work in the Imperial Internal Security Service, she took part in a classified Imperial Intelligence project that used a communications system called Omega Grid that bears striking similarities to the NMLA's dark-comms network. The Imperial Herald receives confirmation of Omega Grid's existence from multiple IISS agents.
- January 5 - The Federal Navy Criminal Court suspends the trial of Admiral Aden Tanner to review new evidence after Tanner's defence attorney presents Ram Tah as a witness. Ram Tah testifies that the Classified Experimental Equipment used by Salvation in his anti-xeno superweapons is nearly identical to Guardian devices found at the Proteus site in Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2, and hypothesizes that Salvation scaled up a Guardian weapon design. This weapon apparently not only disrupts Thargoid bio-mechanics with electromagnetic pulses, but also provokes the Thargoids into a frenzy and causes them to mass in star systems where the weapons are present.
- January 6 - Phase three of the Colonia Bridge project begins. In this phase, Brewer Corporation asks for deliveries of supplies to be used in the construction of up to six starports that will be placed along the Alcor-Colonia route by January 27. In response to popular demand, Brewer Corporation also promises to reward the top 75% of participants with pre-Engineered Frame Shift Drives.
- January 7 - Speaking on behalf of a group of Imperial senators, Senator Karl Nerva denies that Omega Grid exists and demands that ACT be disbanded now that the NMLA is no longer a threat. Other senators call on Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval to overrule the faction standing in the way of ACT's investigation. The debate underscores the Emperor's continued absence; to allay concerns, Chancellor Anders Blaine announces that Arissa will soon return to Capitol.
- January 10 - Admiral Nikolas Glass of the Sirius Navy joins the Alliance's Council of Admirals to coordinate anti-Thargoid operations. This is the first time the Council has had seven members, and the first time the Council has seated a non-Alliance military leader. The move is endorsed by Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Fleet Admiral Hayley Sorokin, and criticised by Councillor Nakato Kaine and Admiral George Varma. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran also admits that she abstained from the January 3rd joint vote, implying the Assembly's support for the Sirius Corporation defence pact is weaker than assumed.
- January 11 - A mining contract long held by Caine-Massey to supply mined ore to various companies in the vicinity of the Dulos system expires. Torval Mining Ltd makes an official bid to claim the contract. Although an Imperial corporation making inroads on the fringes of Federal territory stirs controversy, a review from the Federal Commerce Authority finds there is no exclusivity clause in the contract to prevent the client companies involved from negotiating with a supplier other than Caine-Massey.
- January 12 - Dr Paul Baumann delivers his final report on the inquiry into Aegis. The report concludes that Aegis was hamstrung by poor mid-level management, over-reliance on independent pilots, and funding reductions. In view of the Alexandria incident and the rogue attack on Hind Mine, the report concludes that Aegis should be dismantled to prevent further deadly mishaps. In related news, Admiral Aden Tanner is found guilty in his court martial and is dishonourably discharged. At the request of Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori, the new head of the Federal Navy, Tanner's sentencing hearing is postponed while Ram Tah's findings are reviewed.
- January 13 - Brewer Corporation confirms the success of the third phase of the Colonia Bridge project. Enough resources were collected to build all six starports, which will be competed by January 27 and then gradually have services brought online.
- January 13 - Caine-Massey and Torval Mining Ltd agree to hold competing mining campaigns in the Dulos system, with the corporation that gathers the most resources to be awarded a 10-year contract with local companies in the Dulos region to exclusively supply them with raw materials.
- January 14 - Prime Minister Edmund Mahon grants Sirius Corporation permission to establish a presence in the Alliance systems of Alioth, Di Jian, Reorte, and Arimpox via the deployment of four megaships to represent Sirius Gov, the megacorporation's government division. In addition, Sirius Corp advisors officially join the Alliance Defence Force and several government departments to streamline joint operations with the Sirius Navy. Councillor Nakato Kaine argues the presence of Sirius Gov in Alliance space lacks Assembly approval and is therefore illegal. She also complains that Mahon's executive decision is protected by the terms of the defence pact and cannot be reversed by civil action.
- January 17 - The Imperial Senate continues stonewalling ACT's efforts to investigate Imperial Intelligence's possible ties to the NMLA, even as Captain Saskia Landau asserts that rogue elements with the organisation likely provided training and equipment to NMLA members. Senator Karl Nerva repeats his demand for ACT to be dissolved, but Senator Caspian Leopold sides with Landau and urges cooperation with ACT to reassure the public that Imperial Intelligence's activities are wholly above-board.
- January 18 - The Alliance, Empire, and Federation announce that per the recommendation of the Baumann Report, Aegis will be shut down. Responsibility for anti-Thargoid military operations will devolve to the Federal Navy, Imperial Navy, Alliance Defence Force, and Sirius Navy, and Aegis's xenological research will be continued by specialist departments of the Holloway Bioscience Institute, Imperial Science Academy, and Olympus Village University. While the shutdown of Aegis takes effect immediately, complete demobilisation of Aegis's personnel and assets is expected to take several more months.
- January 20 - Professor Alba Tesreau contacts Aegis supporters and asks them to investigate a sighting of a *"drifting cluster of unidentified objects"* somewhere near the Wregoe SC-X b29-2 system. Independent pilots discover the wreckage of the Alexandria strewn in the rings of planet AB 2 in Wregoe TC-X b29-0, and recover logs recorded by Captain Jacob Morales that reveal the megaship was sabotaged and its cargo of Guardian artefacts seized by operatives working for *"the Witch"*, a figure previously linked to Project Seraph and Azimuth Biochemicals. The Alexandria met its end after Morales and the surviving crew jerry-rigged the stranded vessel's hyperdrive to make an emergency jump, which carried the vessel hundreds of light years away from civilisation and tore it to pieces.
- January 20 - Caine-Massey outbids Torval Mining Ltd for the Dulos mining contract and renews it until 3318.
- January 20 - In an interview with The Imperial Herald, Princess Aisling Duval discusses the ongoing absence of Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval. The Princess makes waves by suggesting that the Emperor's life may be in jeopardy in light of Captain Saskia Landau's allegations about Imperial Intelligence and the unexplained security breach that led to the assassination of Prince Harold. Chancellor Anders Blaine responds by reiterating that the Emperor is safe and will return to public life imminently.
- January 21 - President Zachary Hudson delivers a speech to Federal Congress discussing recent and future plans to maintain security for the Federation. The Thargoids remain a top threat in 3308, but Hudson also observes that internal disputes within the Alliance and Empire may have far-reaching consequences, and he confirms his administration will soon present new policy proposals to keep the Federation safe. Shadow President Felicia Winters responds by pointing out several high-profile embarrassments for the Federation that occurred on Hudson's watch in just the last year.
- January 22 - After the media begins reporting the discovery of the Alexandria's wreckage in Wregoe TC-X b29-0, Chief Administrator Carter Armstrong publicly requests that Aegis be allowed to remain operational until the debris can be fully analysed to determine how the megaship was destroyed.
- January 24 - The Reorte Mining Coalition, the ruling faction of Reorte, blockades the Sirius Corporation megaship Chariot of Rhea and orders it to depart the system. CEO Fergus Cassidy criticises Prime Minister Edmund Mahon for not consulting local factions about inviting Sirius Corp into their systems. The Alliance Tribune comments that while many Alliance systems have embraced the Sirius Corp defence pact, those in the Old Worlds region have expressed scepticism of the megacorp's motives, and the standoff in Reorte could hinder broad acceptance of the pact.
- January 26 - The Imperial Senate shares a short personal message from Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval in which the monarch assures the public of her well-being and indirectly absolves Imperial Intelligence of the allegations that it supported the NMLA. Princess Aisling Duval comments that a mere message is insufficient to allay her concerns about Arissa's safety, and she offers to arrange and host an event for the Emperor to attend in-person.
- January 27 - The Reorte Mining Coalition attacks Sirius Corporation forces in Reorte after Sirius refuses to relocate the Chariot of Rhea. CEO Fergus Cassidy claims his faction is defending Reorte from an illegal intrusion by a foreign entity. Skirmishes break out across the system. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon orders the Reorte Mining Coalition to stand down, but Councillor Ainsley Niven, Reorte's represenative in the Assembly, claims the faction is justified in defending itself since it was not invited to ratify the Alliance-Sirius defence pact.
- January 28 - The six Ocellus starport husks built by the third phase of the Colonia Bridge project are deployed along the Alcor-Colonia route. Brewer Corporation announces that the project will be extended with a fourth phase, scheduled to start on February 10, that will complete construction of the starports and furnish them with services.
- January 31 - Based on the recovered logs of the late Captain Jacob Morales, Aegis declares that it is not at fault for the loss of the Alexandria. Chief Administrator Carter Armstrong also asserts that the common link between the Alexandria's attackers and Project Seraph, an individual known as "the Witch", strengthens the theory that Azimuth Biochemicals is still active after two centuries and continues to conduct dangerous xenological research. Armstrong requests that Aegis be reinstated immediately to counter Azimuth.

#### February 3308

- February 1 - ACT ignores the Imperial Senate's order to cease operations. Inspector Mara Klatt explains that ACT is convinced that Imperial Intelligence shared a modified version of Omega Grid software with the NMLA, allowing the terrorists to build their own dark-comms network, and Captain Saskia Landau's inside knowledge is helping ACT detect a unique identifier associated with that network. This prompts outrage from Imperial military and civil leaders, including Senator Zemina Torval, who fear ACT is compromising Imperial security, but Princess Aisling Duval proclaims her support for ACT's investigation.
- February 3 - Sirius Corporation is defeated by the Reorte Mining Coalition and begins evacuating from Reorte to Leesti. The Alliance Assembly holds emergency meetings to debate this turn of events. Councillor Ainsley Niven chastises Prime Minister Edmund Mahon for inviting Sirius Corp into the Alliance without seeking approval from its members.
- February 3 - ACT requests help from independent pilots in locating a possible Omega Grid beacon in HIP 290, and provides a partial cipher key to help decrypt any files retrieved from the beacon. ACT claims that confirming the beacon will quickly lead to more discoveries. Pilots find the beacon, leading to the discovery of three other beacons over the following days. Correspondence retrieved from the beacons reveal the existence of a group of Imperial senators called the Lords of Restoration who conspired to bankroll the NMLA and abduct Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval.
- February 4 - Secretary of State Lana Berkovich presents a proposal to Federal Congress to temporarily suspend presidential term limits so that President Zachary Hudson may remain in office beyond June 3309. Berkovich claims this is a pragmatic measure to ensure stability in the Federation as several potential internal and external crises loom on the horizon. Shadow President Felicia Winters slams the proposal as the act of a dictator, but political analysts point out that Hudson is supported by his entire Cabinet and a majority of the Republican Party.
- February 7 - The decommissioning of Aegis continues despite the organisation's exoneration over the loss of of the Alexandria. Revelations of the attack on the megaship by forces possibly related to Azimuth Biochemicals fail to convince politicians that there is a fresh need for Aegis, especially given its unsatisfactory efforts to repel the Thargoids. Many senior military figures among the superpowers change their focus to coordinating with Salvation, and channels of secondment are opened to allow naval crews to serve on Salvation's vessels without resigning. In related news, a public ceremony is planned to posthumously award medals of honour to the late Captain Jacob Morales and the Alexandria's crew.
- February 8 - Prime Minister Edmund Mahon gives Li Yong-Rui his personal guarantee that the Reorte incident will not be repeated elsewhere in the Alliance and notes that Sirius Corporation was welcomed in Alioth, Arimpox, and Di Jian. However, the conflict in Reorte causes more Councillors to side with Nakato Kaine and question the wisdom of a strategic defence pact.
- February 9 - Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval is rescued by the Imperial Guard after it engages Darkwater Inc troops in Summerland and intercepts a fleeing ship. The monarch is freed from a cryogenic pod, returned to Capitol, and given medical attention at the Imperial Palace. The Imperial Internal Security Service opens an investigation into the Lords of Restoration conspiracy based on ACT's recent findings, and senators Alberto Gereon, Karl Nerva, and Ursula Torquatus are arrested alongside several other conspirators within Darkwater Inc and Imperial Intelligence.
- February 10 - Brewer Corporation launches the fourth phase of the Colonia Bridge project, but with some changes to the previous format: instead of a single week-long initiative, this phase is broken into four initiatives that will take place over the next four weeks and offer different rewards. For the first week, pilots are asked to deliver commodities to install Universal Cartographics and Vista Genomics services aboard the six Colonia Bridge starports in exchange for generous sums of credits.
- February 11 - Thargoid attacks are reported in Dan, HIP 12314, and Nauni on the fringe of the Core Systems. Some believe this latest wave of incursions to be retaliation for Salvation's activation of anti-xeno superweapons in Delphi, Maia, and Merope in December 3307. With the superpowers still in the process of organising their new anti-xeno taskforces, a number of Aegis support megaships that have not yet been decommissioned are hastily rushed back into service.
- February 14 - ACT releases a report on the Lords of Restoration. Led by Senators Gereon, Jourdain, Nerva, Scordato, and Torquatus, the conspiracy's goal was to abolish the position of Emperor and transfer executive power to the Senate. The Lords intended to use the NMLA to assassinate the Duvals and manipulate the Imperial populace into accepting senatorial rule as an alternative to the *"threat"* of Marlinist democracy. As part of this plan, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval was kidnapped in January 3307 while she was being transported to a secure location, and Nerva and the Lords' agents in Imperial Intelligence fooled the Senate into thinking Arissa was safe by using a virtual representation of the Emperor to fabricate messages. ACT states that it is working closely with Imperial security agencies to identify the Lords' remaining collaborators.
- February 15 - The Hudson Contravention, President Zachary Hudson's proposal to remove the limit on his term in office by repealing the 77th amendment of the Federal Accord, generates significant controversy in the Federation. While it is backed by Hudson's Cabinet and other leading Republicans, former presidents Jasmina Halsey and Antonia Madison condemn the proposal as unconstitutional and authoritarian. Shadow President Felicia Winters is expected to call for a vote of no confidence, and analysts believe Hudson is unlikely to survive such a vote.
- February 16 - Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval marks her return to Capitol with a public ceremony in Trasken Square attended by millions of citizens. The Emperor thanks her loyal supporters and declares she will punish everyone involved in the Lords of Restoration plot. Official statements from the Imperial Palace also recognise the efforts of Princess Aisling Duval, ACT, and independent pilots in helping to free Arissa and destroy the NMLA.
- February 17 - Colonia Bridge phase four enters its second week. This initiative requests commodities in order to install Pioneer Supplies, Crew Lounge, and Search and Rescue services in the six Colonia Bridge starports.
- February 17 - The Empire declares Darkwater Inc a hostile military target for its role in Emperor Arissa's abduction. Reports indicate the PMC's leader, Colonel Ronan Brock, attempted an unsuccessful takeover of the Summerland system as a defensive measure after ACT exposed the Lords of Restoration, and as a result, all Darkwater contractors have been branded criminals by system authorities. The Empire arranges for Summerland's permit restrictions to be lifted for three weeks so independent pilots can assist in Darkwater Inc's total eradication.
- February 18 - Independent pilots spearhead anti-Thargoid efforts in Dan, HIP 12314, and Nauni. The superpowers' anti-xeno taskforces remain works in progress, and journalist Flint "Firemaker" Lafosse opines that the superpowers are so mired in internal crises at the moment that their real plan is to leave the Thargoid problem entirely to Salvation and his anti-xeno superweapon.
- February 21 - ACT releases additional information gleaned from Omega Grid about a plot by the Lords of Restoration to frame Hadrian Augustus Duval as the leader of the NMLA in April 3307, which involved using a virtual doppelganger of Hadrian to send orders to NMLA allies such as Landgrave Arastin Delacroix. Devised by Senator Ursula Torquatus, the plan's purpose was to weaken public trust in the Imperial Family, but it largely failed. Months later, the Lords had the NMLA attack Paresa in an attempt to kill Hadrian and Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval before their son Hector could be born, but other senators then moved Hadrian's family out of reach. ACT's findings clear the names of Hadrian and Lady Astrid.
- February 22 - Shadow President Felicia Winters leads protests across the Federation against the Hudson Contravention as Federal Congress debates the proposal. The Federal Times points out that moderate Republican voters are wary of President Zachary Hudson's attempt to repeal the 77th amendment to the Federal Accord because it would deny them the chance to support other rising Republican leaders for the presidency, including Vice President Jerome Archer, Secretary of State Lana Berkovich, and Grand Attorney Edwin Espinosa.
- February 24 - The Empire's reprisal operation against Darkwater Inc concludes. Colonel Ronan Brock is killed by Imperial auxiliaries when he attempts to flee the megaship Onyx Storm. Darkwater's elimination also means the end of any further large-scale NMLA threat. The Empire establishes a new faction, The Praetorian Vigil, in Summerland that will report directly to the Emperor.
- February 24 - Colonia Bridge phase four enters its third week. The previous week's initiative was mostly successful, but commodity shortages in the Colonia Region mean one of the six Colonia Bridge starports, Promium Relay in Eoch Flyuae QK-E d12-2118, will not receive Pioneer Supplies, Crew Lounge, or Search and Rescue services. The week three initiative requests commodities in order to install Material Trader, Bartender, and Mission services in the starports.
- February 25 - Councillor Nakato Kaine motions to censure Prime Minister Edmund Mahon over the Reorte debacle, which the Alliance Assembly approves by a plurality. Following the vote, Kaine delivers a speech calling for the Alliance's strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation to be reclassified as civil legislation rather than a military contract, and she also demands that Li Yong-Rui accept these terms or withdraw Sirius forces from Alioth, Arimpox, Di Jian, and Leesti.

#### March 3308

- March 2 - The remainder of Aegis's leadership council formally submits an appeal to reinstate the organisation so that it can counter both the Thargoids and Azimuth Biochemicals. Chief Administrator Carter Armstrong makes the case that the superpowers are too distracted by internal politics to effectively defend against the Thargoids with their separate anti-xeno taskforces or bring Azimuth to justice for the Alexandria tragedy, while a reconstituted Aegis could give both threats its full attention.
- March 3 - The third week of Colonia Bridge phase four successfully implements Bartender and Material Trader services for the six starports, but the quota for Mission Boards is not met. The final Colonia Bridge initiative requests one last wave of deliveries to install Outfitting, Shipyard, and Technology Broker services. The initiative also presents a second opportunity to install Pioneer Supplies on Promium Relay. Participants are offered pre-Engineered Power Plants and unique ship decals as a reward.
- March 4 - To assuage concerns about the Hudson Contravention, President Zachary Hudson delivers a speech from the White House on Mars. The president explains that the temporary suspension of the 77th amendment to the Federal Accord will simply allow him to run for another term in the 3309 presidential election, not hold office indefinitely. Federal citizens would still be free to vote for other Republican, Liberal, and third party candidates, and Hudson would not be guaranteed to win. Hudson also calls for his and Felicia Winters's supporters to refrain from further violence after clashes are reported at public demonstrations on many Federal worlds.
- March 7 - Its mission complete, ACT is officially disbanded, though the Cornelius-Lasky Convention keeps the door open for the organisation to be reactivated should another threat on par with the NMLA appear in the future. Captain Milo Castile, Inspector Mara Klatt, Praetor Leo Magnus, and Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez are commended for their work. For her key role in exposing the Lords of Restoration, Captain Saskia Landau is awarded the Achenar Service Cross by Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval and given command of Imperial Intelligence.
- March 9 - The Alliance and Sirius Corporation negotiate a three-month probationary period for their strategic defence pact. Proposed by Li Yong-Rui to smooth over tensions caused by the Reorte incident, this trial is intended to allow Sirius to demonstrate how it can help the Alliance protect itself from Thargoid attacks, and when it concludes, the Alliance Assembly can decide whether or not to continue the partnership. Councillor Ainsley Niven warns that even this concession may not be enough to persuade some Alliance systems to cooperate with Sirius.
- March 10 - The Colonia Bridge project comes to a triumphant conclusion as services are added to its six starports. Brewer Corporation CEO Madelyn Teague releases a personal message of thanks to the pilots who made the project possible, and reiterates that the names of the most dedicated contributors will be recorded in beacons placed in the Colonia and Alcor systems.
- March 11 - On Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's orders, cohorts of the Imperial Guard are assigned to Princess Aisling Duval, Archduke Otto Lombardo-Duval, Lucretia Roche-Duval, Admiral Lucius Lavigny, and Countess Guinevere Lavigny. The measure is taken to ensure the survival of the Duval dynasty in the wake of the NMLA's assassination of multiple Duvals and Lavignys. Hadrian Duval declines the Emperor's offer, explaining that he trusts his personal Praetorian Guard to provide security for himself and his son.
- March 14 - The Reorte Mining Coalition threatens to withdraw Reorte from the Alliance in protest of the Alliance-Sirius strategic defence pact. CEO Fergus Cassidy accuses Sirius Corporation of arranging the pact's probationary period solely to give itself time to pressure Alliance officials into assenting to the pact. Councillor Ainsley Niven reports that the Reorte Mining Coalition considers leaving the Alliance less of a risk than allowing Sirius Corp a foothold in Reorte. This development undermines the pact and prompts speculation that other Alliance members may seek independence.
- March 17 - Federal authorities requested help in hunting down a pirate gang in the Gliese 868 system. The controlling faction Gliese 868 Services released a statement saying that recent Federal security services have been focused on dealing with political protests and this focus allowed criminals to cause havoc through raiding trade convoys and acts of piracy throughout the region. They announce that they have initiated a campaign using Congressional funding to destroy all wanted vessels within the Gliese 868 system. Independent pilots are asked to help the authorities eliminate the criminal thread. Gliese 868 Secretary of State Lana Berkovich stated to the press that the Hudson Contravention had generated a lot of high-running feelings on both sides, but regrettably the Gliese 868 Congress must make an example of the pirates to deter criminality. The pirate hunting campaign is expected to run through 24th March 3308.
- March 18 - The megaship Trobairitz arrived in the Reorte system to support the efforts of the Reorte Pro-Alliance League. After the recent expulsion of the Sirius Corporation from Reorte and refusal to accept the strategic defense pact, there have been proposals by the controlling faction to renounce its membership in the Alliance and declare independence. These proposals have catalyzed others to campaign for Reorte to instead remain in the Alliance.  Louisa Leblanc, chief administrator of the Reorte Pro-Alliance League, said in an interview to the Alliance Tribune that the proposed partnership with Sirius Corporation is restricted to increasing defenses against the Thargoids and that this will not be disruptive enough to justify losing the Alliance membership benefits they currently enjoy. The Reorte Pro-Alliance League announced they are supported by the Alioth Independents faction and that the Trobairitz megaship had been supplied to them, serving as their center of campaign operations. Sirius Corporation's official statement was that this situation is an internal matter for the Alliance, though the Sirius delegates have been briefed on the situation.
- March 21 - Various Imperial allies, ambassadors, and nobles were summoned to Capitol for a series of meetings with Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval. The event was meant to reassure the citizens of the Emperor's physical presence and court ceremonies were held to reaffirm the loyalty of all attendees to Emperor Arissa with as much spectacle and grandeur as possible. Outside of the public eye, Arissa's closed sessions with the Imperial Diplomatic Corps briefed the Emperor on recent developments. One notable attendee was Prime Consul Kayode Tau of the Marlinist Consulate, of the Marlinist Colonies.
- March 23 - The megaships Musashi and Heart of Taurus entered the Synuefe CE-R c21-6 system to perform a mining-related research operation. Taurus Mining Ventures, an independent mning corporation closely associated with Salvation, has acted as his intermediary in recent months and directly supporting his efforts to combat the Thargoids. Head of Research for Taurus, Dr Ruben Carpenter, provided a statement saying that Taurus has recorded some unuual radioactive signatures in the Synuefe CE-R c21-6 system, transforming their understanding of molecular structures of certain naturally occurring substances. Carpenter announced further that their obective was to perform detailed analyses of the irradiated materials to determine their value as mineable resources.
- March 24 - The situation in Reorte deteroriates further as pro-independence factions clash with pro-Alliance factions, with rival initiatives in place to decide Reorte's future affiliation. The system's controlling faction wishes to declare independence for Reorte in protest of Sirius Corporation's proposed anti-xeno defense pact with the Alliance Defense Force. Reorte Mining Coalition's CEO Fergus Cassidy gave a statement criticizing Alliance Prime Minister Mahon for working with Sirius, and calls for independent pilots to deliver shipments of advanced medicines, skimmer components, and building fabricators to Davies High starport in support of their independence ambitions. Rival faction Reorte Pro-Alliance League also gave a statement promoting the danger and instability of severing ties with the Alliance and called for deliveries of the same components to their megaship Trobairitz.
- March 25 - The Gliese 868 pirate hunting operation comes to a conclusion. The Federation Navy auxiliaries worked with independent pilots to drive the pirates back. The Federal Times reported the repercussions of this operation, publishing that the security agencies of the system were embarassed to have to rely on amateur volunteers to protect trade in Gliese 868, leading for fresh demands that President Hudson's proposal to repeal the 77th amendment must be negotiated peacefully without causing civil disturbance.
- March 28 - Taurus Mining Ventures announces details for their new mining initiative in the Synuefer CE-R c21-6 system. Ruben Carpenter, head of the TMV Research Division, provided an update saying the source of radiation in the system has not yet been identified. Current theories are that naturally occurring ores in the systems may have altered properties but if correct, the ore may have a high commercial value after being processed into usable metals and materials. Commodore Morag Halloran issued a statement reiterating the need for maintaining positive relations with independent pilots and therefore, Taurus will subcontract the upcoming mining operation to the Pilots' Federation.
- March 29 - Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval announced plans for reconnecting the Marlinist Colonies to the Empire. Prime Consul Kayode Tau reported the idea is to grant Imperial protectorate status to the Marlinist Colonies in exchange for swearing allegiance to the Empire. Details include local government autonomy, Imperial Navy and security agency presences, trade investment with Empire-based companies, and new channels of transportation and communication being opened. The Marlinist Parliament has received the proposal details and is preparing a response.
- March 31 - The Reorte system remains with the Alliance with Reorte Pro-Alliance League's success over the Reorte Mining Coalition. Independent pilots were able to help persuade Reorte citizens that Reorte's future was more secure with the Alliance through deliveries of advanced medicines, skimmer components, and building fabricators in large quantities. Chief Administrator Louisa Leblanc celebrated the victory and thanked those who supported their goals.
- March 31 - Taurus Mining Ventures requests help with their mining and delivery operation in Synuefe CE-R c21-6. According to Dr Ruben Carpenter, head of the company's R&D division, the initiative calls for the mining and delivery of coltan, lithium hydroxide, and methanol monohydrate crystals from sources within the system. The purpose of this initiative is to help analyze differences between materials from this system and materials from other systems to determine differences.

#### April 3308

- April 1 - The Federal Congress temporarily postponed making a decision on whether to extend presidential term limits. President Zachary Hudson had proposed to repeal the 77th amendment of the Federal Accord which imposes a term limit of eight years maximum. Hudson delivered a statement saying he agreed that more time is needed to analyze the repercussions of the amendment and that a congressional subcommittee would perform an inquiry to investigate. The decision was welcomed by Shadow President Winters.
- April 5 - The Marlinist Colonies will vote to accept or decline the offer to become an Imperial protectorate. The Marlin Standard summarized the situation by posing the societal question of whether the Colonies should remain an isolated republican society or to move beneath the Empire's protective wing. The Standard notes the anger of colonists about the Emperor's request, citing the hunt of NMLA and persecution of Marlinist believers. First Minister Octavia Volkov put the issue to referendum.
- April 7 - The Taurus Mining Venture initiative in Synuefe CE-R c21-6 concludes successfully. Dr. Ruben Carpenter announced that TMV had sufficiently large quantities of coltan, lithium hydroxide, and methanol monohydrate crystals had been to delivered to aid in the ongoing research. Taurus also confirmed that studies to identify the source, effects, and application of this radiation are ongoing, though scientific journal The Empirical has reiterated that these *"atypical radioactive signatures"* have not been independently verified.
- April 8 - The public referendum in the Marlinist Colonies has resulted in the majority voting to remain fully independent from the Empire. First Minister Octavia Volkox announced the referendum's result in the Marlinist Parliament, claiming a clear popular mandate for independence and a rejection of monarchy in favor of republican governance and representation. The First Minister thanked the Emperor and called upon her to recognize and respect the decision of the Marlinist Colonies.
- April 12 - Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval formally recognized the results of the Marlinist Colonies referendum and released a statement citing uncomfort with democracy in the Colonies, but acknowledged that the population had spoken. The Emperor then stated that there was a condition to the Emperor's acceptance of the referendum and that the Marlinist Constabulary must work with the Empire's intelligence agencies to prevent any resurfance of the NMLA or similar terrorist groups. The Imperial Intelligence agency and the Marlinists would collaborate on identifying Neo-Marlinist extremists, to which the Colonies agreed. To recognize the minority who wished to rejoin the Empire, customs and citizenship arrangements are being worked on.
- April 13 - Sirius megaships arrive in the Coalsack and Witch Head Nebulas to provide anti-xeno support as a demonstration of Sirius Corporation's military capabilities.

- April 15 - Multi-billionaire Zachary Rackham discussed running for Federal president as an independent candidate in the 3309 elections. During the opening of a new superstructure named Rackham's Spire on Homeland, in the Beta Hydri system, Rackham was asked for his views on the Hudson Contravention. He hinted at running for office himself, prompting financial journalist Bryanna Blanco to write an opinion piece for The Federal Times. In this article she writes about spending half her career investigating Rackham and is unconvinced that he has pure motives, citing Rackham's former identity as Calico Zack, one of the last century's most notorious pirates, and accusing the media of ignoring his true character.
- April 18 - The anonymous anti-xeno scientist Salvation has received further military support from the Alliance, Empire, and Federation. Official sources highlighted the increasing number of crew members from the Alliance Defense Force, Federal Navy, and the Imperial Navy choosing to temporarily serve on vessels owned by Salvation's commercial partner Taurus Mining Ventures. Salvation also received support in intelligence, logistics, security, and anti-xeno weaponry expertise. Scientific research journal The Empirical reported that no evidence of atypical radiation has been detected in the Synuefe CE-R C21-6 system, raising questions as to the purpose of Taurus Mining Venture's recent mining operations in that system.
- April 19 - CEO Li Yong-Rui of Sirius Corporation addressed public concerns regarding its anti-xeno defense pact with the Alliance. Yong-Rui defended the decision, citing the past millennium of history and Sirius's involvement on the political stage.
- April 21 - Construction of new Marlinist starports have begun after materials were delivered to the HIP 22550 system. Two orbital stations are under construction and expected to become operation by May 5th, 3308. First Minister Octavia Volkov marked the campaign's conclusion in a statement thanking independent pilots for their work and expressed her goals for the future of the Free Marlinists of Carinae. Prime Consul Kayode Tau has been invited to establis an office of the Marlinist Consulate on Capitol, a sign of increased diplomatic tolerance from the Emperor.
- April 21 - Thargoid fleets invaded the Didio, Novas, and Sosong systems, putting more than ten billion lives at risk. Local security services in all three systems reported overwhelming numbers of hostile Thargoid vessels. Several starports were directly attacked with caustic enzyme weapons and the combined death toll is already in the thousands. Didio, Novas and Sosong are members of the Alliance, Empire, and Federation respectively. It will be days before the superpowers could muster a response, and therefore emergency calls for assistance to all independent pilots have been made by the factions Emperor's Grace, LTT 4772 Alliance Mandate, and Union of Sosong Democrats. With Aegis's official disbandment, its fleet is being temporarily operated by Frontline Solutions. The combat logistics corporation made the ships available with a volunteer pilot force which will support the superpowers in systems invaded by Thargoid fleets. The Alliance, Empire, and Federation are currently liasing with Salvation, whose unique weaponry proved effective against Thargoid incursions of similar magnitude.
- April 22 - Zachary Rackham consolidates his commercial and political headquarters in the Beta Hydri system. Rackham's business owns a majority of shares in the Beta Hydri Corporation, the system's controlling faction. Rackham has already been governing the system for some months. Questions are raised if Rackham's political position in Beta Hydri paved the way for running as an independent candidate in 3309's presidential election. The Federal Times covered the story, with journalist Bryanna Blanco stating that Rackham's citizenship documents have never been made public or independent verified, and called into question whether "Calico Zack" was even born in the Federation to begin with.
- April 25 - Sirius Corporation vows to defend the Alliance, citing the recent Thargoid attacks in the Didio, Novas, and Sosong systems.
- April 26 - Archon Delaine announced that pirate leader Callan Salamanca is the newest member of the Kumo Council's upper echelon.

The Alliance Defense Fleet is fighting the Thargoids in Didio under the command of Admiral Rachel Ziegler. Admiral Nikolas Glass, liaison between Sirius and the Alliance Defense Force, gave details of the campaign. The campaign called for large quantites of basic medicines, evacuation shelters, and food cartridges to be delivered to the megaship Chariot of Rhea in the Leesti system, where they were delivered to Didio in military convoys. Sirius was criticized for not providing similar support to Novas and Sosong systems, also invaded by Thargoids, but Sirius responded that the corporation has no obligation to those systems without an agreement with their superpowers.
- April 28 - The Alliance, Empire, and Federation offer bounties on Thargoid vessels in the Didio, Novas, and Sosong systems. Commodore Morag Halloran, coordinator of Salvation's military forces, broadcast a message on public channels stating that Salvation has started construction of three anti-xeno superweapons to fight the Thargoids with and estimated that they would be operational in two weeks' time. Until that time, it was vital that the Thargoids be kept at bay. Independent pilots were asked to buy time for the superweapons to be completed by killing as many Thargoid vessels as possible until May 12, 3308. Each superpower also deployed a capital ship to the invaded systems: Alliance megaship Salote Charm in Didio, the Majestic-class interdictor INV Succession in Nobas, and the Farragut-class battle cruiser FNS Amphion in Sosong.

#### May 3308

- May 1 - Jade Sanderlyn of Vox Galactica conducts interviews with admirals of the three superpowers.
- May 2 - The Imperial Senate argues that the Marlinist Colonies should have become an Imperial protectorate to shield them against the Thargoids. Senator Arturo Durant said to The Imperial Herald that the Marlinists would regret the decision to reject Imperial protection, but it is still the duty of the Empire to defend them whether or not they grant permission to do so. First Minister Octavia Volkov replied to this statement saying that the protection was not necessary and reminded the senator that they not only retained control of their original colonies but have also expanded into over two dozen neighboring systems, fulfilling Marlin Duval's dream of forming an interstellar republic after centuries of being repressed within the Empire.
- May 4 - Zachary Rackham is interviewed by Sol Today about his business empire, role with the Beta Hydri Corporation, his poltiical ambitions, and the claims that he was once a pirate. Rackham waved off the pirate allegations.

Salvation's anti-xeno superweapons are expected to be operational one week from today.
- May 5 - Independent pilots were asked to collect meta-alloys as part of a wider xenological study of the Thargoids. Orchestrated by Professor Ishmael Palin, the research project's goal is to learn as much as possible about Thargoid biomechanical nature for the purpose of enhancing humanity's defenses against it. The initial phase requires fresh meta-alloys to be delivered to the James Sneddon starport in the Morten-Marte system, which also offered increased prices for any Thargoid tissue samples. Palin suggested that pilots take advantage of corrosion resistant cargo racks at the starport for the upcoming second phase of the research project over the next few weeks.
- May 6 - Two new starports were added to Marlinist systems following a successful delivery initiative in April. The use of prebuilt infrastructures and mass-produced components allowed the orbital stations to be assembled rapidly. The starport names and locations are Fairfax Legacy in the Hyades Sector SU-C a14-1 system and Ackwada Monument in the Hyades SDector LX-T c3-30 system. The recent diplomatic arrangement that repatriated two million Marlinist refugees are being processed and granted citizenship at the new starports.

Archon Delaine broadcast a message vowing to crush Trask and promises to pay well to wipe out every traitor who supports him. The Kumo Council faction subsequently announced that they will reward all independent pilots who support its operation against the Trask Death Corsairs in the HIP 10792 system.
- May 20 - Dredger clan continues to examine the abandoned generation ship Golconda in Upaniklis. The Golconda was placed in orbit around Upaniklis B 3 in 3305 when its inhabitants migrated to the nearby outpost of Forester's Choice. Over the past week there were reports of smaller craft traveling between the Artificers Clan dreder and the Golconda, but the nomadic tribe has not responded to communication attempts. The Federal Diplomatic Corp published an official reminder that Forester's Choice has partner status with the Federation and added that the Golcondan people are legally protected against cultural contamination as a micro-society that evolved in isolation.
- May 23 - Salvation releases a statement following his latest success against the Thargoids. The statement announces that the deployment of the anti-xeno superweapons was highly effective and billions of lives were saved.

Salvation predicted the end of the war was finally within reach. Commodore Morag Halloran confirmed that Taurus Mining ventures had received a boost in resources from all three superpowers, including seconded naval personnel, megaship supplies, and advanced engineering equipment. The superpower militaries openly stated they are now fully committed to working with Salvation on anti-xeno operations.
- May 24 - The Blue Viper Club dredger clan unexpectedly severed ties with the Kumo Crew, who is already battling an attempted rebellion. No explanations or itinerary were provided when the nomadic tribe's dredger jumped from the Pegasi Sector PN-T c3-14 system to an unknown destination. The Blue Viper Club was most known for providing a new narcotic crop that later became known as onionhead gamma strain.
- May 26 - The Kumo Crew decisively crushes the rebellion in the HIP 10792 system. Vidar Trask, formerly an arch-corsair in the Kumo Crew syndicate, was declared dead when his private vessel was destroyed during the conflict. The few surviving ships in the Trasl Death Corsairs abanded his cause. Further details of the insurrection came to light, revealing that Trask secretly gathered followers while acting as Archon Delaine's trusted advisor. Trask's funding came from gambling at Joker's Deck events, which he used to buy independent criminal groups to bolster his forces, answering the mystery of where half of the rebel fighters came from. It was also confirmed that Trask's previously unidentified mercenaries were members of the Blue Viper Club dredger clan, suggesting that his partner in the coup attempt was indeed Arch-Corsair Kay Volantyne who originally hailed from the nomadic tribe. She was last seen returning to her dredger before it jumped to an unknown destination. Archon Delaine proclaimed his intent to hunt down and kill every one of Volantyne's clan for their betrayal.
- May 26 - The Artificers Clan began retrofitting the generation ship Golconda into a fully operational modern vessel. Former captain Jonathon Forester provided a statement saying that they were worried the Artificers had come to salvage the vessel, but instead they started doing engineering work on it.

They did this without permission but now the question for the Golcondans is to whether they should return to their old home and become nomadic once more, or to remain on the outpost.
- May 27 - Trillionaire entrepreneur Zachary Rackham announced his candidacy for presidency in the 3309 Federal election.
- May 30 - Professor Alba Tesreau, former head of research at Aegis, announced the discovery of an abandoned outpost in the DG Canum Venaticorum system after being directed there by a source with the question: *"Who is Salvation?"* Independent pilots verified the claim and it was confirmed that a previously undiscovered research outpost once controlled by the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm had been found there. The site contained logs that directly connected Azimuth Biochemicals to INRA's development of the mycoid virus. Professor Tesreau added that most significantly, she believed that the logs would reveal Salvation's real name and background, and she urged the superpowers to halt collaboration with Salvation while the new data was verified.
- May 31 - The generation ship Golconda continues being repaired by the Artificer Clan. While repairs continue, Golcondans also continued debating about their future and whether to re-board the Golconda to become space nomads once more.

#### June 3308

- June 1 - More information about Vidar Trask's failed coup emerged as reported by The Pegasi Sentinel. The Sentinel reported that over one thousand fighters were supplied by the Blue Viper Club, proving the involvement of Kay Volantyne in the coup alongside Trask.
- June 2 - Independent pilots were asked to assist the Golconda in the Upaniklis system as it resumes its voyage. The generation ship was retrofitted and the majority of its former population have decided to leave the outpost Forester's Choice and return to their traditional nomadic lifestyle. Captain Jonathon Forester, leader of the Golconda Union, announced that the Golconda has a frame shift drive that needs tritium, along with also needing medical diagnostic equipment and power generators. Pilots were requested to deliver these materials to Fozard Port, where they were transferred to the Golconda.
- June 3 - A public outcry followed claims that Salvation was once a senior member of Azimuth Biochemical who worked for INRA. Information came to light by Professor Alba Tesreau from the DG Canum Venaticorum system suggesting that Salvation's real name is Dr Caleb Wycherly, former vice-president of research at Azimuth Biochemicals. His team contributed to the development of the mycoid bioweapon deployed by INRA during the First Thargoid War. It was also revealed that he gained the nickname of "The Witch", a figure which had also been implicated in the attack on the Alexandria megaship in June 3307 and in Project Seraph recordings found in the HIP 26176 and HIP 22460 systems. Demands for Salvation's arrest and questioning over his involvement in these events have been made by former Aegis leadership. Salvation's supporters dismissed the logs as fake, citing that Wycherly would now be over 200 years old and that the mention of salvation was merely coincidental.
- June 8 - The probationary peiod for the anti-xeno partnership between the Alliance and Sirius Corporation ended. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon released a statement announcing that the decision would be submitted for debate and voting by the end of June.

- June 9 - The Golconda generation ship was able to resume its millennia-long voyage following the delivery of supplies by independent pilots.
- June 10 - The source that tipped off Professor Alba Tesreau to the abandoned INRA base in the DG Canum Venaticorum system was revealed to be a survivor of Project Seraph. Project Seraph was a now-abandoned operation run by Azimuth Biochemicals at the Oaken Point facility in the HIP 26176 system. There, scientists attempted to directly interface with Thargoid scout vessels by grafting neural and physiological implants into living subjects. Most of the experiments ended in failure or death, but subject D-2 escaped from Oaken Point by stowing away on a trader's ship. From there, Subject D-2 investigated Azimuth using her inside knowledge and confirmed Aegis's belief that the corporation was still active.
- June 13 - The proposed strategic alliance between the Alliance and Sirius Corporation is hotly debated.
- June 14 - The Alliance, Empire, and Federation responded coolly to accusations that Salvation had hidden links to Azimuth Biochemicals and INRA. The Empire took a pragmatic approach, noting none of the Imperial weaponry could match the anti-xeno superweapon's capabilities. The Federation fleet admiral Tayo Maikori revived his investigation into Salvation in response and hoped to authenticate the INRA logs. In the Alliance, Admiral Rachel Ziegler was neutral about it.
- June 16 - The Di Jian system hosted rival campaigns as the Alliance Assembly voted on the strategic defense pact.
- June 17 - The generation ship Golconda departs from the Upaniklis system with much of its former population on board. After a three year period living aboard the outpost Forester's Choice, 60% of the 70,000 Golcondans have now chosen to resume their nomadic lifestyle aboard the ship. The Federation reiterated its protection of the Golcondans.

- June 30 - Salvation broadcast a message across all public channels announcing that the HIP 22460 system will be the site of a decisive strike against the Thargoids using a new superweapon he called the Proteus Wave, the construction of which had officially begun. Salvation predicted that the Guardian-based technology used in the Proteus Wave will attract the Thargoids as before, but the plan is to eradicate the Thargoid threat from the entire galaxy in an act of xenocide. To support the defense of humanity, Salvation announced the coordination of support operations aboard the megaship Bright Sentinel in addition to the support provided by the superpower militaries.
- June 30 - A coalition of independent pilots forms to destabilize Salvation's anti-xeno organization Azimuth Biotech. Despite the superpowers and most independent pilots supporting Azimuth, some chose to organize a resistance movement in a series of actions known as Operation Wych Hunt. The Commanders standing against Salvation claim he is responsible for illegal activities including mycoid weapon development, Project Seraph, and the destruction of the megaship Alexandria. The announcement of the Proteus Wave superweapon was the deciding catalyst for the formation of this resistance.
- June 30 - Commodore Morag Halloran, liason for Azimuth Biotech, made a request for military and medical commodities to be delivered to the HIP 22460 system at the Heart of Taurus megaship. These supplies were needed to support the cross-superpower operation.

Halloran explains that upon detonation, the energy pulse created by the Proteus Wave will cause catastrophic disruption to all Thargoid biomechanical technology within range, and that every alien vessel in HIP 22460 should immediately cease to function.
- August 9 - Following the activation of the Proteus Wave, communication with all ships in the HIP 22460 system terminates. After the energy pulse from the Proteus Wave disabled all Thargoids in the system, a second energy pulse of similar intensity from an undetermined source rendered the Bright Sentinel powerless and reactivated the disabled Thargoid vessels. The Alliance, Federation, and Empire all verify that they are no longer receiving signals from their capital ships. Azimuth Biotech is unable to contact the Bright Sentinel or Heart of Taurus megaships. There is no word from Salvation or any Azimuth personnel within the systems.
- August 10 - Following the failure of the Proteus Wave to destroy the Thargoids, the aliens overwhelmed the coalition fleet in HIP 22460 and conquered the system. HIP 22460 was declared off-limits to all civilian traffic and considered Thargoid territory.
- August 11 - The Thargoid victory in HIP 22460 raised questions that Azimuth and the superpowers are unable to respond to.
- August 12 - The superpowers confirm that the remains of their anti-xeno taskforces have fully retreated from HIP 22460. Across the core systems, public fears of a mass Thargoid invasion run high.
- August 15 - Anecdotal reports suggest that a previously unknown non-human object has been discovered by independent pilots. No details about where or how the object was obtained were established at the time. One source of information was a public message posted by Commander Marcus Mercer via an Interstellar Common Experience network.
- August 15 - Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Sirius Corporation CEO Li-Yong Rui issue a joint statement regarding territorial defense against the Thargoids. The Council of Admirals also officially verified that the Oath of Tyndareus was lost with all hands during the Thargoid counter-attack in the HIP 22460 system
- August 16 - A breakaway sect of the Thargoid-wroshipping Far God Cult celebrtes the massacre of human forces in HIP 22460 and celebrates the alien victory in a message broadcast from the megaship Testment by the anonymous woman known only as the First APostle of the True Chapters.
- August 17 - Professor Ishmael Palin, the foremost authority on the Thargoids, authors a short article for the scientific journal The Empirical. In this article, he writes about the mysteries presented by the Thargoids and how little humanity actually knows about them.
- August 19 - Professor Ishmael Palin and fellow engineer Ram Tah put out a call seeking deliveries of a newly discovered artifact. Palin explained the details of the unclassified relics as being Guardian in origin and that preliminary studies show differences in molecular alignments indicating that the relic emits both Thargoid and Guardian energy signatures. Ram Tah and Palin request independent pilots to make these deliveries to further research on the relics.
- August 22 - Federation President Zachary Hudson announced that 22 August 3308 will be a Federal Day of Remembrance for those lost at the HIP 22460 system on 9th August.
- August 23 - An independent journalist suggests that some survivors of the Battle of HIP 22460 heard a strange alien sound of unknown origin. Flint "Firemaker" Lafosse published his theories in the Rewired network, stating that the noise was described as *"ghastly"*, *"overwhelming"*, and *"monstrous"*.
- August 25 - It is confirmed that Salvation, the figurehead of Azimuth Biotech and the creator of the Proteus Wave, was killed aboard the Bright Sentinel. A segment of a transmission by an independent rescue team within HIP 22460 was shared with Vox Galactica by an anonymous source. This transmission stated that Salvation was in his command chair, surrounded by shattered fragments of cybernetic implants and his portable medical sensors dormant, and that despite his shredded and broken body, his eyes were frozen open. Azimuth Biotech has confirmed that these findings were believed to be accurate and no further statement has been made.
- August 25 - Sirius Corporation gathers resources in the Leesti system to help improve the Alliance's anti-xeno defenses. The campaign's conclusion was announced by Captain Delfina Domingues, commanding officer of the megaship Chariot of Rhea.
- August 26 - The Federal Attorney's Office calls for the conviction of former admiral Aden Tanner to be reviewed in light of events in HIP 22460. Tanner served as the chief military liaison for Aegis, and in November 3307 while in command of the Aegis Defense megaship Musashi, he attempted to take control of the Hind Mine starpot on the basis that he believed it held evidence that Salvation intentionally attracted the Thargoids to the Cornsar system in order to test his superweapon. Tanner's attack failed and the Musashi was overtaken. Tanner was subsequently court martialled, dishonorably discharged, and found guilty of mutiny and unlawful military action. His sentencing was postponed by Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori, who considered Tanner's intelligence to be crucial. The Federal Navy Criminal Court confirms that a formal application for a judiciary review was received and a special panel has been convened to reassess Tanner's case.
- August 27 - Ships traveling in the area of HIP 22460 begin reporting being hyperdicted by Thargoids at increased distances from the Thargoid-controlled system. Pilots reported similar hyperdictions in V0402 Aurigae, HR 1490, Synuefer SA-C b33-2, and sdeveral other systems.
- August 30 - Azimuth Biotech outlines plans for the corporation's future following the confirmation of Salvation's death.

#### September 3308

- September 1 - Azimuth Biotech calls for mining vessels to deliver cobalt, gallite, and osmium to the Glorious Prospect megaship in the LHS 157 system. Azimuth stated they would provide supporters with a permit to the Mbooni system if they didn't already have one from previous requests for aid. The purpose of the mining materials is stated to be related to infrastructure repair and recovery following the Proteus Wave disaster and attacks by pro-xeno protesters.
- September 1 - Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval made her first public announcement since the Battle of HIP 22460, stating that the collaboration with other superpowers and Salvation were a strategic error and relying upon Salvation's superweapon was a disastrous mistake that the Empire could not afford to repeat. The Emperor further stated that the Empire would no longer participate in any inter-superpower projects, and that the Imperial Navy had been commanded to focus exclusively on protecting the Empire's borders against their enemies regardless of origin. Previously allocated resources earmarked for these projects would be redirected internally.
- September 2 - The location of the first ever discovered green gas giant, a mystery for years, was rediscovered by a dedicated community of explorers. Commander Kelly Eldridge initially made the discovery on the 23rd of May 3301, noting the vivid green bands in the planet's atmosphere. Its precise location was lost due to failures in recordkeeping. However, in early 3308, Commander Richard Fluiraniz M gathered enthusiasts for an expedition titled "At The Eldritch Gate" to collectively search for the missing planet. The mission involved analyzing constellation patterns and interstellar gas clouds in the only available image taken by CMDR Eldridge. Eventually, a match was made on the 16th August by CMDR Orange!, who identified it as the seventh planet in the Shaulai DL-P d5-274 system.
- September 5 - Reports from independent explorers indicate that an unusual visual phenomenon has appeared in deep space. A distant point of light, described as a reddish-orange flare with faint radial patterns, is observed close to the Barnard's Loop nebula.

- September 15 - Classified audio-visual footage from the Battle of HIP 22460 is leaked to the public media by anonymous sources. These files include audio recordings of a broadcast of unknown origin that occurred throughout HIP 22460 and match previously unverified descriptions of a "Thargoid roar".
- September 16 - A special tribunal of the Federal Navy Criminal Court deliberates the case of former admiral Aden Tanner and made a final decision, releasing a statement to the press stating that the tribunal finds that Tanner's allegations are substantiated where it concerns provocation of hostile Thargoid responses on purpose by Salvation. Despite this finding, the tribunal upholds the original sentence on grounds that Tanner still directly disobeyed orders and denied a request for retrial. The tribunal statement concludes by acknowledging that Tanner's arguments made a good point, and commuted his sentence to time served and allowed him to leave Federal custody.
- September 20 - The Order of the Far-God comes under official investigation and public mistreatment within the Federation. Vox Galactica reports that Federal naval intelligence operatives are investigating all chapters of the cult within Federal space.

- September 23 - Inexplicable visual phenomena located in deep space cause extensive speculation and media interest. These "anomalies" appear as a bright flare with spiralling radial arms, emit electromagnetic feedback that can be detected using the FSS scanner, and are visible from great distances away. The first anomaly is discovered beyond the permit-locked Col 70 sector, with additional signals now observed. Multiple calculations verify that the objects are moving at faster-than-light speeds. The majority of speculation and theorycrafting around the anomalies assume they are related to the Thargoids.
- September 26 - The Federal government declares the Order of the Far God cult to be a potential enemy of a state in a statement delivered from the White House on Mars by the Federal Navy Intelligence Office. The FNIO stated that they have sufficient cause to suspect the Far God cult of treason.
- September 28 - Professor Alba Tesreau announces a bid to reform Aegis, inviting key political figures from all superpowers to a conference to win them over.

- September 29 - The Federation seeks to apprehend True Chapters cultists of the Far God cult. Federal authorities call on independent pilots to assist the Federation in their efforts to put an end to what the Federation calls pro-xeno treason.
- September 29 - Princess Aisling Duval's initiative in the Cemiess system procures sufficient quantities of rare items to be considered a success, and the Citizens' Relief Trust gala was resoundingly successful. The new charity will establish support centers for the relatives of Imperial citizens who have died as a result of Thargoid aggression.
- September 30 - Cynthia Sideris, chairperson of Universal Cartographics, announces an update to FSS scanners in order to help discover the nature of the interstellar anomalies. The FSS updates allow pilots to isolate the electromagnetic emissions of the anomaly signals in hopes of triangulating their positions more accurately and possibly determine their composition.
- September 30 - The militaries of the three superpowers are placed on high alert. The Federal Navy, Imperial Navy, and Allied Navy all continue to prepare for further Thargoid strikes.

#### October 3308

- October 3 - A three day long symposium begins that will outline proposals to reform Aegis, the tri-superpower anti-xeno agency. The event takes place at the national conference center in New Apollo City on the planet Biggs Colony, and is organized by Professor Alba Tesreau. Other plans to reform the organization were presented by former members of Aegis, and the Baumann Report was discussed. The audience was given evidence that the loss of the megaship Alexandria, originally seen as an example of Aegis's negligence, was actually due to sabotage and hijacking by Azimuth Biotech agents.
- October 4 - The sole survivor of Project Seraph unexpectedly appears at the Aegis symposium, surprising the live audience. As a discussion about the "Thargoid roar" heard at HIP 22460 was being discussed, a small figure in disheveled clothing slipped through event security and fought her way to the stage. The woman yelled that her name was Seo Jin-ae, and addressed Professor Tesreau directly saying that she didn't know where else to go. She added that she thought she knew what the Thargoid roar meant, and said that it was too late to stop what's coming. Seo Jin-ae, also known as Subject D-2, first came to light when the abandoned settlement Oaken Point was discovered in the HIP 26176 system. The logs found there described Project Seraph's attempts to create human pilots for Thargoid vessels, from which D-2 escaped by stowing away on a courier's ship. D-2 later contacted Professor Tesreau in June 3308 to expose the INRA base in the DG Canum Venaticorum system, which revealed Salvation's identity as Dr Caleb Wycherley of then-Azimuth Biochemicals.
- October 6 - An anti-xeno Alliance taskforce is deployed to defend the Andecavi system from the Thargoids in Operation Tyndareus. The Operation was recently prepared by the Alliance Defense Force in conjunction with Sirius Corporation. The Andecavi system reported the presence of Thargoids over the course of 48 hours but noted that no starports have yet been attacked.
- October 6 - Federal forces overwhelm the True Chapters sect in the Popontia system, successfully concluding the campaign against the Order of the Far God and their Workers of Popontia Free defenders. The two remaining Far God megaships, the Testament and the Perdition, abandoned their itinieraries and jumped to unknown locations to avoid further strikes by Federal forces. Before jumping, the First Apostle transmitted a message saying that the attempt to conceal the truth is doomed to fail, and warns that the Far Gods will bring humanity's unavoidable extinction.
- October 7 - Azimuth Biotech publicly offers assistance to Subject D-2, the Project Seraph survivor who gatecrashed the Aegis symposium on 4 October. Azimuth stated that the Project Seraph facilities were under Salvation's direct control and kept hidden from the wider corporation, and that the discovery of these sites was as much a shock to them as anyone else.
- October 10 - Federation Shadow President Felicia Winters criticizes the oppression of the Far God cultists following the battle and mass arrests at Popontia.
- October 11 - Subject D-2, Seo Jin-ae, refuses to have any further contact with Azimuth Biotech following its offer of help. Professor Alba Tesreau announced that Jin-ae is in her care and her health is improving. She stated that Jin-ae has a significant neural implant grafted into her cerebral cortex - designed to interface with a Thargoid vessel - which can never be removed. They are working with Jin-ae to better understand the manner of the surgeries inflicted on her alongside Professor Ishmael Palin and engineer Ram Tah. Azimuth Biotech expressed its disappointment at the response and attacked Jin-ae's legitimacy.
- October 13 - The Alliance taskforce under Operation Tyndareus successfully defended the Andecavi system from Thargoid vessels. The defense operation was centered around the megaship Kumiho Sky. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon expressed his gratitude for all those who took part.

- October 19 - President Zachary Hudson approves a congressional bill to outlaw the Order of the Far God within all Federal systems. Congress voted to accept the resolution by a narrow majority. Secretary of State Lana Berkovich stated that since the Thargoids are categorized as enemies of the state and the Federal Accord forbids any citizen from providing aid to such enemies, henceforth support and membership of the religious order is a crime punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment.
- October 20 - Channel 7 intercepts footage of a violent attack on three talk show hosts during a live broadcast across several Imperial newsfeeds. The show came to an abrupt halt after the three were apparently fired upon by an assailant who gained access to the enclosed set. The perpetrator managed to flee, but a digital calling card was left pinned to the host's dressing room door. The card contained a single word - TFZIRQRL - thought to be a text cipher.
- October 20 - Federal Governor Dalton Chase requests deliveries of computer components, semiconductors, and titanium to be made to Blenkinsop Hub in the Andavandul system. These materials are being gathered to establish a xeno-peace envoy vessel in the form of a megaship for use in Thargoid Advocacy Project operations.
- October 21 - Hadrian Augustus Duval, the illegitimate grandson of Emperor Hengist Duval, states his full support for the Empire's withdrawal from all cross-superpower operations.
- October 25 - Newsfeeds across the core systems reflect the increasing public demand for full-scale military cooperation against the Thargoids.
- October 27 - The human enclave within the California Nebula reports multiple attacks from Thargoid forces. Systems such as California Sector CQ-Y c5 and HIP 18077 experienced direct assaults by large numbers of Thargoid vessels. Megaships in the area were attacked and left in disrepair. Colonization of the California Nebula took place in 3302 and focused primarily on harvesting meta-alloys from Thargoid barnacle sites.
- October 27 - The Xeno-Peace Project gathers support as deliveries to the Andavandul system enable the Thargoid Advocacy Project to begin preparations for a diplomatic mission.
- October 28 - Ambassadors of all three superpowers held emergency talks following the attacks in the California Nebula, with the primary topic being a united military fleet.
- October 31 - The Imperial Senate debated contributing to anti-xeno activities such as Aegis or a unified superpower fleet. The debate ends with a reminder from Chancellor Anders Blaine that the Emperor had already decreed that there would be no further cross-superpower cooperation and that such a decree cannot be overruled even by the Senate.

#### November 3308

- November 1 - The Alliance Defense Force is unable to reach a consensus over the proposal to combine the superpowers' forces against the Thargoids.
- November 2 - The rise of the xeno-peace movement causes a number of public figures to discuss peaceful coexistence with the Thargoid race.
- November 3 - Azimuth Biotech announces a campaign in the Wandrama system to expand its military and surface facility capacity. A new megaship would be equipped and dispatched for operations in Thargoid-tainted systems and research projects would be carried out in the surface outposts.
- November 4 - It is confirmed that the mysterious anomalies, known as rogue signal sources (RSS), are all converging on the core systems. Professor Yaro Kenyatta collaborated with Professor Ishmael Palin and engineer Ram Tah to analyze the objects, publishing a summary of their work in the scientific journal The Empirical. The consensus is that the RSS are approaching the core systems but the exact arrival point and time had not been determined.
- November 7 - Dalton Chase is elected to the Federal Congress following victory in the recent special election after running on a xeno-peace platform.
- November 10 - Professors Alba Tesreau and Ishmael Palin, along with engineer Ram Tah, released a joint statement regarding the "Thargoid roar". Subject D-2 was instrumental in this effort to comprehend the meaning of the noise. Analysis showed that what was audible to humans was only part of a complex multi-frequency transmission amplified by the Thargoid surface site housing the Proteus Wave. The specifics remained indecipherable but Subject D-2 was able to isolate certain aspects. Jin-ae believes that it is a "call and response" element, as if the signal was a reply to the Thargoid forces in HIP 22460, interwoven with a sense of acknowledgement and focus which Jin-ae described as, *"We see them. We are coming."* Seo Jin-ae remains convinced that the rogue signal sources have been deployed by the Thargoids as a direct response to Salvation's Proteus Wave weapon.
- November 10 - Azimuth Biotech announces that its recent initiative to expand its operation assets was a partial success. The primary goal of obtaining sufficient resources to establish a new anti-xeno megaship was met and the ship is expected to be operational within the next few weeks.
- November 11 - A version of the FSS scanning software used to track the Thargoid anomalies is made available to the Pilots' Federation. Commanders experience reduced interference when using the FSS to focus on the anomalies.
- November 14 - The pro-peace movement disputes the idea that the rogue signal sources are part of a potential Thargoid offensive. Xenologists concluded that the anomalies are a reaction to events in HIP 22460 and may have dire consequences for humanity. Dalton Chase stated that the Kingfisher megaship was established to lead a mission of peace with the Thargoids.
- November 15 - Human colonists in the Coalsack Nebula raise the alarm after Thargoid forces appeared in several systems. Following recent attacks on systems and vessels in the California Nebula, it appears that the Thargoids have again sought to occupy systems where barnacle fields are present on planet surfaces. Azimuth Biotech also announced that the Glorious Prospect megaship will distribute Mbooni permits for pilots seeking to purchase anti-xeno weaponry.
- November 15 - The announcement that the rogue signal sources heading towards the core systems are Thargoid in origin causes unease within the general public. Protests in systems on the edge of human space experience riots, demanding assurances from local governments about their safety. The primary concern is the failure to establish a collective human fleet to counter Thargoid incursions.
- November 17 - The Kingfisher megaship requests supplies for its planned journey to greet the first rogue signal source. Shipments of basic medicines, fruit and vegetables are required for the Kingfisher's crew, and semiconductors and muon imagers are requested to establish the mission's communication arrays. Congressman Dalton Chase stated the intention of the Kingfisher to meet the first anomaly, named Taranis, in the Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1 system.
- November 21 - The rogue signal sources draw closer to human space as work is underway to initiatie peaceful inter-series negotiations. Dr Elias Pope, a graduate with degrees in interstellar relations, political science, and xenology, joined the Kingfisher's crew to oversee the Thargoid Advocacy Project's diplomatic mission. He expressed hope that the best-case scenario is that whatever controls Taranis hears and responds in kind to diplomatic overtures.
- November 22 - The Kingfisher megaship has received commodities in advance of its mission to communicate with the ROSS Taranis. The Kingfisher will make the journey from Andavandul to Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1 within 48 hours. Congressman Dalton Chase would not be on board the Kingfisher, despite his prominent role in organizing the construction.
- November 23 - Dalton Chase applauded the incrased public support for the goal of opening diplomatic channels with the Thargoids in an interview with ICE-caster Joy Senne. He regrets not being able to join his campaigners aboard the Kingfisher, citing congressional duties and commitments.
- November 24 - Contact with the Kingfisher megaship is lost in the Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1 just over a day since its arrival in-system. The Kingfisher was equipped to transmit signals to the Taranis anomaly with the goal of opening communications. The Federation responded to this news by canceling the permit restriction for all vessels except fleet carriers and with access to the system restored, Federal investigators were dispatched to assess the situation. Observers confirmed that the Taranis anomaly passed through Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1 at faster than light speed, and continues to move towards the core systems as the other anomalies do.
- November 25 - Investigations in the Hyades Sector YO-Q b5-1 system confirm that Thargoid vessels attacked and destroyed the Kingfisher megaship. A vociferous backlash against the Thargoid Advocacy Project is triggered in response alongside reports that a log was discovered in the wreckage of the megaship. The log was made by Dr Elias Pope, who was overseeing attempts to communicate with the Thargoids. The log apparently describes what happened when the Taranis anomaly passed through the system.
- November 28 - The Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 system is identified as the location where RSS Tanaris will arrive.
- November 29 - Vista Genomics increases payments for genetic data collected by independent pilots.
- November 29 - The Taranis anomaly arrives in the Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 system and unleashes a wave of Thargoid invasion fleets in the region. Multiple inhabited systems experience wide-scale invasions by countless numbers of Thargoid vessels, with casualties expected to number millions within days. There are conflicting reports of the rogue signal source itself, with reports saying that Taranis is not a single object buyt a colossal swirling maelstrom of some kind.
- November 30 - Nine systems are overrun by the Thargoids after six populated systems close to Taranis's arrival point are overwhelmed.

#### December 3308

- December 1 - Two more rogue signal sources reach human space. The Indra anomaly arrives in the HIP 20567 system and the Leigong anomaly arrives in the HIP 8887 system. The Maelstroms, as they have been classified, manifest as enormous gaseous clouds that are hazardous to any ship venturing too close. Each new Maelstrom triggered subsequent invasions of nearby systems. 16 systems currently face active Thargoid invasions and transmit emergency calls for assistance. Rescue megaships are designated as refugee centers as the superpowers position anti-xeno capital ships to defend their territories.
- December 5 - Millions of refugees are being evacuated from systems suffering devastating attacks by Thargoid fleets. Captain Justine Kemp of Rescue Ship Hutner described humanitarian operations to Vox Galactica.
- December 6 - Engineers Liz Ryder and Zacariah Nemo reveal designs for improved anti-xeno weaponry available for pilots. The designs are enhanced fixed and turreted AX multi-cannons and missile racks, with gimballed AX multi-cannons in the works.

- December 15 - Enhanced AX weaponry becomes available following the success of the project by Liz Ryder and Zacariah Nemo.
- December 15 - Corrs Toy Emporium calls for help from independent pilots to deliver toys to children across the Bubble
- December 16 - The final three rogue signal sources - Thor, Raijin and Hadad - arrive at their estimated destinations with identical impact as the previous Maelstrom arrivals. All eight Maelstroms are now established at their destination in a broad semi-circle along the fringe of the core systems and each entity has become the center of an expanding Thargoid sphere of influence. Eleven rescue megaships have entered service at key locations to aid and process millions of refugees fleeing these attacks.
- December 19 - Thargoid vessels begin interdicting human ships out of Supercruise in-system alongside hyperdicting pilots as has been well documented. Pilots traveling through or near systems with Thargoid presences have an increased risk of hyperdiction and interdiction while in supercruise.
- December 20 - Fears over the Thargoid invasion spark public gatherings outside the Imperial Palace on Capitol, prompting a spontaneous speech by Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval.
- December 26 - Shadow President Felicia Winters calls for the Federal Navy to help defend independent systems being invaded by the Thargoids.
- December 27 - Professor Alba Tesreau again calls for the reformation of Aegis in the face of the Thargoid onslaught.

### 3309

#### January 3309

- January 3 - Azimuth Biotech outlined its plans to support the war effort against the Thargoids by improving ship anti-xeno firepower. The CEO, Torben Rademaker, explained that their idea was to increase the upper limit of AX weapons a ship could utilize by working with the enhanced AX weapon designs provided by engineers Zacariah Nemo and Liz Ryder.
- January 5 - Seo Jin-ae, also known as Subject D-2, unexpectedly disappeared after departing the facility she had been staying at. Jin-ae sent a message to Professor Alba Tesreau explaining that the disappearance was voluntary, but no other information was forthcoming.
- January 9 - The court martial verdict of Admiral Aden Tanner is officially overturned by an executive order from President Zachary Hudson. The Office of the Federal President published a statement commending Tanner's record and actions, and justified his violation of protocol based on sound intelligence. Tanner is recruited back to fighting the Thargoids.
- January 12 - Azimuth Biotech unveils protoypes of a module that improves hardpoint capacity for anti-xeno ships at the TZ Arietis Weapon Expo. The medium variant of the stabilizer allows one additional experimental weapon to be installed, while the large variant allows two additional experimental weapons. Both variants support the enhanced AX missile racks and multi-cannons.
- January 16 - Princess Aisling Duval publicly asks Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval to reconsider pledging Imperial resources to a cross-superpower anti-xeno initiative. No response from the Imperial Palace was given.
- January 19 - Azimuth Biotech announces an initiative to manufacture modules that increase AX weapons capacity, requesting deliveries of meta-alloys, insulating membrances, HN shock mounts, and beryllium to be delivered to the megaship Glorious Prospect in the LHS 1163 system.
- January 23 - Princess Aisling Duval's pro-Aegis stance received a harsh response from Admiral Denton Patreus in an interview with Eye of Achenar. Duval was also criticized by Senator Zemina Torval, but Senator Caspian Leopold offered words of support in her defense.
- January 26 - Azimuth Biotech's delivery initative in LHS 1163 comes to a successful conclusion and the class 3 experimental weapon stabilizer becomes available. Azimuth PR released a statement saying, *"This variant of Azimuth's experimental weapons stabilizer is now widely available for purchase. by redirecting and absorbing internal stresses, it allows a ship to carry a total of five AX weapons rather than the previous limit of 4."* A Class 5 variant is scheduled to release a week later, which will allow two additional AX weapons.  In response, retail outlets reported an increase in purchases for both AX missile racks and multi-cannons.
- January 27 - An improved xeno scanner is released to assist combat vessels engaged in AX operations. The new scanner's range has been extended to 2 kilometers.
- January 27 - The Kumo Crew syndicate rallied in the California Nebula and repelled the region's Thargoid invasion forces. The Kumo Council called in reinforcements to the three systems it governs, and local security forces organized counter-attacks against Thargoid vessels.  The Pegasi Sentinel newsfeed published a request for populations to not impede Kumo Crew activity, suggesting the fleet mobilization was a temporary measure to coordinate resistance against the Thargoids.  This message was rejected by Turner Research Group, who controls several of the invaded systems. This organization was established by the Alliance in 3302 to study the barnacles discovered in the region.  Harrison Gladstone, the group's spokesperson, declared that Delaine was using the Thargoid attacks as a pretense to grab power.
- January 30 - Admiral Aden Tanner formally resigned his commission with the Federal Navy weeks after a presidential pardon overturned his court martial. He had returned to service following an executive order from President Zachary Hudson.  Tanner released a personal statement, published by The Federal Times, stating his thanks and gratitude for the pardon and for his vindication, but felt that he could best act against the Thargoids outside of the confines of the Naval structure.
- January 31 - Princess Aisling Duval met with Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval in person to discuss an Imperial contribution to the reformation of Aegis.  Duval's arrival at the Imperial Palace was unexpected. The Emperor eventually announced that the decree to isolate from the other superpowers remained active, however if Aegis were to be re-established, a limited number of scientists and naval vessels would be allocated to the anti-xeno agency. Aisling Duval would take ownership of the endeavour and coordinate with both Imperial and foreign organizations.

#### February 3309

- February 1 - Azimuth Biotech released a new module that allows two additional AX weapons to be added to large ships. The new module is a class 5 variant and allows a total of six AX weapons to be used on the ship.
- February 2 - The Kumo Crew continues rallying against Thargoid attacks in the California Nebula by offering rewards for eliminating Thargoid vessels.  The Kumo Council is asking independent pilots to take part in an anti-xeno initiative in the region, coordinated from The Mictlan megaship. Harrison Gladstone of the Turner Research Group, representatives of the Alliance in the region, made a formal protest, citing their displeasure at the defense initatives being funded by a criminal gang.
- February 6 - The Alliance Assembly voted to make a contribution to Aegies if the agency is reformed by the three superpowers. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon made an official announcement committing ships, resources, and personnel to a collaborative anti-xeno agency.  He also stated that the strategic defense pact with the Sirius Corporation remains in effect and the company continues to work with the Alliance on protecting Allied systems.
- February 7 - Anti-authoritarian protests surge in the Alliance, Empire, and Federation with governments accused of responsibility for Thargoid hostility. Vox Galactica's political correspondent Conrad Sterling published a special report, in summary stating that the xeno-peace movement lost a lot of momentum following the arrival of the Maelstroms, but blaming the Alliance, Federation, and Empire for allowing the war to escalate with profits from corporate arms deals seen as the motive.  Activism swept the core systems including civil lawsuits, protest marches, and clashes with security personnel. There were also attempted break-ins at administrative complexes and politicians' homes, where some activists believed proof of conspiracy could be found. Allied Interpol and the Imperial Internal Security Service claimed that the public disorder was under control, while the Proactive Detection Bureau begun identifying and "pre-cautioning" Federal citizens who express anti-authority sympathies.
- February 9 - The Kumo Crew's initative to defend the California Nebula was successful, culminating on February 9, 3309. While the Thargoids were driven off, Delaine's attempts to assume control of the region's ports were repelled by his opponents.
- February 10 - President Zachary Hudson and Shadow President Felicia Winters united behind Federal backing for the reformation of Aegis. The Federal Congress held an emergency debate after the Alliance and Empire agreed to support an official tri-superpower initative against the Thargoids. A majority of votes from Republican, Liberal, and independent representatives approved the provision of ships, personnel, and materials from the federation. President Hudson also delivered a short address to mark the occasion.
- February 13 - The anti-xeno agency Aegis was officially reformed by the Alliance, Empire, and Federation. Aegis was initially founded in 3303 to centralize research into the Thargoids, as well as coordinate defense and rescue operations. It was disbanded in 3308 following accusations of incompetence in the wake of the Alexandria disaster and the subsequent findings of the Baumann Report. The recent escalation of the Thargoid War renewed calls for collaboration between the superpowers and the reversal of the decision to disband Aegis.
- February 16 - Populated systems in the Witch Head Nebula were overrun by Thargoid fleets, resulting in widespread chaos.  Thargoid vessels directly targeted starports and planetary bases, causing tens of thousands of casualties. Rescue services struggled in aiding the fleeing survivors due to the nebula's location hundreds of lightyears from the core systems.
- February 17 - Princess Aisling Duval assumed oversight of the Empire's contributions to the Aegis agency.
- February 20 - Aegis produced a prototype module that increases a ship's ability to survive caustic environments. This will allow ships to explore the Maelstrom anomalies.
- February 23 - Aegis launches a Caustic Sink Launcher initative. Deliveries of advanced catalyzers, heatsink interlinks, palladium, and caustic generators were accepted at the Orunmilla megeaship in the Duamta system.
- February 23 - Thargoid War Update for February 3309: Thargoid fleets have continued expanding outwards from the eight Maelstroms. 61 systems were fully liberated from Thargoid control out of a total of 634 overrun systems. Fierce fighting was seen in the California and Witch Head Nebulas, with speculation that the Thargoids sought to secure the barnacle sites in those regions.  Practical support arrived in the form of Azimuth Biotech's experimental weapons stabilizers and Professor Palin's improved xeno scanner, along with the resurrection of Aegis.
- February 27 - Trillionaire entrepreneur Zachary Rackham launched his campaign to be elected Federal president in the upcoming election. He gave a statement outlining several policies of his platform.

#### March 3309

- March 2 - Universal Cartographics announced a two-week initiative to locate planets with ammonia atmospheres. The survey was outlined by Cynthia Sideris, chairperson of Universal Cartographics.  Aegis requested the update to Universal Cartographics' database of terrestrial planets with ammonia atmospheres, under the logic that it was no coincidence that each Maelstrom was located in a system containing such words, given that Thargoid biochemistry is ammonia-based. Aegis and Universal Cartographics liaise to chart as many ammonia worlds as possible to identify potential staging grounds for Thargoid fleets and arrival points for additional Maelstroms.
- March 2 - Aegis's initiative in the Duamta system kick-started production of a ship module designed for caustic environments. Shipments of advanced catalyzers, heatsink interlinks, and palladium were delivered following a request from Professor Alba Tesreau. Pilots also provided tissue samples extracted from the caustic generators inside each Maelstrom, which are a vital component of these modules. Manufacturing bases were established, allowing stocks of the caustic sink launcher to reach the public.
- March 6 - The Marlinist Colonies struggle to survive the harsh realities of independence while preparing for the impact of the Thargoid War. An editorial in The Marlin Standard summarized their situation
- March 7 - The Alliance formally condemned the Kumo Crew syndicate in the California Nebula following recent activities. Councillor Jed Trager supervised an investigation into the Kumo Council's attempt to take control of several systems, ostensibly to defend them against a wave of Thargoid attacks.
- March 9 - Archon Delaine rejected Prime Minister Mahon's warning over an alleged attempt to gain control of systems in the California Nebula.
- March 14 - Preliminary motions on the Hudson Contravention vote began in the Federal Congress. The proposal, named after President Zachary Hudson's call to suspend the 77th amendment to the Federal Accord, was a point of significant contention. If approved, Hudson would be eligible to run for another term in this year's elections, breaking with centuries of constitutional law.
- March 16 - An analysis of the ongoing Thargoid war was released by Aegis and made available to all superpowers and independent navies. The focus of the report centres on protecting systems at threat of Thargoid invasion. It suggests that anti-xeno forces are primarily fighting Thargoid invasion fleets which have already arrived, understandable due to the immediate risk to civilian life. However, Aegis proposes that increasing defensive efforts for systems at threat of invasion would be a more efficient way of slowing the spread of Thargoid-controlled territory.
- March 16 - Aegies and Universal Cartographics announced that the project to survey ammonia worlds ended satisfactorily.
- March 20 - An anonymous source leaked information regarding Seo Jin-ae suggesting that she may be in serious jeopardy. Seo Jin-ae, the individual once known as Subject D-2, voluntarily departed from a private medical facility in January, where she was under the care of former Aegis members. She left a message stating, *“I have unfinished business with Salvation.”*
- March 21 - President Hudson's motion to allow him to serve a second term of office was defeated by congressional vote. The proposal would have temporarily repealed the 77th amendment of the Federal Accord, which sets a maximum presidential term of eight years. A narrow majority voted not to accept this change to the Federation’s constitution.
- March 23 - Seo Jin-ae arrived safely in the Luyten's Star system aboard an Order of the Far God megaship. A message was transmitted by the First Apostle of the True Chapters, a proactive sect of the pacifistic religion, from aboard the Testament: *“The one known to non-believers as Subject D-2 or Seo Jin-ae is sacred to us as the Preceptor – the first human to interpret the will of the Far God. We know her to be a holy emissary, on a personal pilgrimage that exposed her to great danger. I was able to convince my brethren to locate the Preceptor and offer her safe harbour from the heretics.”*
- March 28 - The Liberal Party and Felicia Winters published a detailed political manifesto in advance of the Federation's presidential election in June.
- March 29 - Thargoid war update: March 3309. There have been few significant changes in Thargoid tactics. The eight Maelstroms continued to send waves of Thargoid vessels deeper into the core systems.
- March 30 - Aegis published a personal statement from Seo Jin-ae, who claimed to have evidence that Salvation planned to escape death in the HIP 22460 system: *“First of all, yes, Caleb Wycherley died when the Thargoids attacked the Bright Sentinel in HIP 22460. But, I believe, only physically. He was developing technology to automatically relocate his mind, an emergency protocol he named the Nemesis Failsafe. I know how implausible that sounds, but the files I recovered from an Azimuth Biotech archive prove his intentions. For several years, Salvation ran a private project to reverse-engineer a Guardian artefact which could store consciousness. The design showed neural interactions as digital impulses, and made reference to exactly retaining his identity and memories.”*
- March 31 - Johann Fleischer, recently appointed head of the mining coproration Caine-Massey, was shot and killed on Mars. Fleischer was attending a Federal Commerce Authority seminar at the Olympus Village Conference Centre. He was targeted in the audience by long-range plasma fire that proved immediately fatal. Security forces were unable to locate the shooter but the weapon and other items were recovered.

#### April 3309

- April 3 - Azimuth Biotech rejected Seo Jin-ae’s unverified claim that Salvation survived by relocating his mind using advanced Guardian technology. CEO Torben Rademaker stated that Azimuth Biotech had no knowledge of any project related to a "Nemesis Failsafe". He also confirmed that relocating one's mind, using advanced Guardian technology, was not possible, and he believed that Seo Jin-ae’s might have been suffering from paranoid delusions, and falsified data to support her personal vendetta. Moreover, she seemed to be also a high-ranking member of Far God cult. Also in the filed of exoneurology some tests were conducted in order to examine if isolating human mind from neuronal network and transferring it to an artificial host was manageable. As of April 3rd, only the Utopia commune allegedly claimed significant success.

- April 4 - Federal mining corporation Caine-Massey accused Senator Zemina Torval of orchestrating an assassination on its CEO Johann Fleischer. FIA managed to assemble security footage and deduced that an assassin had departed from Olympus Village Spaceport using a falsified Federal ID and then was using another alias as a prospector for Torval Mining Ltd. That way, he managed to get close enough to assassinate CEO Johan Fleischer. All evidence pointed out to Zemina Torval orchestrating Johann's death as an act of revenge, following her defeat in her efforts to obtain one of the most lucrative mining contracts. However, as of April 4th Senator Torval neither acknowledged nor responded to the accusation. Nevertheless, an official statement on that matter was sent to Congress by the Imperial Senate, in which Imperial Senate declared that none of its bodies were connected to these events. Furthermore, President Zachary Hudson assured that further resources would be distributed in order to solve that heinous crime.

- April 5 - The Republican Party announced that its Vice President Jerome Archer would be a candidate in the upcoming Federal election. Formerly, Archer served as the secretary of security in President Zachary Hudson's cabinet. He was promoted as a vice president, following death of his predecessor during the Nine Martyrs attacks in 3307. As a new vice president, Archer proved to be very efficient, as he immediately proposed the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act. This act aimed to monitor all civilian communications in the Federation to detect and neutralize potential terrorist threats as soon as possible. Throughout his election campaign, Archer demonstrated a commitment to the safety of Federal citizens. He expressed a profound admiration for President Zachary Hudson, and ensured citizens that Hudson's legacy would continue under his leadership, implying that his main goal, after winning the presidency election, was to strengthen military capabilities. Nonetheless, opinions on Archer's leadership varied among different media outlets. For example, newsfeed Sol Today was highly supportive of Acher and the Republican Party, stating that they were the best choice amid the ongoing Thargoid war. In contrast, Federal Free Press believed that if Archer were successful of becoming a new President, then such things like privacy would become a mere history.

- April 6 - The death of Caine Massey's CEO sparked conflict between the Federation corporation and Imperial rival, Torval Mining Ltd. Acting CEO Philippa Barlow-Lyons stated that upon learning whereabouts of Johann Fleischer's assassin, they demanded that he be handed over to stand trial for his crime. However, the Torval Mining Ltd decided not to respond to any of accusations. Therefore, Caine-Massey business partner, Tavgi Blue Life Inc, was tasked to board the Orchestral Falcon, on which the criminal had boarded, and apprehend the suspect by any means necessary. The CEO also declared that they would do whatever it takes to arrest the Imperial Intelligence agent for his crime. Additionally, Senator Zemina Torval decided to response to these allegations, stating that Caine Massey corporation was using its CEO's death deliberately, in order to shattered her company reputations. Unfortunately, that conflict also ominously heightened political tensions between Federation and Empire. Although majority of naval forces from both superpowers had been deployed to stop the Thargoid invasion, system authority vessels around Tavgi - system where the last time alleged criminal was seen - were placed on alert. President Zachary Hudson quickly responded that the administration upheld the right for federal factions to seek justice. Senator Denton Patreus stated too that the Empire was ready to shield its citizens, businesses and territories from attacks by foreign powers.

- April 10 - Similarities between the Nemesis Failsafe and Utopia's Sim-Archive led to the possibility of a connection between the two. Independent journalist Filnt Lafosse reported on Seo Jin-ae’s latest discoveries, suggesting that it can be assumed that Salvation might have transferred his mind after his original body died, using Antal's system, which is well known to be capable of digitizing one's brain. However, Lafosse was also wondering that perhaps Azimuth and Utopia might have been secretly working together, implying that the Sim-Archive could have always been Guardian-based. This theory was criticized by The Federal Time's technology correspondent Harlow Nassry who pointed out  that, despite examining few inventions, none of them contained any molecular markers of Guardian origin. Nassry also stated that the Sim-Archive's memory-recording techniques were based on exoneurological research conducted over hundreds of years. Dr Maximo Fonesca, The Alliance's scientifitic liaison to Aegis also gave statement to the media that he and his research group had been invited to Utopia by Pranav Antal in order to discuss the situation and determine whether a formal investigation into Salvation's status is warranted.

- April 13 -

- April 17 - A scientific delegation from Aegis visited Utopia to compare its Sim-Archive with Salvation's Failsafe designs. During the meeting the research group came to conclusion that Salvation's Failsafe designs were vastly different from Sim-Archive. Aegis declared that the Nemesis process irreversibly transformed a person's entire neuronal network into esoteric energy particles, unlike Sim-Archive which main goal is to only preserve human thought for future generations. Aegis also confirmed that Nemesis Failsafe relied heavily on Guardian technology, which as of April 17th remained an incomprehensible mystery. Additionally, all three superpowers agreed that Salvation had not received any assistance from the Utopia commune.

- April 18 - Allied and independent leaders called upon the Empire and the Federation to discourage faction hostilities following conflict in Tavgi. Due to the conflict between two corporations, Caine-Massey and Torval Mining Ltd, many systems where Federal and Imperial populations coexist were experiencing civil tension and spates of public disturbance. There were also concerns that historic rivalry between two superpowers might have been rekindled. However, in the Alliance Assembly, there were discussions about the Alliance potentially taking more responsibility for protecting more independent systems from Thargoid invasion. In response, Prime Minister Mahon agreed to send envoys from the Alliance Office of Diplomatic Relations to both superpowers.

- April 20 - Factions aligned to the Empire and Federation declared war in Pichch, which lies in the path of Thargoid expansion. Exacerbation of hostility between the two superpowers in Pichch system was caused, by the previous corporate skirmish in Tavgi. Furthermore, the conflict in Pichch system had also impacted on the ongoing war against the Thargoids, as the Pichch system was an extremely valuable resource for anti-xeno weaponary and key supplier in the region where Maelstrom Leigong had arrived. Moreover, there were significant concerns that this conflict, amid the Thargoid invasion, could potentially weaken defences in multiple systems.

- April 24 - Prototypes were created of a new module designed to counteract the massive energy surge within Thargoid Maelstroms. The new device granted access to the innermost regions of the Thargoid clouds, which could reveal highly anticipated knowledge about the Thargoid invasions. Additionally, Aegis confirmed that first tests would be conduct unmanned in order to examine if Prototypes work properly.

- April 25 - The assassin who shot Caine-Massey CEO Johann Fleischer was cleared of any connection to the Empire. The Federal Intelligence Agency confirmed that the suspect was a professional mercenary, who over a decade had been operating as a freelance contract killer using multiple falsified identities. Nonetheless, no evidence was found that Rayne had been hired by Torval Mining Ltd to eliminate Mr Fleischer. The missions was  arranged anonymously via an unregistered comms network, which as of April 25th had not been accessed. Moreover, the Imperial-issue weapon and security equipment were deliberately chosen for this particular task in order to foster the impression that assassination had been ordered by elements within the Empire. Furthermore, Federal Congress accepted the report and stated that no further action would be taken, and that after the questioning Rayne would face a life sentence in a maximum-security prison. Additionally, the new appointed CEO Philippa Barlow-Lyons gave statement that to commemorate Johann Fleischer, she aimed to run things exactly as Mr Fleischer would have wanted, and that Caine-Massey would withdraw accusation against Zemina Torval and her family

- April 27 - Aegis prototype Thargoid pulse neutralisers succeeded in allowing transit through the energy surge at the center of the Maelstrom. The probes which had been sent into the Taranis Maelstrom, successfully insulated from colossal electromagnetic. The method used to protect the probes was developed, thanks to research conducted on an unclassified relics recovered from Thargod surface sites, which with a contact of electrical charge, emitted  an energy field on similar frequencies to the Maelstrom's pulse. Additionally, Aden Tanner gave report that his team was conducting secondary tests in order to improve the quality of the new neutraliser that it could be best suited to explore innermost parts of Maelstroms

## Notes

- This is a fictional timeline and as such some listed events do not correspond to actual historical events such as if, when, and where they occurred in actual history.
- In *Frontier: First Encounters*, there were multiple endings depending on player action. One involved the player stealing a vaccine for the mycoid virus from INRA and delivering it to the Thargoids, resulting in them rewarding you with a Thargoid ship, and meetings taking place between them and humanity's scientists. There was another ending where the player is instead given a more potent version of the mycoid virus by INRA and delivers this to the Thargoids instead of a vaccine, meaning no Thargoid ship was gifted to humanity and no exchanges of scientific data occurred. The announcement was that this is the actual history of events for *Elite Dangerous*. Executive Producer Michael Brookes clarified, *"This is correct, there was no official agreement, or cooperation between humanity and the Thargoids in the Elite: Dangerous history. There has been some unofficial contact though."*^[92]^ The event in the novel Out of the Darkness by T. James is one of the unofficial points of contact that have occurred. ^[93]^
