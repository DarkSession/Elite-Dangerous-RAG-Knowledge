# Treaty of Paresa
The **Treaty of Paresa** was ratified by the Imperial Senate on November 16, 3306. It removed Nova Imperium's status as a proscribed organisation outside of its home system of Paresa in exchange for its cooperation in Imperial operations against the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army and its acknowledgement of Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval as the Empire's rightful ruler.^[1]^ The treaty also contained a mutual defence clause.^[2]^ Previously, Nova Imperium had been outlawed for sedition against the Empire since January 25, 3305, when its original leader, Duke Kaeso Mordanticus, was executed before the Senate and a purge was undertaken against the group's supporters.^[3]^^[4]^ After Nova Imperium reorganised into Nova Paresa on November 2, 3307, the treaty remained in effect.^[5]^

The Treaty of Paresa was accompanied by a royal decree from Emperor Arissa that denied Hadrian Augustus Duval, then the Imperator of Nova Imperium, the royal title of prince and any formal position within the Imperial Family, but recognized him as a Duval by blood and granted him and his followers royal pardons for their past crimes against the Empire.^[1]^
