### Purpose

Monitors the treatment and transportation of Imperial Slaves

The **Imperial Slavers Association (ISA)**,^[1]^ also called the **Imperial Slave Association**,^[2]^ is an Imperial organization that monitors the treatment and transportation of Imperial Slaves under the Empire's practice of Imperial Slavery. The ISA and slavers must comply with Imperial laws. Violations of regulations tend to occur most frequently in systems near the Empire's borders.^[2]^

The ISA operates slave training facilities in Imperial space to train an unregulated workforce of slaves up to an appropriately Imperial standard. These facilities feature skill implantation terminals, body sculpting shops, ISA-certified retraining regimes, the best trainers and materials, modern technology, and more. One of the ISA's newest slave training academies was opened aboard Lagerkvist Gateway in the Synteini system on March 1, 3301.^[1]^

The sale of Imperial slaves to non-Imperials and to systems beyond Imperial space is strictly prohibited by order of the Imperial Senate. Anyone who is found engaging in this illicit activity will be held accountable. ISA members who conduct such illicit activities will be removed from the guild and reported to the appropriate authorities.^[2]^ People who are found to hold Imperial slaves beyond their fixed term of service receive a warning. Imperial slaves found in these circumstances are restored to full citizenship and reimbursed for the labour they performed beyond their established term. The slavers are subsequently indicted for these violations.^[2]^

## Timeline

14 SEP 3301

- Following the recent audit of the Imperial Slave Association, the Imperial Senate Audit Committee has recommended the introduction of further regulations governing the treatment and transportation of Imperial slaves. The proposed regulations centre on improved vetting of commanders permitted to transport Imperial slaves, and include the suggestion that pilots must hold the rank of 'Master' in the Imperial Navy as a minimum requirement. It is also suggested that resources be set aside for the recovery of Imperial slaves transported and sold outside the Imperium. Svetlana Zhukov, chairwoman of the ISA, voiced her support for the regulations: "It is our duty to ensure that Imperial citizens serving terms as slaves remain within the borders of the Empire until they are returned to full citizenship. Our hope is that these new regulations will ensure the rights of Imperial Slaves are not trampled on by those unscrupulous enough to sell people for quick credits." Political commentators have expressed doubt that the proposed regulations will be approved, but many remain hopeful.

- A surprise audit of the Imperial Slave Association was recently conducted by a special committee of the Imperial senate. The records and practices of the ISA were meticulously examined to ensure compliance with laws governing the treatment and transportation of Imperial slaves. The committee found numerous violations of transportation regulations in systems near Imperial borders, and numerous border-security officers and pilots were subsequently indicted for these violations. No serious violations concerning the treatment of Imperial Slaves were uncovered, though many warnings were issued to those who were found holding slaves beyond their fixed term of service. Imperial slaves found in these circumstances were restored to full citizenship and reimbursed for the labour they performed beyond their established term. The ISA issued a statement following the audit: "We wish to reiterate that the sale of Imperial slaves to non-Imperials and to systems beyond Imperial space is strictly prohibited. Any who are found engaging in this illicit activity will be held accountable."

- Reports are coming in from the Pegasi sector of scores of marked slaves being rescued by Imperial Commanders participating in the 'United Offensive'. Acting in concert with members of the Sirius Corporation, Imperial Commanders are carefully extracting human cargo from Kumo Crew vessels. The cargo is then delivered to Sirius Corp Commanders, who fly them to safety for relocation. Unconfirmed rumours indicate that members of the Utopians are also joining the rescue and relocation efforts. Spokesmen for the Kumo Crew have vehemently denied that marked slaves are anything but common criminals and degenerates, but one prominent case has received coverage on media circuits. Known only by her first name (for her own protection), former slave Aasha has become the face of the United Offensive. "Imagine my surprise when I woke up from stasis in Comanga surrounded by pirates!" Aasha originally entered a two-year Imperial slavery contract as part of the Quivira settlement with Silver Universal PLC. "I thought it was the right thing to do", said Aasha. "I was a trained mechanical engineer and could fetch a shorter term than any anyone else in my family. The pirates said that's what made me so valuable." Imperial Slavers Associated reiterated its previously stated opposition to transporting slaves outside the Empire. They added that any Imperial slave rescued from the Kumo Crew, or any violation of their terms of service agreement, would result in that slave's contract being rendered null and void. "I don't know the Commander who saved me", a tearful Aasha explained, "but I am so thankful to them, and the friendly folks at Sirius who helped me get to the relocation authority on Munshin."

13 JUN 3301

- On the edges of Imperial space, the line between savagery and civilisation blurs on an almost daily basis. Never has this been more apparent than this weekend, during which hundreds of supposedly honourable Imperial commanders crossed the border to smuggle massive quantities of Imperial Slaves to sell in black markets controlled by the Kumo Crew. Exactly what the Kumo Crew plans to do with the Imperial Slaves is unknown, although given how much the Kumo Crew were paying for them it's almost certainly not going to be pleasant. Under Imperial law, citizens are not permitted to sell their Imperial Slaves for service to non-Imperial citizens, nor are they allowed to sell Imperial Slaves on worlds outside of Imperial space. Those found breaking the law run the risk of being forced into service themselves, although in reality Imperial frontier security services tend to turn a blind eye to the practice. GalNet reached out to the Imperial Slavers Association and received the following statement: "The sale of Imperial Slaves outside of the borders of Imperial space is strictly prohibited by order of the Senate. Any members of the ISA found engaging in such activity will be removed from the guild and reported to the appropriate authorities."^[5]^

21 APR 3301

- The Imperial Slavers Association was supposed to make 5 million Imperial Slaves available for a significant discount in the markets aboard Lagerkvist Gateway. Much to the dismay of hundreds of eager Imperial traders, the slaves (and their associated discount) were delayed by members of Princess Lavigny-Duval's retinue as they attempted to pass through LTT 9810. This unfortunate snafu meant that the ISA was unable to make good on Senator Zemina Torval's promise. Reports from those close to the Senator state that Zemina was furious when she learned that Princess Arissa's agents had seized her shipment.^[6]^

08 APR 3301

- The last week has seen a bustle of activity in Imperial space. Senator Torval went head to head with Aisling Duval to prove once and for all that Imperial Slavery is here to stay. Aisling's Angels did the best they could to support the people's princess, freeing an astonishing 1,149,756 Imperial Slaves in the span of just one week. Unfortunately for the diva Duval, the Imperial Slavers Association managed to acquire a staggering 2,387,567 Unregulated Slaves in the same space of time. The Unregulated Slaves are currently undergoing an intensive ISA-certified retraining regime. The graduates of which are expected to go on sale from Lagerkvist Gateway next weekend. Princess Arissa has been making her presence felt by shining a light on the darker corners of the Empire. Thousands of criminals have been apprehended by Commanders working on behalf of Arissa, although sadly only a handful of them have been able to provide any clues as to who ordered the attack on the Emperor. The Princess will announce what new information has come to light once her Imperial courtiers have finished with their current investigation. Finally, Senator Patreus has reached a new financial agreement with Themiscrya, a system that owes the Senator a sizeable debt due to loans taken out by the current government before they came to power. In less pleasant news, Silver Universal PLC (the Senator's financial services subsidiary) has announced that from next week it will be raising interest rates on all outstanding debts owed to the Senator.^[7]^

08 MAR 3301

- The Future of Synteini party is calling on all Commanders to protest the actions of the Imperial Slavers Association in the Synteini system. "Today marks the anniversary of the 'Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves', one of two acts that helped end the Atlantic slave trade in the early 19th century," said a party representative. "And now a new slaving facility is opening up in our own backyard?" The party offers their own station as a potential solution. "The Future of Synteini party will not abide by slavery, Imperial or no. I make the call to commanders: give your business to the Future of Synteini, not to the ISA. Do business at William Sargent, and starve Lagerkvist. Let's hit Senator Zemina Torval where it counts - and kick her out of Synteini!" Lagerkvist Gateway orbits the second planet in the Synteini A system, while William Sargent Vision orbits the fourth.

01 MAR 3301

- The Imperial Slavers Association, in conjunction with Senator Zemina Torval, is pleased to announce the official opening of the newest ISA slave training facility aboard Lagerkvist Gateway in the Synteini system. The facility, which includes state of the art skill implantation terminals and body sculpting shops, is already set to become one of the premier Imperial Slave training academies anywhere in Imperial space. Commander Barham of the Imperial Slavers Association had this to say about the new centre: "It really is a marvel of modern technology. We have some of the best trainers, working with the very best materials that credits can buy. We have no doubt that this facility will stand as a shining example to the rest of the galaxy as to how to get your unregulated workforce up to an appropriately imperial standard."^[1]^
