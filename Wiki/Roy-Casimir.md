Holloway Bioscience Institute chief researcher

Dr. **Roy Casimir** is the chief researcher of the Holloway Bioscience Institute. He has directed a number of research projects focused on the study of space-dwelling lifeforms found in Notable Stellar Phenomena across the galaxy.

## Timeline

14 JAN 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
The Holloway Bioscience Institute has rewarded pilots who delivered living matter extracted from space-dwelling organisms. Many shipments of seed pod tissue samples arrived at Jaques Station, from where they will be transported to the Holloway Biology Centre on Colonia 7 G. These will be used to replenish stocks used in the facility's experimentation programme. Dr Roy Casimir, chief researcher at the centre, expressed his gratitude: "These vital supplies mean that we can resume our studies on the incredible organisms that float through the void. Here at Holloway we're making many breakthroughs in the field of xenobiology, some with intriguing commercial possibilities." The Holloway Bioscience Institute now plans to establish experimental habitats for vacuum lifeforms in the following systems:
Eol Prou PC-K c9-221
Eol Prou LW-L c8-99
Eol Prou KW-L c8-301
Eol Prou PC-K c9-154
Pilots who contributed to this initiative can now collect their rewards from Jacques Station in the Colonia system.^[1]^

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
The Holloway Bioscience Institute in Colonia is offering high payouts for delivering samples from space-dwelling lifeforms. The Holloway Biology Centre on Colonia 7 G is the organisation's primary research laboratory, which specialises in xenological studies. Jaques Station, which is also in the Colonia system, has agreed to serve as the delivery point for this initiative. Chief researcher Dr Roy Casimir outlined the requirements: "There is still a huge amount to learn about the fascinating structures that grow within the vacuum of space. As our stock of specimens is running low, we require fresh tissue samples from living organisms to continue our experimentation programme. I appreciate that our facility is located a considerable distance from the core systems, but we're willing to offer generous reimbursement for those who make the journey." Pilots are requested to extract any type of tissue sample, including pod mesoglea, from any type of seed pod. These are to be delivered to Jaques Station in the Colonia system.^[2]^

11 DEC 3305

- Following months of setbacks, the Holloway Biology Centre has finally opened in the Colonia system. The research centre will focus on the study of newly catalogued lifeforms. Dr Roy Casimir, chief researcher at the Holloway Bioscience Institute, held a press conference at the opening ceremony, and discussed the delays that followed a successful campaign to found the centre in February this year: "Our study of the lifeforms discovered over the past year formed the basis of the research centre's designs. As the volume of scans provided by the galactic community continued to grow, it became apparent that we lacked the laboratory space required to study it all. As a result, the Holloway Bioscience Institute committed to several months of investment and redesign, to ensure that a wide variety of material could be analysed. We are confident that this decision will prove more than worthwhile, and our scientists are excited to work in this state-of-the-art facility." The Holloway Biology Centre is located in the Colonia system on Colonia 7 G.^[3]^

14 FEB 3305

- A campaign from the Holloway Bioscience Institute to build a xenological research centre has concluded successfully. Chief researcher Dr Roy Casimir told the media: "Thanks to Nahuaru Crimson Bridge Int we now have sufficient materials to build a planetary outpost where our scientists can study lifeforms identified by the galactic community. We are also grateful for the exploration data provided by many pilots, which will help us create a new research catalogue." Pilots who took part in the campaign can now collect their rewards from Williams Vision in the Nahuaru system.^[4]^

07 FEB 3305

- Dr Roy Casimir of the Holloway Bioscience Institute has announced plans to construct a research centre focusing on new life forms discovered by the galactic community: "The development of the Codex has led to a number of xenological discoveries. Our aim is to construct a dedicated scientific facility to analyse these incredible lifeforms. We therefore request quantities of Cobalt, Indium and Tantalum to be delivered to Williams Vision in the Nahuaru system. In addition, we ask pilots to provide us with exploration data, which will form the core of our xenological research catalogue. Nahuaru Crimson Bridge Int has agreed to fund the initiative and reimburse contributing pilots." The initiative begins on the 7th of February 3305 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.^[5]^
