## Overview

The Karma C-44 excels as a reliable short-range weapon. Though its range and DPS are inferior to the AR-50, its higher rate of fire, magazine size, reserve ammo capacity, and short range accuracy make it a very capable firearm. 

Unlike most other primary weapons, the C-44 does not incur a movement speed penalty when held—this trait is especially useful when wearing the Maverick or Artemis suits, which lack heavy armor and must rely more on dodging fire than taking it.

As a kinetic weapon, the C-44 is more effective at dealing damage to unshielded targets.
