# Drive Strengthening
**Drive Strengthening** is an engineer modification that can be applied to Thrusters. It increases module integrity and decreases thermal load, at the cost of increased mass.

It is available in 5 grades, with the highest grade offering up to 110% increase in module integrity and up to 50% decrease in thermal load.
