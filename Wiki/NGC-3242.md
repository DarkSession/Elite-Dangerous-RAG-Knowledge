NGC 3242, Ghost of Jupiter
 		 	 

**NGC 3242**, aka Ghost of Jupiter, is a planetary nebula in the constellation Hydra, 1400 ly from Sol. The stellar remnant of a white dwarf is visible at the center of the nebula. When a star completes fusion in its core, it throws off its outer layers which creates a planetary nebula.^[1]^ It's also called Ghost of Jupiter for having a striking resemblance to Jupiter. William Herschel discovered the nebula on February 7, 1785.
