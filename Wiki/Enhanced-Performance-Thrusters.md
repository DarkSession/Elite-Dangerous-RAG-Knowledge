## Usage

Enhanced Performance Thrusters are powerful for their size, and in some cases can result in a 45% increase to a ship's top speed, but they have limited applications because there are only two available classes of the module and both only benefit small ships with lower total mass. Larger ships that attempt to equip the module will only see a decrease in overall speed as the Class 2 and 3-sized modules will be overwhelmed by the greater mass. While some pilots may install Enhanced Performance Thursters in small ships to boost their combat capability, they are also useful in some dedicated racing builds.

As of 2025-04-29, the following ships' thruster slot has a maximum size with an available Enhanced Performance Thruster:

- Eagle
- Imperial Eagle
- Imperial Courier
- Sidewinder MK I
- Viper MK III
