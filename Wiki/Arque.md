**Arque** is an Allied system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It became a member of the Alliance in 3278, and has since seen significant investment from the Wreaken Corporation. Professor Ishmael Palin, the Engineer and Thargoid expert, relocated his workshop to Arque following a Thargoid attack on his original facility in Maia in July 3305.^[1]^
