> The son of a freedom fighter killed defending his home system, Jude entered military service as soon as he was able to continue his family's struggle. Years of resistance in an under-equipped militia wore on him until injuries sustained in combat forced him to retire. Jude now puts his engineering talents to use for private clients, but is rumoured to send much of it to family and former comrades.
