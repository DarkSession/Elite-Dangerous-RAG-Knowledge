## Overview

The Exclusion Zone is marked by a yellow ring and appears at low-atmosphere planets, earth-like worlds etc. All ships are blocked from entering the exclusion zone which is usually at a 207 to 210 kilometers height from the planet surface. The exclusion zone causes a ship to perform an emergency drop with an approximately 30% temperature increase. Afterward, attempts to approach the planet with thrusters will stop the ship at 207 kilometers. The message "Body Exclusion Zone Hit" will appear in the HUD and the info log.

The Advanced Planetary Approach Suite enables pilots to bypass the Exclusion Zone and land on low-atmosphere planets. 

## Capital Ships

Most capital ships (Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser, Majestic-Class Interdictor) have a soft exclusion zone. Intruders are warned to back away. If a ship enters within 1 kilometer then all nearby authorities vessels will responds by attacking the intruder.
