# Discounts
**Discounts** on Ships and Modules are listed below. While most discounts are specific to a particular Station, some are offered throughout systems that fall under the control of certain Powers. Some discounts also apply only to specific ships or modules that may be out of stock at times depending on demand or which minor faction is in control of a given station.

Achieving an Elite rank in any field (Combat, Trading, Exploration, and CQC) unlocks a permanent 2.5% discount on all products galaxy-wide, which also stacks with other discounts.^[1]^
