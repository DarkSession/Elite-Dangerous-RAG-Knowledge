## History

Founded in 3100, Brewer Corporation has produced thousands of Coriolis Starports and countless weapons platforms for the defense of Outposts and Surface Ports. Its main fabrication plant is located in the Minerva system.^[2]^

### Introducing Fleet Carriers

In June 3306, Brewer Corporation debuted its first foray into shipbuilding: the Drake-Class Carrier.^[3]^ While the Drake quickly proved to be a successful product, customers expressed concerns that owners of large ships such as the Anaconda had reduced access to markets selling the Tritium fuel needed to power the vessels. In response, Brewer Corporation announced in September 3306 that it had partnered with the independent construction firms Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd and Steel Castle Inc to upgrade a number of refinery Outposts into Orbis and Coriolis Starports.^[4]^

### The Colonia Bridge project

In October 3307, Brewer Corporation announced the Colonia Bridge project, a three-phase initiative to enhance transportation infrastructure between Alcor in the Core Systems and Colonia in the Colonia Region. It partnered with the Colonia Council to subsidise the Colonia side of the project's operations.^[5]^ The first phase of the initiative, involving the construction of 30 Flight Operations Carrier Megaships to be deployed along the route to Colonia, was confirmed successful on October 14.^[6]^ The megaships began operations under the management of Brewer Corporation's subsidiary, Brewer Logistics, on October 28.^[1]^ The second phase began on November 4, 3307, and called for the construction of 26 more megaships to link the two Colonia Bridge segments put into place by phase one. To encourage participation from long-range traders and deep space explorers, Brewer Corporation offered modified Frame Shift Drives as bonus rewards on the condition that the campaign meet its goals.^[7]^ On November 11, the second phase also completed successfully, and the new megaships were expected to be in place by November 25.^[8]^

On November 19, the Tau Ceti Journal reported rumours that Brewer Corporation was making revisions to its plans for the Colonia Bridge project's third phase in response to the overwhelming participation rates in the first two phases. These rumours were bolstered by confirmation from an insider source that the corporation was manufacturing more modified Frame Shift Drives as incentives for phase three. It was noted that the Colonia Bridge had thus far been an unmitigated success for Brewer, defying some analysts' pessimistic predictions that the project was too large to complete alone and would financially destabilise the megacorporation.^[9]^ After the deployment of the phase two megaships, Brewer Corp announced on November 26 that phase three had been pushed to January 6, 3308. This final phase would seek to build starports at key points along the Colonia Bridge route to establish a series of permanent micro-communities, and would also increase Tritium supplies at Colonia Bridge ports, as existing quantities had proven insufficient for the needs of Fleet Carriers.^[10]^ Phase three began as scheduled, and sought to construct up to six starports along the established Alcor-Colonia route.^[11]^ All quotas for phase three were met in time for the phase's conclusion on January 13.^[12]^

The six new Ocellus starports were deployed on January 27. The following day, however, Brewer Corporation revealed that the Colonia Bridge project would be extended with a fourth phase. This extra leg of the project was necessary to finish construction of the six starports, which had been sent to their destinations in an incomplete form, and furnish them with a wider range of services for travellers.^[13]^

Phase four began on February 10, and introduced some changes to the project's format. Instead of a single week-long initiative, phase four involved four separate initiatives that would take place over four consecutive weeks. Each initiative would install a different set of services on the Colonia Bridge starports and offer different rewards. The first initiative added Universal Cartographics and Vista Genomics services to the starports, and rewarded generous sums of credits.^[14]^ The second initiative, which began on February 17, requested resources to add Pioneer Supplies, Crew Lounge, and Search and Rescue services, and rewarded white cockpit lights.^[15]^ The third initiative to add Material Trader, Bartender, and Mission Board services began on February 24, and rewarded white engine drive color modifications.^[16]^ The fourth initiative of phase four and final overall initiative of the Colonia Bridge project began on March 3, 3308. The last slate of services to implement included Outfitting, Shipyards, and Technology Brokers, and the rewards were pre-Engineered Power Plants and exploration-themed ship decals. As a token of gratitude to all the pilots who had contributed to the project, participants in any of Colonia Bridge's seven initiatives were also promised a Brewer Corporation ship decal.^[17]^

The fourth phase met all of its quotas by March 10, ending the Colonia Bridge project on a triumphant note. With the multi-month endeavour finally complete, Brewer Corporation CEO Madelyn Teague released a rare personal message extending her gratitude to all of the pilots who made the project possible.^[18]^

### Planetary survey initiative

Brewer Corporation announced a planetary survey initiative for pilots to scan locations around the core systems. CEO Madelyn Teague made an announcement from the newly deployed megaship Trailblazer Echo: *"Recent events have accelerated plans to explore a new age of system colonisation efforts. Brewer Corporation has proudly supported ambitious projects such as the Colonia Bridge, and worked with other corporations to improve and increase starports across the galaxy. Now we take another step forward in the continued march across the stars."* *"Universal Cartographics has partnered with us to collect, analyse and process the very latest exploration data, to help calibrate our metrics for optimal colonisation targets. Explorers who wish to contribute to the initiative can hand in exploration data to the Trailblazer Echo in the HIP 90578 system."*^[19]^

Newsfeeds were expecting one final press release from Brewer Corporation, but instead received a rare personal message from the company's CEO Madelyn Teague: "It gives me enormous pleasure to announce a triumphant end for this historic undertaking. I want to thank every single person whose hard work made this dream of mine a reality. The names of those pilots most dedicated to the project will soon be recorded on commemorative beacons in the Alcor and Colonia systems. All of us at Brewer Corporation feel a real sense of pride in the Colonia Bridge. For decades to come, these six starports and 56 megaships will boost trade, support exploration and serve as way-stations for travellers. They represent what can be achieved when so many of us share the same vision and work together in harmony." Pilots who delivered materials can now collect payment from Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. The top 75% of contributors for the past week can also collect their pre-engineered overcharged power plant modules on the 11th of March.^[18]^

03 MAR 3308

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
Delivery campaigns in the Alcor and Colonia systems will complete the six starports along the Colonia Bridge. Months of work on developing the transportation infrastructure between the core systems and the Colonia region are now coming to an end. Brewer Corporation's latest press release specified the requirements: "For this final week, we are asking pilots to deliver auto-fabricators, micro controllers and resonating separators to Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. These will allow us to install outfitting, shipyard and tech broker services, as we bring the starports to full operational status. There is also another opportunity to install Pioneer Supplies at Promium Relay, the bridge starport nearest to Colonia. Brewer Corporation is grateful to independent pilots for their dedication to constructing the Colonia Bridge. We are therefore pleased to offer various classes of pre-engineered, overcharged power plants as well as exploration decals to the top 75% of contributors to this concluding stage. Finally, this is the last chance for pilots to obtain a Brewer Corporation decal, which will be awarded to every contributor to any of the Colonia Bridge initiatives as a token of gratitude." The top ten contributors for each of the Colonia Bridge initiatives will have the opportunity to be named in tourist beacons that will commemorate the project's conclusion.^[17]^

24 FEB 3308

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
Further deliveries to Alcor and Colonia are required to add new facilities to the Colonia Bridge starports. The Colonia Bridge project is currently halfway through its final phase, which takes place over a four-week period. In the previous week, pilots supplied large quantities of performance enhancers, personal weapons and survival equipment. A press release from Brewer Corporation outlined the next stage: "Thanks to the hard work of many independent pilots, we have established a Pioneer Supplies outlet, a crew lounge and a search and rescue contact at the five starports along the travel corridor between the core systems and the Colonia region. For week three, our aim is to continue constructing the stations by installing a material trader, concourse bar and mission contract services. These will rely on shipments of computer components, liquor and water purifiers. For pilots who deliver these to Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system, Brewer Corporation will be pleased to offer a White Engine Drive Colour and a White Carrier Drive Colour alongside payment in credits." Once this week's initiative concludes, week four will aim to complete the Colonia Bridge starports with a full range of services.^[16]^

17 FEB 3308

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
Brewer Corporation has requested a new batch of deliveries to the Alcor and Colonia systems. The Colonia Bridge is comprised of 56 stationary megaships and six starports, providing facilities to travellers between the core systems and the Colonia region. However, the starports are still in a state of construction. The megacorp outlined its latest requirements in a press release: "Phase four of the Colonia Bridge project launched with a highly satisfactory first week. Shipments of coffee, emergency power cells, geological equipment and liquid oxygen arrived in sufficient numbers to ensure Universal Cartographics and Vista Genomics services were added to all six starports. The goal of the second week is to continue assembling the stations' infrastructure, and install Pioneer Supplies, Crew Lounge and Search and Rescue services. To achieve this, performance enhancers, personal weapons and survival equipment are needed in large quantities. Pilots are asked to provide these at Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. As well as guaranteeing generous reimbursements to all contributors, Brewer Corporation is pleased to offer warm, white cockpit lights as an additional token of gratitude." The third and fourth weeks of the project's final phase will focus on adding further services on the Colonia Bridge starports to accommodate all pilot professions.^[15]^

10 FEB 3308

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
Deliveries have been requested in the Alcor and Colonia systems to implement services to the Colonia Bridge starports. A press release from Brewer Corporation provided the details: "The fourth and final phase of our Colonia Bridge project will take place over the next four weeks. Our goal is to finish constructing the starports that were recently added to the route between the Colonia and Alcor systems. For the first week, we require deliveries of Coffee, Emergency Power Cells, Geological Equipment and Liquid Oxygen to Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. If we receive sufficient commodities, we can add Universal Cartographics and Vista Genomics to all six stations. Everyone at Brewer Corporation was impressed by the galactic community's dedication to improving the travel corridor to the Colonia region. For this week's initiative, contributing pilots have the opportunity to be rewarded with a generous number of credits. In subsequent weeks, we will be offering a variety of additional rewards. Following feedback from our shareholders, we also plan to install beacons to recognise the major contributors to all phases of the Colonia Bridge project. The top ten contributors of every past and upcoming Colonia Bridge initiative will be listed on these beacons to immortalise the names of these pilots." The Colonia Bridge starports currently offer rearm, refuel and repair services as well as basic commodity trading. The second, third and fourth weeks of this phase will focus on adding further services.^[14]^

28 JAN 3308

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
The infrastructures of six starports have been completed along the travel corridor between Colonia and the core systems. Brewer Corporation has confirmed that five starport frames were constructed in systems branching out from Alcor, with a sixth closer to the Colonia system. The new stations are:
Zerreiss Station in the Pru Euq WO-D b53-8 system
Helgrind Gateway in the NGC 6530 Sector ZE-X b2-0 system
Vladmir McDoogle's Triumph in the Flyiedge VN-W c4-51 system
Canonn Complex in the Prua Phoe MI-B b17-5 system
Venatores Hub in the Blua Eaec WW-E c14-1293 system
Promium Relay in the Eoch Flyuae QK-E d12-2118 system
At present the starports are not fully operational and only provide rearm, refuel and repair services. Basic commodity trading has also been established to accommodate pilots selling construction materials and to supply tritium fuel. A fourth phase of the Colonia Bridge project is scheduled to begin on the 10th of February, which will aim to complete construction and add a broader range of facilities. Brewer Corporation was able to meet all of its targets for phase three due to the considerable amount of raw materials delivered by the galactic community. The names of the new starports were selected by those pilots who made the greatest contributions to the initiative.^[13]^

13 JAN 3308

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
The third phase of Brewer Corporation's Colonia Bridge project has proven successful, according to a recent announcement. Shipments of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units were transported in large numbers to Jaques Station in the Colonia system and Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system. As a result, several new starports will be constructed along the travel corridor to Colonia. Brewer Corporation released this statement regarding the initiative: "Once again, we owe a great deal to the pilots who brought us so many vital resources. We can now proceed with constructing one starport in the vicinity of Colonia and 5 starports in systems branching out from Alcor. These will increase the value of the Colonia Bridge for travellers, tourists and commercial interests alike. The starport infrastructures are scheduled to be built by the 27th of January. Initially they will provide rearm, refuel and repair services, but will lack markets and other facilities. The distances involved in ferrying equipment to these locations means that these starports will become fully operational in stages over a period of weeks. Contributors will be able to collect their rewards from Jaques Station and Macdonald Settlement from the 14th of January. The proposed engineered frame shift drives for those eligible will follow at a later date. The dedicated pilots who provided the most deliveries in Alcor and Colonia will receive invitations to submit suggestions to name the new starports, subject to review."^[12]^

06 JAN 3308

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
Brewer Corporation intends to improve the travel corridor between the Alcor and Colonia systems by constructing several new starports. The previous two phases of the Colonia Bridge project established stationary megaships in 56 systems. These provide rest, refuel and repair facilities for vessels making the 22,000 light year journey to and from the Colonia region. The additional infrastructure has also increased the amount of tritium available at these markets, easing the journey for capital-size ships. A press release from Brewer Corporation outlined this latest initiative: "Phase three aims to enhance the Colonia Bridge by building permanent starports in key locations along the route. These will offer a wide range of services to travellers, and also serve as homes for the many new communities that we expect to spring up around them. Our plan is to construct one starport in the vicinity of Colonia, and up to five starports stretching out from Alcor. Station structures will be assembled by the 27th of January, with additional services scheduled for implementation at a later date. Pilots are asked to deliver ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units to Jaques Station in the Colonia system and Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system. Assuming deliveries reach the required level, engineered frame shift drives will once again be available as rewards. The highest contributor in Colonia, and up to the top five contributors in Alcor, will be invited to submit naming suggestions for the new starports. All name submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors."^[11]^

31 DEC 3307

- The last in a series that reviews the events of the past year, by noted historian Sima Kalhana.
"October brought further controversy for the Federation, when a diplomatic conference in the Delta Pavonis system was revealed to be a honey trap designed to capture Yuri Grom. Only a rush of support for EG Union allowed their ruler to escape, causing political embarrassment for President Hudson. There was more corporate drama when Zemina Torval relinquished her long-held majority sharehold of Mastopolos Mining, fuelling rumours of a family rift with her cousins. Torval Mining Ltd became a fully independent corporation run by her daughter Constantia. The Colonia Bridge project officially started the first of two phases this year which would see the construction of 56 megaships between the Alcor and Colonia systems. Brewer Corporation enjoyed great public support for improving this travel corridor along the 22,000 light year journey, and revealed plans to enhance it further in the new year. Hadrian Duval, his wife Lady Astrid and their unborn child were the specific targets of another starport bombing by the NMLA. It proved unsuccessful, but did result in the Imperial Senate offering them protection in order to secure the Duval bloodline. It also led to a manhunt for Theta Seven, the galaxy's most wanted terrorist. In November, Orion University claimed that the dredger occupied by the Scriveners Clan was legally their property, but the nomadic descendants of its original crew refused to give up their home. The stand-off caught the public attention, with some supporting the clan's right to independence and others keen to discover what their Knowledge Core contained. Ultimately the Scriveners retained their freedom, sailing off into the void with their secrets intact. Many were shocked when Admiral Tanner, Aegis's military chief, went rogue and tried to force access to a starport controlled by Salvation's allies. His conviction that the anti-xeno superweapons were responsible for provoking the Thargoids was, however, not enough to win the day. The NMLA threw everything they had at the Mudhrid system in an attempt to rescue Theta Seven, who was hiding among the Far God cult to avoid capture. But the terrorists were crushed by ACT and a coalition of ships, with Theta Seven martyring himself by destroying the hijacked megaship Sacrosanct. A happier event in December was the birth of Hector Duval, son and heir of Hadrian and Lady Astrid. There were celebrations across the Empire, but also questions asked about the future of the Duval dynasty and if the child might one day inherit the Imperial throne. The year ended as it had begun, with Thargoid vessels swarming into nebula systems. But with incursions steadily increasing over recent months, there were fears that this time they might prove unstoppable. Salvation's superweapons were once again deployed to halt the aliens' progress, but will they be enough to prevent the Thargoids from threatening humanity in 3308?"^[20]^

26 NOV 3307

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
The second phase of the Colonia Bridge project is complete, with Brewer Corporation confirming details for phase three. An additional 26 megaships have taken up stationary positions in systems between Alcor and Colonia. Along with the existing 30 megaships, these will provide convenient rest, refuel and repair facilities to those travelling to and from the distant Colonia region. A press release from Brewer Corporation addressed the next steps: "The galactic community has made enormous contributions to establishing the Colonia Bridge. Encouraged by this, we have revised our plans and increased investment in the project. The next phase is scheduled to commence on the 6th of January 3308, and will add starports to key locations along the route. These will provide further services and opportunities to pilots, as well as forming permanent micro-communities between the core systems and Colonia. Phase three will also address the availability of tritium, to improve refuelling capacity for owners of our Drake-class fleet carriers. To incentivise the delivery of vital materials, we will be offering the same engineered frame shift drives that proved so popular during phase two."^[10]^

19 NOV 3307

- Brewer Corporation is enhancing the travel corridor to Colonia, but details about the project's next phase remain uncertain. Business-related newsfeed The Tau Ceti Journal published this feature: "There's no doubt that Brewer Corporation always thinks big. It has enjoyed huge commercial success as a manufacturer of starports and outposts, and its Drake-class fleet carrier has been enormously popular. The Colonia Bridge is the megacorp's most expensive undertaking yet, investing hundreds of billions of credits on the transportation infrastructure between the core systems and Colonia. More than one analyst predicted that the project might financially destabilise them. The first two phases proceeded on schedule. Before the end of this month, there will be a chain of 56 stationary megaships along systems between Alcor and Colonia. But there are rumours of a change of plans for phase three, which may be early next year. It is believed that Brewer Corporation is revising its plans based on the unexpectedly high levels of participation from the galactic community. In support of this, one company insider did reveal that more engineered frame shift drives are being manufactured, to be offered as incentives to contributing pilots in the third phase."^[9]^

11 NOV 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Successful campaigns in the Alcor and Colonia systems will result in new megaships being added to the Colonia Bridge. Large quantities of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units were provided at either end of the route between the core systems and the distant Colonia region. Brewer Corporation provided an update on the project: "Once again, the galactic community has provided the vital materials required to construct dockable megaships. These additional ports should be operational by the 25th of November, making journeys to and from Colonia easier and safer. Pilots can now collect their rewards from Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. We shall also be awarding an engineered frame shift drive with long range and fast boot to the majority of contributors." The top ten pilots who delivered materials to Alcor and Colonia will shortly be invited to submit suggestions to name the new megaships. Submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors. To ensure a variety of choice, only pilots who have not yet submitted names for the Colonia Bridge megaships will be eligible.^[8]^

04 NOV 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Brewer Corporation requests deliveries in the Alcor and Colonia systems for the next phase of the Colonia Bridge project. A successful initiative in October resulted in the placement of 30 dockable megaships at intervals of several hundred light years, providing services such as refuelling and repairs. The second phase seeks to establish this support for the full route between the core systems and the Colonia region. A press release from Brewer Corporation stated: "We are now ready to continue work on the Colonia Bridge, by constructing additional megaships to fill the middle of the planned route. As before, we require shipments of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units at Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system or Jaques Station in the Colonia system. Should deliveries reach sufficient levels, the top 75% of contributors will be awarded an engineered frame shift drive with increased range and faster boot sequence. Our hope is that this encourages deep space explorers and long-distance haulers to take part in the Colonia Bridge project." As an additional reward, the top ten contributors at Alcor and Colonia will be invited to submit naming suggestions for the new megaships. Submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors. To ensure a variety of choice, only pilots who have not yet submitted names for the Colonia Bridge megaships will be eligible.^[7]^

29 OCT 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Thirty megaships have been placed between the core systems and the Colonia region to serve as stationary ports. Twenty-five dockable megaships were sent out from the Alcor system toward Colonia, taking position in systems approximately 400 to 500 light years apart. Five further megaships have been established from the direction of the Colonia system. Each vessel serves as a permanent way station for travellers and businesses, designed to improve the journey to and from Colonia. A variety of services are provided, including tritium refuelling for Drake-class fleet carriers. The Colonia Bridge is the product of Brewer Corporation, which ran a highly successful deliveries campaign to collect resources. The megacorp has confirmed that phase two of this project will commence next week. During the creation of the Colonia Bridge, the crew aboard the stationary megaship Memories of Oresrati in the Snake Sector OD-S b4-2 system reported an unusual incident. A distorted transmission that could have been an SOS was detected on long-range sensors. Although they were unable to triangulate its source, the signal strength suggested a point of origin within 50 light years.^[1]^

14 OCT 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Twin initiatives in the Alcor and Colonia systems have procured materials to construct new dockable megaships. Brewer Corporation made an announcement regarding its Colonia Bridge project: "A positive response has led to generous shipments of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units being received. As a result, Brewer Corporation can now commence work on enhancing the transportation infrastructure between the core systems and the Colonia region. Thanks to the dedication of the galactic community, 30 dockable megaships will be placed along the Colonia Bridge route by the 28th of October. These will serve as stationary ports, providing vital facilities for travellers. Planning is already underway for the second phase of this project, placing further megaships every four to five hundred light years working out from the Alcor and Colonia systems. Payment for contributing pilots is now available at Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. Both starports also offer a temporary discount on purchasing and outfitting to owners of our Drake-class Carriers." Brewer Corporation will soon be reaching out to the top ten pilots from both the Alcor and Colonia initiatives, to provide naming suggestions for the dockable megaships being placed on the route to Colonia. Submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors.^[6]^

07 OCT 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Delivery campaigns in the Alcor and Colonia systems aim to improve journeys to the distant colonies. The Colonia Bridge project is being funded by Brewer Corporation, which outlined the details in a press release: "The Colonia region has great potential for businesses and travellers, but the long voyage can be prohibitive. Brewer Corporation is investing in the transportation infrastructure between the core systems and Colonia, to make crossing those thousands of light years easier. Up to 30 dockable megaships will be placed along the route to Colonia, providing travellers with valuable respite and resources including tritium. These stationary megaships should be operational by the 28th of October, and will mark the completion of the first phase of the three-phase Colonia Bridge project. Its aim is to place dockable megaships every four to five hundred light years working out from the Alcor and Colonia systems. To achieve this, we require large quantities of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units. These can be delivered to either Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system or Jaques Station in the Colonia system." The Colonia Council is subsidising part of the initiative, due to the importance of this enterprise. As a consequence, the commodity requirements for the megaships at Jaques Station are reduced. Brewer Corporation has confirmed that as well as offering payment for the materials, it will ask the top ten contributors at Alcor and Colonia to submit potential names for the new megaships. Submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors. As an added incentive, there will be temporary discounts on purchasing and outfitting fleet carriers at both Macdonald Settlement and Jacques Station, based on pilots' contributions.^[5]^

11 SEP 3306

- A press release from Brewer Corporation discusses plans to improve access to refuelling for owners of fleet carriers. "We have been surprised and gratified by the popularity of our latest product. The options for independent pilots and crews have been considerably expanded by the versatility and capability of our Drake-Class Carriers. But we have also listened to customers' concerns, in particular that large ships such as Anacondas, Corvettes and Clippers cannot dock with refinery outposts to take on Tritium fuel. To help alleviate this issue, Brewer Corporation has partnered with two independent construction firms: Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd and Steel Castle Inc. They are tasked with upgrading a number of outposts into fully functioning starports, in order to make refuelling runs more efficient." The two construction companies that won this contract both have impressive track records in modifying orbital habitats. Kavanagh Spaceframes specialises in Orbis starports, while Steel Castle exclusively works with Coriolis designs. The projects are expected to begin next week.^[4]^

12 NOV 3301

- Two weeks ago, the Explorers' Association began work on a new Ocellus starport in the Pleiades Nebula. The project received financial support from the Brewer Corporation and Universal Cartographics, which offered generous premiums to traders providing essential materials for the construction. Now, with the bulk of the work complete, the Explorer's Association has announced a third and final appeal for resources: "Thanks to the hard work and dedication of the galactic community, the new Ocellus starport is almost complete, and we are a hair's breadth from gaining an important foothold in the Pleiades Nebula. All that's needed now is one final push. If you are in a position to help, we implore you to do so. This is your last chance to be a part of this historic project." Pilots who want to contribute to the campaign are invited to deliver Computer Components to Neville Horizons in the Kaushpoos system.^[21]^

22 OCT 3301

- For the past few months, a development group founded by the Explorer's Association has been working on plans to build a starport in the Pleiades Nebula. Now, it appears the plans are about to become reality. A spokesperson from the Explorer's Association made the following statement: "A starport in the Pleiades Nebula would be of tremendous value to pilots, serving as a reliable resupply point and sanctuary in the depths of space. But breaking into deep space is always costly, not to mention potentially dangerous. Fortunately we have received generous support from the Brewer Corporation, Pacap Limited and Universal Cartographics, and are now in a position to begin construction. The first phase of the project involves collecting the necessary materials to create the starport superstructure, and to this end we are willing to offer generous premiums to pilots delivering metals to Neville Horizons, our base of operations. I encourage all those with an interest in exploration to join this exciting project, and contribute to the next phase of humankind's expansion." One of the pilots involved in the programme was quoted as saying: "Hopefully, getting a station farther out into uninhabited space will be the first step towards human expansion out into the wider reaches of the galaxy." Pilots who wish to contribute to the campaign should deliver metals to Neville Horizons in the Kaushpoos system.^[22]^

## Notes

- Brewer Corporation has an associated minor faction, Brewer Logistics, which controls the Megaships and Starports built by the Colonia Bridge project.
