The **AX Missile Rack** is a dumbfire missile rack created by Liz Ryder for Aegis. Released on September 28, 3303, the AX Missile Rack is capable of penetrating the Thargoid Interceptor's resistance to normal weapons and damaging them. Combined with the AX Multi-cannon, the AX Missile Rack can be used to expose Thargoid Hearts on Interceptors for the cannon to damage. Class 2 versions can be purchased at military, high-tech, and industrial planetary bases, while class 3 versions can be purchased only at military planetary bases.

The AX Missile Rack is designed primarily for combat against Thargoid ships, and consequently deals less damage against conventional human ships than a standard Missile Rack. Unlike the latter, AX Missile Racks cannot be engineered.

## Pre-engineered Sirius AX Missile Racks

A double pre-engineered version of the AX Missile Racks with High Capacity and Rapid Fire was made available by Sirius Corporation after the Community Goal of 29 Nov. 3308, in fixed mode only for both Class 2 and 3. The Sirius AX Missile Racks can be unlocked at a Technology Broker on one of the Sirius Megaships in exchange of the following materials (cost to unlock **a single module**):

**Class 2** **(fixed)**:

- 12 Mechanical Equipment
- 6 Heat Dispersion Plate
- 8 Vanadium
- 5 High Density Composites
- 5 Military Supercapacitors

**Class 3 (fixed)**:

- 20 Mechanical Equipment
- 9 Heat Dispersion Plate
- 13 Vanadium
- 10 High Density Composites
- 10 Military Supercapacitors
- 3 Technetium

Compared to the regular variant, the Sirius-modified AX Missile Racks offer:

- +100% ammo clip size and maximum ammo
- +42.9% rate of fire
- -45% reload time
- -20% distributor draw

at the cost of:

- -3% damage
- +70% mass
- +20% power draw
- +0.5-degree jitter

All these modifications lead to an overall increase of +38.2% in DPS compared to the non-engineered version, and +35.6% compared to the fixed Enhanced AX Missile Racks. This coupled with their increased ammo capacity make the Sirius AX Missile Racks the recommended weapon to hunt Orthrus Thargoid Interceptors down.
