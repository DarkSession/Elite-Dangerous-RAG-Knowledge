Bacterium Alcyoneum - Green
 		 	 

> 
> 
> True unicellular extremophiles capable of living in the full spectrum of temperatures, chemical soups and atmospheres. They form a kaleidoscopic range of patterns and colours based on their method of metabolism. They derive energy from photosynthetic, chemosynthetic or thermosynthetic processes. There are believed to be the precursors for many life forms, and are often found in conjunction with other species. Links between the biochemistry of bacterial colonies and neighbouring organisms are likely but as yet unproven.

## Description

Bacteria appear as pattered mats at close range, but look like dark puddles from ~200m away. They do not protrude above the terrain and hence are not illuminated by Night Vision. They appear on flat ground: most commonly next to craters, but also in the middle of plains and hilly terrain.^[1]^

## Tips

Bacterium can be very hard to find, as it tends to blend into the terrain. A good trick is to use the free cam on an SRV to get a bird's-eye view of the area while driving, and patches of Bacterium should stick out like a sore thumb. Searching at night is not recommended.

## Notes

- Bacterium were introduced in *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*.

## Trivia

- On Earth, many types of microbes from microbial mats similar to this alien organism. These mats are communities formed from several types of microbes.
