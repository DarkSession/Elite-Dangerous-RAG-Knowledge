> The Federal Gunship is a tougher, more powerful version of its sibling, the Federal Dropship. With a total of seven hardpoints, the Gunship boasts a stronger combat profile than the Dropship, while its superior armour allows it to soak up more punishment. It may be slower and less agile than the Dropship, but this is by design - the Gunship has been created to dominate other ships, rather than outpace or outmanoeuvre them.

The **Federal Gunship** is a ship produced by Core Dynamics for the Federation. Purchasing it requires achieving a Federal Navy rank of Ensign. An upgraded variant of the Federal Dropship and Federal Assault Ship, the Federal Gunship sacrifices overall manoeuvrability for added firepower, very high armour for its size and cost, and the ability to carry a Fighter Hangar.

## Overview

The Federal Gunship is very heavily armoured and armed, possessing a total of seven weapon hardpoints. It has four utility mounts, and is one of four medium-sized ships capable of equipping a Fighter Hangar, alongside the Keelback, the Alliance Crusader and the Krait Mk II. It can inflict potentially devastating damage on a target, provided the pilot can keep the target pinned down long enough.

The Federal Gunship's manoeuvrability is below average, but by no means terrible. While its pitch rate is low, its yaw rate is considerably higher than other medium sized ships. Combining pitching and yawing while maneuvering allows the Gunship to be roughly as agile as the Python. The Gunship does suffer in terms of speed, as it is the slowest medium-sized ship and one of the slowest ships overall. Its low speed and powerful reverse thrusters does allow the Gunship to stop on a dime, unlike many heavy ships that require long breaking distances.

It features a Class 6 Power Plant and a relatively large Class 7 Power Distributor, but the Class 5 Frame Shift Drive is insufficient for the Gunship's mass and size, which gives it one of the shortest jump ranges of all ships. Internal compartments are large, but few in number: with just five compartments in total, outfitting options are restricted compared to the Federal Assault Ship and the Federal Dropship. This drawback of limited internal compartments has been partially offset by the addition of three Military Compartments.

Federal Gunship hardpoint convergence
 		 	 

The Federal Gunship's weapon hardpoints are located as follows: one Class 3 and two Class 2 hardpoints on the underside of the ship about a third of the length from the front; two additional Class 2 hardpoints in the bumpers on either side of the cockpit; and two Class 1 hardpoints on top of the ship next to the heat vents. The primary pilot's seat is set along the centerline of the vessel, and the secondary Multicrew pilot seat lies behind and above it, with an offset to the left.
