### Thargoid War Bulletin: Titan Destroyed

Titan Taranis, one of the eight Thargoid motherships, is presumed destroyed after a concerted attack using Guardian nanite torpedoes.

The journalist Jade Sanderlyn published a bulletin via Vox Galactica:

“*We’re receiving incredible news from the Hyades Sector FB-N b7-6 system, where independent pilots were supporting Aegis’s assaults against the Titans. The new Guardian nanite torpedoes have proved effective against the Titans’ thermal vents, forcing their hulls to open and vent internal heat. And that has allowed Commanders to target the core of each gigantic ship*.”

“*What were believed to be Taranis’s death throes were closely observed. A massive release of energy repulsed all ships, followed by further explosions. At present the Titan’s status cannot be verified, due to an intensely corrosive gas cloud that prevents ships from approaching. Aegis is confident, however, that the detonations were fatal*.”

“*It’s too early to analyse what this means for the ongoing Thargoid war. But this looks like a significant victory, proving that these giants can be toppled after all. As attacks continue against the seven remaining Titans, we will follow these developments closely*.”

### Titan Taranis destruction yields extensive data for research projects

The recent destruction of Titan Taranis has yielded a significant amount of data that scientists across the galaxy have begun interrogating.

Science correspondent Leon Banerjee summarised for Vox Galactica:

“*Research on Titans has been ongoing since their first appearance, and understanding how they function has been considered crucial to humanity’s survival in the Thargoid war*.”

“*I have spent time with everyone from the smallest private research bodies to the largest corporations in the past few years, and the common anxiety amongst the scientific community is still how little we truly understand about the Titans*.”

“*What answers does the caustic remnant of Taranis contain? What might have survived the destruction? When the wreckage is safe enough to enter, the additional data to be found there will doubtless benefit humanity in some form*.”

### The Assault on Leigong

**\*Pilots’ Federation Alert\***

Titan Leigong is under siege. This is an urgent call to all independent pilots to aid in the complete defeat of a second Titan.

The key modules for the assault continue to be readily available at all Rescue Megaships:

• Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser – To break through the maelstrom defence wave.

• Caustic Sink Launchers – To protect your ship from caustic effects of the maelstrom.

• Guardian Nanite Torpedo Pylon – To hamper the Titan’s vents and make it vulnerable to damage.

Rewards have been requisitioned for all Commanders able to participate in ending the Titan threat.

Good luck, Commanders.

### Thargoid War Bulletin: Second Titan Defeated

Titan Leigong in the HIP 8887 system has been eliminated, following the same tactical approach used against Taranis.

Vox Galactica’s Jade Sanderlyn reported:

“*Two of the eight Thargoid Titans have now been put out of action. Leigong suffered the same fate as Taranis, with its core being targeted by a sustained bombardment*.”

“*Aegis is overjoyed at these results. Both Professor Palin and Ram Tah are being praised for their development of the Guardian nanite torpedo, which is crucial to these attacks. And word is spreading that the Thargoid war machine has suffered a critical defeat, one that may change the entire conflict. Can these victories be repeated a further six times?*”

### Achilles Aerospace urges pilots to plunder Titan wreckage

Intense investment into research on Titan travel has been announced by the aerospace subdivision of the famed robotics company.

Their research has been centred on the method used by the Thargoid Titans to travel at speeds well beyond that of humanity’s current technological capacity.

A spokesperson for Achilles Aerospace had this to say:

“*For so long now, the means of space travel have been controlled by one company in a strict monopoly. Under that monopoly, progress seems to have stagnated entirely. But Achilles is a corporation built on the iteration and refinement of technology, and we intend to bring space travel into a new age*.”

“*We have been limited to observational data alone so far, but that is no longer the case. The remnant of Taranis is now accessible, and within it lies the missing component to our work. We urge pilots to venture to the wreckage of the destroyed Titan and try to obtain one of the rare Titan Drive Components. Achilles Aerospace will pay generously for any that are sold to Bloch Station in the Ethgreze system.” Experts warn that the Taranis site remains extremely dangerous. Caustic sinks should be equipped, and care should be taken due to reports of Thargoid ships active in the area*.
