## Datamined

This is a datamined description from the *ED: Odyssey* alpha: *"the Panther Clipper LX is one of the largest ships likely to be owned by a private individual. It is also the largest ship that will fit in the internal docking bays of space stations. Piloting one requires real skill. Its cargo carrying capacity is massive, although like most transport ships it is lightly armed and poorly armoured."*^[2]^

A 2021 leaked image shows it's manufactured by Gutamaya.^[3]^ However, the Panther Clipper Mk II is made by Zorgon Peterson.

## Development

The Panther Clipper LX was first shown in ED Newsletter #7 as a render of the model's blockout mesh and a grey-box animation on a landing pad.^[4]^ The earliest concept art (a paintover of the mesh) was shown in Newsletter #13. It was called "a trading workhorse".

The Panther Clipper LX was announced as planned content for *ED: Horizons*, but was never implemented despite appearing in *Horizons* concept art. Mentions of the Panther have been datamined from the game for years, and were most recently seen in the files of the *ED: Odyssey* alpha.^[2]^

On 30 April 2025, the Panther Clipper Mk II was unveiled during a Frontier Unlocked episode.
