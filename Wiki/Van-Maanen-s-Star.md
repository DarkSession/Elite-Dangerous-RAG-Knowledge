**Van Maanen's Star** is an independent system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. The system is permit-locked, and the permit can be obtained by becoming Allied with the Sublime Order of van Maanen's Star minor faction in any system where it has a presence.

The Sublime Order of van Maanen's Star faction was one of 14 permit-holding factions that entered into an agreement on November 24, 3307 to maintain so-called Gatekeeper megaships to preserve interstellar trade regardless of local political shifts. These Gatekeeper megaships would be permanently stationed in systems adjacent to their corresponding permit-locked systems to ensure that pilots could reliably obtain permits. Shadows Endurant was deployed in Epsilon Eridani as the Sublime Order of van Maanen's Star's Gatekeeper megaship.^[1]^
