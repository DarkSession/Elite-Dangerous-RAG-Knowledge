**Mind the Gap** was a community expedition organized by the Xbox One player group Deep Recon X. Its goal was to follow the final message transmitted by CMDR Salomé on August 23, 3304 as she was abducted by unidentified assailants in the Cemiess system, and search Hawking's Gap for sites related to Project Dynasty.^[1]^

## Background

In August 3302, a distress call was intercepted from Kahina Tijani Loren - a message for the legendary Children of Raxxla:

"Heavy fire...mayday! Imperial markings! Traitors... Shields are down, we're taking damage...it's... I thought I sensed his arrogance! How dare... We're being boarded. I only have moments. Please get word to the Children of Raxxla, tell them I have new information. The Rift, Hawkin's Gap and the Conflux are connected with strange happenings in the Pleiades. They must find out before..."

The repercussions of the message are sending ripples throughout occupied space, all at a time when alien objects and structures are being found with increasing regularity. Even unregistered beacons have been located in all three areas mentioned! These three areas of space are: The Formidine Rift, The Conflux and Hawking’s Gap – and it is the latter to which we must turn our attention.

This exploration mission launched just as the first Dynasty bases were being discovered. At the time of launch the Dynasty / Exodus storyline was unfolding and DRX attempted to be at the front of the search. In the event, they were pipped to the post, and continued a search of the wider Hawking's Gap area in case there were other items of interest.

The expedition was of note due to its unique search method where the group were split into two squadrons which went around the gap before meeting at the western end and returning through the centre.
