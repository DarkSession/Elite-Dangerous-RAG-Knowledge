**Asura** is an Independent system in the Colonia Region within the Inner Scutum-Centaurus Arm. It was originally colonised on June 26, 3303 by the minor faction Asura Industrial Complex, which constructed first Mizuno Dock and then Wellington's Claim a month later on July 26, 3303. The Engineer Petra Olmanova established her workshop, Sanctuary, in Asura on August 28, 3304.
