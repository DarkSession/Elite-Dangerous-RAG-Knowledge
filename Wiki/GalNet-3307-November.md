### Advocacy Defends Dredger Clan

The Scriveners Clan’s legal ownership of their dredger has been supported by the civil rights organisation Advocacy.

The ancient Dredger-class bulk cruiser, currently located in the Oochost PC-C c29-0 system, is inhabited by a nomadic tribe descended from the vessel’s original crew. Orion University claims that the cruiser is its commercial property, but has failed to make contact with its occupants.

Rhiannon Grady, director of Advocacy, explained:

“For centuries, there has been widespread legislation to protect remote communities from cultural contamination. These laws apply to micro-societies, such as those found aboard generation ships, that evolved in isolation.”

“Therefore, Orion University should not presume to deprive over ten thousand people of the only home they have ever known. Unlike cases such as the Golconda, which requested emergency assistance, in this case we are legally and morally obliged to respect the status quo.”

Professor Elizabeth Perez, head of anthropology at Orion University, responded:

“I was involved with the Golconda aid efforts, and fully appreciate the delicacy of this situation. But the dredger’s age and condition makes it a hazardous environment for its people. Evacuation should be considered for their own safety, with appropriate measures to minimise cultural disruption.”

The university’s megaship, Scientia Aeterna, has halted attempts to gain access to the Scriveners Clan dredger. However, it has not withdrawn its remote override of the vessel’s hyperdrive.

## 02 NOV

### Hadrian Duval Accepts Senate Protection

The Empire has officially proclaimed Hadrian Augustus Duval and his wife Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval to be wards of the Senate.

The offer of senatorial protection was made following an NMLA attempt to assassinate them and their unborn child by bombing Dyson City starport.

Prior to being transported from the Paresa system to a secure location, Hadrian Duval sent this message:

“Lady Astrid and I accepted this offer with enormous reluctance. Neither of us wish to abandon our home or loyal followers. Yet we feel it is a matter of duty to protect our family and ensure future generations of the Duval bloodline.”

“Nova Imperium will henceforth be known as Nova Paresa. It will continue to serve as a staunch ally of the Empire, as per the Treaty of Paresa. To all those who fought for our cause over the years, I assure you that history will never forget us. Memento Mordanticus!”

There has been public support for Praetor Leo Magnus to assume leadership of Nova Paresa. Hadrian Duval has endorsed his former head of security taking his place, but confirmed that the title of Imperator is now defunct.

In related news, ACT stated that its investigation into the Dyson City attack has yielded results. Although details remain embargoed for security reasons, a significant breakthrough is expected to be announced soon.

## 03 NOV

### Demands for Federal Rebellion Decline

Many factions have seceded from the Federation in recent months, but recent polls suggest the likelihood of further withdrawals is waning.

The Federal Times published an update on the situation by political correspondent Sofia Trevino:

“Some negative reaction to the Proactive Detection Bureau was anticipated. But it’s unlikely that Congress foresaw nearly forty systems abandoning the Federal Accord, as their governing factions declared independence.”

“Fears that this would spiral into mass rebellion now seem misplaced, however. This is partly thanks to the PDB’s recent role in preventing Jupiter’s Wrath from committing terrorist acts. Although that group is hardly in the NMLA’s league, evidence that communications surveillance can save lives seems to have convinced some Federal citizens to reconsider their opposition.”

“President Hudson’s efforts against the breakaway factions were hailed by his supporters and decried by his opponents. But the Federal Diplomatic Corps remain displeased that Hudson suffered no repercussions for violating diplomatic immunity when attempting to capture Yuri Grom.”

“Shadow President Winters continues to call for the PDB to be shut down to prevent the Federation from becoming an authoritarian police state. But many accuse her rhetoric on civil liberties to have triggered the secessions in the first place.”

“Meanwhile, many Federal factions are carefully observing those who did become independent. Their future success or failure may well determine whether or not this rebellion continues.”

### Colonia Bridge Project Enters Phase Two

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Brewer Corporation requests deliveries in the Alcor and Colonia systems for the next phase of the Colonia Bridge project.

A successful initiative in October resulted in the placement of 30 dockable megaships at intervals of several hundred light years, providing services such as refuelling and repairs. The second phase seeks to establish this support for the full route between the core systems and the Colonia region.

A press release from Brewer Corporation stated:

“We are now ready to continue work on the Colonia Bridge, by constructing additional megaships to fill the middle of the planned route. As before, we require shipments of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units at Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system or Jaques Station in the Colonia system.”

“Should deliveries reach sufficient levels, the top 75% of contributors will be awarded an engineered frame shift drive with increased range and faster boot sequence. Our hope is that this encourages deep space explorers and long-distance haulers to take part in the Colonia Bridge project.”

As an additional reward, the top ten contributors at Alcor and Colonia will be invited to submit naming suggestions for the new megaships. Submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors. To ensure a variety of choice, only pilots who have not yet submitted names for the Colonia Bridge megaships will be eligible.

## 05 NOV

### Aegis Leader Opposes Salvation

Admiral Aden Tanner has called for Aegis to reject the public inquiry’s shutdown and take direct action against Salvation.

The Musashi, an Aegis Defense megaship under his command, has entered the T Tauri system to challenge Taurus Mining Ventures. The corporation has performed activities on Salvation’s behalf, including preparation for the anti-xeno weapon used to eliminate all Thargoids from the Cornsar system.

Admiral Tanner transmitted this message to media outlets:

“Salvation’s unlicensed weapons technology is deliberately designed to provoke the Thargoids, risking millions of lives. My sources tell me that Hind Mine asteroid base contains evidence of this. I therefore demand that Taurus Mining Ventures allows us access so we can determine the truth.”

Patience Middleton of Taurus Mining Ventures responded:

“We are a legitimate business under contract to a private citizen, whose activities are protected by confidentiality agreements. These threats have no legal standing and are not welcome.”

Admiral Tanner is a highly decorated Federal Navy officer and Aegis’s chief military liaison, having coordinated many combat efforts against the Thargoids. The Musashi’s relocation has been condemned by Aegis leadership, and Tanner has been ordered to depart the T Tauri system.

## 08 NOV

### ACT Captures Theta Group

The creators of the NMLA’s caustic enzyme bombs have been arrested, although the terrorist figurehead Theta Seven remains at large.

Theta Group is directly responsible for 17 starport bombings conducted by the NMLA across the core systems. These attacks resulted in a combined death toll of almost 800,000 people, with twice as many suffering serious injury.

Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez, one of the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit’s co-leaders, told the media:

“We have finally tracked down the NMLA’s bomb-making engineers, and a joint task force made the arrest with minimal casualties. Large quantities of Thargoid corrosives and explosive components were also seized.”

“This achievement was only possible due to intercepting Theta Group’s communications with Neo-Marlinist sympathisers. We are unsure why the NMLA’s dark-comms network was not used in that instance.”

“As our intel predicted, the group’s leader Theta Seven was not among those we captured. We have confirmed that he and a handful of followers disappeared after the bombings in July, anticipating their imminent capture. ACT will not rest until the galaxy’s most wanted terrorist has been brought to justice.”

The name ‘Theta Group’ was assigned to the bomb-makers during their incarceration at Serene Harbour, an Imperial Intelligence penal facility in the R CrA Sector AF-A d42 system. After escaping, their leader adopted his prisoner designation – Theta Seven – as a reaction to what he viewed as dehumanising treatment of Neo-Marlinists by the Empire.

## 09 NOV

### No Progress with Dredger Deadlock

The nomadic Scriveners Clan continues to resist Orion University’s attempts to take possession of their dredger.

Freelance reporter Casey Kilpatrick published an update from the Oochost PC-C c29-0 system:

“Orion University’s claim that the vessel is their property has been countered by Advocacy’s reminder of laws preventing cultural contamination. So the question now is: who actually owns the dredger? Is it the families that have lived there for generations, or the organisation which originally built it?”

“Various solutions have been proposed to resolve this stand-off. These include an offer from Canonn Interstellar Research Group to purchase the dredger from Orion University, gift it to the Scriveners Clan then publicly share the contents of their mysterious Knowledge Core.”

“However, two centuries of isolation have instilled this academia-focused society with a pathological need to protect its research. They are no more likely to cooperate than a deeply religious nation asked to hand over its most holy artefact.”

“Orion’s megaship Scientia Aeterna is still transmitting requests to communicate. I have even seen one of its secondary craft narrowly avoid being consumed by the dredger’s maw while searching for an access point. But the Scriveners are locked down tight, and this siege situation shows no sign of ending.”

## 10 NOV

### Long-Lost Research Facility Discovered

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

A distress call has led independent pilots to locate an abandoned settlement in the Snake Sector GW-W c1-1 system.

The SOS was initially detected by one of the megaships that form the Colonia Bridge, inspiring many ships to search nearby systems. The source was eventually identified as Holloway Bioscience Research Facility 15 on the moon Snake Sector GW-W c1-1 AB 5 b.

Pilots unearthed a series of mission logs recorded in the year 3255 by a freelance military unit named Excalibur Troop. As yet, the contents of these logs have not been made available to newsfeeds.

Aanya Gupta, CEO of the Holloway Bioscience Institute, gave a statement to the press:

“Research Facility 15 was one of the first wave of planetary survey laboratories established by our founder, the esteemed scientist Lord Roland Holloway. Our records of these settlements are patchy, so we are grateful that this has been located.”

“Unfortunately, we can find no data regarding Excalibur Troop or the circumstances under which they were contracted. Our investigative teams are on-site to gather further information.”

The Holloway Bioscience Institute refused to comment on rumours that a previously unidentified life form had been encountered by the research facility’s original crew.

## 11 NOV

### Colonia Bridge Gains Further Resources

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Successful campaigns in the Alcor and Colonia systems will result in new megaships being added to the Colonia Bridge.

Large quantities of ceramic composites, computer components and thermal cooling units were provided at either end of the route between the core systems and the distant Colonia region.

Brewer Corporation provided an update on the project:

“Once again, the galactic community has provided the vital materials required to construct dockable megaships. These additional ports should be operational by the 25th of November, making journeys to and from Colonia easier and safer.”

“Pilots can now collect their rewards from Macdonald Settlement in the Alcor system and Jaques Station in the Colonia system. We shall also be awarding an engineered frame shift drive with long range and fast boot to the majority of contributors.”

The top ten pilots who delivered materials to Alcor and Colonia will shortly be invited to submit suggestions to name the new megaships. Submissions will be subject to review by the Brewer Corporation board of directors. To ensure a variety of choice, only pilots who have not yet submitted names for the Colonia Bridge megaships will be eligible.

### Aegis Renegades Attack Salvation's Allies

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

A rogue Aegis Defense force has initiated conflict with Taurus Mining Ventures in the T Tauri system.

The megaship Musashi is commanded by Aegis’s chief military liaison Admiral Aden Tanner, who made this announcement:

“The Hind Mine asteroid base contains proof that Salvation’s unlicensed anti-xeno weapon is intentionally designed to provoke the Thargoids, and therefore endangers us all. As Taurus Mining Ventures refuses to cooperate, we have no choice but to obtain the evidence by force.”

“This may be our only opportunity to discover Salvation’s true ambitions. I urge all independent pilots who have fought alongside Aegis to help us complete this vital mission.”

Patience Middleton, a spokesperson for Taurus Mining Ventures, responded:

“This is an illegal attack that jeopardises the important work we are undertaking on behalf of Salvation. It is in the galactic community’s interests to defend our corporate headquarters.”

Aegis officially stated that Admiral Tanner is acting on his own authority, and that the Musashi’s presence in the T Tauri system is in direct violation of orders. Despite this, there are reports that Tanner has tacit support from many members of Aegis, who disagree with the public inquiry that has suspended its operations.

## 12 NOV

### Manhunt for Theta Seven Escalates

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit has acquired an encrypted message that may reveal Theta Seven’s location.

ACT successfully captured most of the bomb-making engineers known as Theta Group, and has now prioritised hunting down the NMLA’s de facto leader.

This latest breakthrough was explained by Captain Milo Castile:

“Theta Group managed to delete most of their data prior to capture, but we retrieved a short message that they received on the 31st of July. At this point most of Theta Group were being harboured by Neo-Marlinist sympathisers within the Marlinist Colonies, but Theta Seven and his closest aides had fled to an unknown destination.”

“Unfortunately the message has been encrypted using a pre-arranged cipher key, without which its contents are unreadable. It is unclear why this wasn’t transmitted via the NMLA’s dark-comms network, which remains undetectable despite our best efforts.”

“As it’s possible that this was sent by Theta Seven, we welcome any assistance from the galactic community in decoding it. This ruthless terrorist must be tracked down before he can take more innocent lives.”

ACT has requested that all newsfeeds publish the encrypted message, which is as follows:

61-76-126-67-99-74-71-113-81-41-96-103-51-117-55-103-91-69-104-117-84-114-141-134-90-108-90-79-115-95-102-102-98-76-91-57-83-104-92-99-96-78-79-83-132-115-80-106-91-150-114-105-148-144-93-163-83-138-123-94-108-115-81-128-147-162-131-140-150-129-29-98-99-59-74-125-55-123-107-112-98-108-82-91-124-71-75-111-109-95-129-89-155-135-98-131-149-97-151-105-152-152-144-128-155-64-81-123-89-90-87-96-59-116-127-52-94-103-51-89-51-47-98-88-61-112-112-111-129-147-124-153-134-109-87-114-121-80-90-113-111-153-131-84-104-131-84-151-113-129-130-117-105-123-73-99-126-106-118-144-97-83-123-104-75-78-90-49

There is a substantial reward on offer for the first person to submit a correctly deciphered version of this message to ACT.

## 15 NOV

### Dredger Clan Faces Possible Extinction

Orion University has been informed that its ownership claim of the Scriveners Clan dredger is placing its population at great risk.

In the Oochost PC-C c29-0 system, the university’s megaship Scientia Aeterna has used override codes to prevent the dredger from departing. But the nomadic tribe’s refusal to abandon their home has placed them under great pressure, as observed by freelance reporter Casey Kilpatrick:

“Dredger-class bulk cruisers are the sharks of space – they must always keep moving, constantly gathering raw materials to synthesize into fuel, air and other resources. The Scriveners Clan remained stationary for months while salvaging the Hesperus, but in this system they are trapped without such vital intakes.”

“Independent observers are now reporting malfunctions in the vessel’s power and life support systems. If the Scriveners maintain their siege mentality, further mechanical failures are inevitable. Orion might inherit the dredger after all, but it will be a ship of the dead.”

Professor Elizabeth Perez, Orion University’s head of anthropology, responded:

“The last thing we wish is for any harm to befall these people. My colleagues are urgently discussing ways to convince the Scriveners Clan that we have their best interests at heart. After all, as fellow scientists and researchers, they are a living embodiment of our university’s core values.”

## 16 NOV

### Theta Seven Traced to Panjabell System

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

A decrypted message suggests that the NMLA leader Theta Seven avoided capture by infiltrating the Far God cult.

ACT publicly requested help to decode a message received by Theta Group, the bomb-making engineers of the NMLA. The cipher key was cracked and the decoded message submitted by Commander Therion Cygni. It revealed that Theta Seven and his closest aides fled to the Panjabell system on the 31st of July.

Captain Milo Castile, one of ACT’s co-leaders, provided an update:

“Our theory is that Theta Seven and his crew were travelling undercover as Far God worshippers, who were gathering in the Panjabell system in huge numbers at that time. Since all members of this religious order renounce their past identities, this would have helped the terrorists to avoid detection.”

“The Pleiades Concordat and other factions in Panjabell are cooperating with our investigation. But it seems likely that Theta Seven is currently hiding aboard one of the three Far God megaships that were launched from the system on the 6th of August.”

“ACT agents have attempted to contact the Perdition, Sacrosanct and Testament megaships to alert them of the danger. Unfortunately the cultists consider themselves to be on a sacred pilgrimage that cannot be impeded, and that their vessels are ‘sanctuaries from further persecution by hostile security services’.”

## 17 NOV

### NMLA Retakes the Steel Majesty

A former Neo-Marlinist megaship has been overrun by NMLA terrorists in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system.

The Steel Majesty was originally owned by the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, one of the NMLA’s key allies. After their defeat, it ferried many of them to the Marlinist Colonies where they were granted asylum by Minister Aaron Whyte. His faction then made use of the megaship during the civil war in August.

Minister Jean-Christophe Lyon, the current leader of the Marlinism Reformation Party, gave a statement:

“Despite our efforts to arrest any remaining extremists within our faction, a surviving group has gained access to the megaship. Security feeds show they were joined by several teams of well-armed NMLA fighters.”

“The Marlinist Constabulary evacuated around half of the Steel Majesty’s crew before the NMLA took operational control. Sadly, there is no way to free those still trapped onboard.”

The situation was addressed by ACT’s co-leader Captain Milo Castile:

“According to our intel, a majority of the NMLA’s surviving cells have gathered together for this operation. We believe they were assisted by not only Aaron Whyte’s loyalists, but also members of the megaship’s original crew from the Mudhrid system.”

“It is possible that this Neo-Marlinist coalition was formed as a result of us closing in on Theta Seven. We have requested additional support from all security services.”

## 18 NOV

### Salvation's Allies Triumph in T Tauri System

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Taurus Mining Ventures has defeated a rogue Aegis Defense force and gained control of the megaship Musashi.

The conflict was initiated by Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison with Aegis. He was attempting to gain access to Hind Mine asteroid base, in search of evidence that Salvation’s anti-xeno weapon was deliberately designed to provoke the Thargoids.

Patience Middleton, a spokesperson for Taurus Mining Ventures, made this announcement:

“This was an illegal and unnecessary conflict, brought about by Admiral Tanner’s misguided obsession. We will continue working with Salvation to eliminate the Thargoid threat.”

“Our defence was only possible thanks to our courageous supporters, for whom rewards are available at Hind Mine. We will also honour agreements that the Aegis Defense force made with independent pilots, who can collect their promised payments from the Musashi.”

Taurus Mining Ventures later confirmed that all members of the Musashi’s original crew will be allowed to leave the megaship unharmed. Admiral Tanner and other key personnel are in temporary custody. Aegis has arranged for them to be transferred to its internal security teams.

### Dredger Deadlock Inspires Competing Campaigns

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The HIP 43670 system is hosting two competing delivery initiatives, each of which aims to benefit the Scriveners Clan.

Orion University has partnered with Independent HIP 43670 Labour, which is requesting deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data, unusual encrypted files and unidentified scan archives to Shaara Gateway in HIP 43670.

The university’s campaign was explained by Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew:

“Although Dredger J-403 is legally our property, what we value most is the Scriveners Clan’s dedication to deep-space research. To convince them of our noble intentions, we are donating scientific data and samples to their Knowledge Core. Our proposal is that they permit us to accompany them on their journey and share in any future discoveries.”

An alternative campaign is also taking place in the HIP 43670 system. Supporters of the Scriveners Clan are being asked to gather emergency power cells, power converters and power transfer buses and deliver them to the Alliance of HIP 42371 at Oramus Terminal. A spokesperson told the media:

“These supplies are needed to perform vital repairs to the dredger. Furthermore, if the power systems are sufficiently updated, they can bypass the ancient components affected by Orion University’s override codes and continue travelling independently.”

Although there remains no response from the Scriveners Clan, the dredger is now actively monitoring all local and interstellar transmissions. This is a new development for the isolated community, and suggests they are aware of these campaigns.

## 19 NOV

### Neo-Marlinist Forces Gather in Mudhrid

The megaship Steel Majesty has arrived in the Mudhrid system after being taken over by NMLA terrorists.

Its original owning faction, the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, has officially reclaimed the vessel. Margrave Corentin Delacroix, the faction’s new military ruler and the son of former Landgrave Arastin Delacroix, announced:

“The Steel Majesty has returned home to fulfil its destiny. Be warned: should any ships attempt to board or attack, all the former crewmembers still onboard will be executed.”

Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez gave a statement on behalf of ACT:

“Unfortunately, we cannot take action while hundreds of innocent people remain captive. But the NMLA’s effort to assemble troops, supporters and resources must not succeed. Having the Steel Majesty as a mobile base will allow them to regroup for a new campaign of terror – especially if they manage to reach Theta Seven before we do.”

A spokesperson for the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group, which controls the Mudhrid system, claimed:

“The hostages should be considered lost as casualties of war. We are prepared to perform our duty for the Empire once again by destroying the Neo-Marlinist threat.”

### Colonia Bridge Project Faces Possible Changes

Brewer Corporation is enhancing the travel corridor to Colonia, but details about the project’s next phase remain uncertain.

Business-related newsfeed The Tau Ceti Journal published this feature:

“There’s no doubt that Brewer Corporation always thinks big. It has enjoyed huge commercial success as a manufacturer of starports and outposts, and its Drake-class fleet carrier has been enormously popular.”

“The Colonia Bridge is the megacorp’s most expensive undertaking yet, investing hundreds of billions of credits on the transportation infrastructure between the core systems and Colonia. More than one analyst predicted that the project might financially destabilise them.”

“The first two phases proceeded on schedule. Before the end of this month, there will be a chain of 56 stationary megaships along systems between Alcor and Colonia.”

“But there are rumours of a change of plans for phase three, which may be early next year. It is believed that Brewer Corporation is revising its plans based on the unexpectedly high levels of participation from the galactic community.”

“In support of this, one company insider did reveal that more engineered frame shift drives are being manufactured, to be offered as incentives to contributing pilots in the third phase.”

## 22 NOV

### Crime Wave Raises Security Concerns

An expert larcenist known as the Winking Cat has triggered widespread alarm with a spree of high-profile thefts.

Vox Galactica published this feature by crime correspondent Mira Bukowski :

“Last month, the galaxy’s most infamous thief reappeared in the headlines after a long absence. It appears the Winking Cat is making up for lost time by stealing multiple items in quick succession.”

“One notable target was a portrait of Emperor Olban Hensard Duval, the tenth ruler of the Empire. Painted in 2989, it was notable for being seven metres high - as was the graphic of a smirking feline face engraved on the wall where it once hung.”

“Another disappearance, albeit of a less artistic nature, was the only working prototype of Achilles Corporation’s XS1001 security robot. This was being guarded by several XS801 models which, according to insiders, were found lying on their sides and emitting an unusual ‘purring’ sound.”

“There are reports of several other rare or precious artefacts disappearing from secure locations. In all cases, there are no clues as to how security systems were circumvented.”

“The Wallglass Investigations Agency has theorised that the Winking Cat may not be an individual after all, but a group of criminal specialists working together. They also suspect that these latest thefts may be intended for some larger purpose.”

## 24 NOV

### Far God Megaship Hijacked by Theta Seven

NMLA figurehead Theta Seven has taken control of the Sacrosanct megaship and redirected it to the Mudhrid system.

Several months ago, the leader of Theta Group and his closest aides evaded capture by posing as members of the Far God cult. One of their pilgrimage vessels, the Sacrosanct, has now bypassed its scheduled flight plan and jumped to Mudhrid.

ACT’s joint leader Captain Milo Castile broadcast an emergency statement:

“We can confirm that despite being few in number, the terrorists are in command of the Sacrosanct. Since Far God worshippers are pacifists and fatalistic in nature, it’s likely that they offered little resistance.”

“Theta Seven has stated that he will wipe out the vessel’s entire population if any attempt to seize the vessel is made. Our intel suggests he possesses caustic enzyme explosives of the type used in the starport bombings, making his threat credible.”

Also in the system is the Steel Majesty megaship, recently overtaken by the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid. ACT believes that the NMLA is regrouping its forces and aims to provide protection for Theta Seven.

Mudhrid’s ruling faction, the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group, has ordered system security to shoot down any vessels attempting to pass between the two megaships.

### Gatekeeper Megaships Established

Factions responsible for the distribution of conditional access permits have deployed so-called Gatekeeper megaships to neighbouring systems.

The agreement between 14 factions intends to allow permit distribution procedures to continue regardless of the political status of the associated systems. Though the reason for system access restrictions varies between the factions, preventing any disruption to interstellar trade was a key factor in the talks.

A spokesperson for Alioth Independents, one of the factions involved, offered the following:

“It is rare that so many participants from across the core systems are able to reach an agreement so easily. These megaships will ensure that the flow of traffic within our respective borders remains appropriately controlled, providing support for the permit offices in those systems.”

“Only a few short years ago, the system of Tiliala saw disruption in assigning permits to eligible visitors due to political disturbances. The Panjabell system experienced this problem again within recent months. These lessons have inspired us to prevent further repetitions in the future.”

“I would like to thank each faction representative for their contributions to maintaining consistency in our methods for the ease of pilots, recognising the valuable contributions they make to the galactic economy.”

Permit distribution to eligible recipients will still be carried out remotely.

## 25 NOV

### Dredger Clan Freed from Orion University

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The Scriveners Clan dredger has been fully repaired, following twin initiatives in the HIP 43670 system.

A campaign by supporters of the Scriveners Clan delivered emergency power cells, power converters and power transfer buses to the Alliance of HIP 42371 at Oramus Terminal. A spokesperson for the group announced:

“As a result of our efforts, the dredger has received sufficient supplies to effect repairs. Most importantly, the new power systems mean it will shortly be able to bypass Orion University’s override codes and be free to travel the galaxy once more.”

A parallel campaign by Orion University’s partner Independent HIP 43670 Labour requested deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data, unusual encrypted files and unidentified scan archives to Shaara Gateway in HIP 43670. However, these were not sufficient to convince the nomadic tribe to agree to its offer of sharing future discoveries.

Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew expressed his regret, but confirmed that Orion University will honour the outcome and withdraw its claim over the dredger.

Contributors to both initiatives can now collect their rewards from Shaara Gateway or Oramus Terminal in the HIP 43670 system.

### The Battle of Mudhrid

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid and the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group have declared war in the Mudhrid system.

The Steel Majesty megaship is serving as the base of the Neo-Marlinist forces. These include many surviving NMLA terrorist cells that gathered to overtake the vessel from the Marlinist Colonies.

Also in the system is the Far God cult megaship Sacrosanct, where the NMLA’s de facto leader Theta Seven and the remnants of Theta Group have been in hiding for months. They recently took control of the vessel and are holding thousands of cultists hostage.

The Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid have offered a uniquely augmented enzyme missile rack to its highest contributors if certain objectives are met. Margrave Corentin Delacroix broadcast a call to arms:

“All those who seek to topple the Duval dictators must fight alongside us here and now. Neo-Marlinism has no future unless its believers defend it.”

The Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group is orchestrating its campaign from Payne-Scott City starport. Senator Denton Patreus has requested that Imperial auxiliaries provide the faction with combat support.

ACT’s co-leader Captain Saskia Landau stated:

“The NMLA clearly places huge value on Theta Seven’s ability to produce caustic enzyme weapons, and has risked concentrating in large numbers to defend him. If he can transfer to the Steel Majesty and escape, the threat of further atrocities like the Nine Martyrs bombings will remain high.”

### Colonia Bridge Project Extended to 3308

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The second phase of the Colonia Bridge project is complete, with Brewer Corporation confirming details for phase three.

An additional 26 megaships have taken up stationary positions in systems between Alcor and Colonia. Along with the existing 30 megaships, these will provide convenient rest, refuel and repair facilities to those travelling to and from the distant Colonia region.

A press release from Brewer Corporation addressed the next steps:

“The galactic community has made enormous contributions to establishing the Colonia Bridge. Encouraged by this, we have revised our plans and increased investment in the project.”

“The next phase is scheduled to commence on the 6th of January 3308, and will add starports to key locations along the route. These will provide further services and opportunities to pilots, as well as forming permanent micro-communities between the core systems and Colonia.”

“Phase three will also address the availability of tritium, to improve refuelling capacity for owners of our Drake-class fleet carriers. To incentivise the delivery of vital materials, we will be offering the same engineered frame shift drives that proved so popular during phase two.”

### Aegis Renegades Face Criminal Charges

Admiral Aden Tanner and the crew of the Musashi megaship will be placed on trial for attacking Salvation’s allies.

The admiral disobeyed orders by attempting to gain access to Hind Mine starport, the headquarters of Taurus Mining Ventures. After failing to achieve this, most of the Musashi’s crewmembers were detained and repatriated to their respective home systems to face civil or military charges.

The Federal Navy has published this official notice:

“Admiral Tanner is formally accused of mutiny and unlawful military action while in command of the Musashi. He will stand trial in a general court-martial. If found guilty, he will be dishonourably discharged and imprisoned for life.”

Dr Paul Baumann, chair of the independent board of inquiry into Aegis, commented:

“Recent events in the T Tauri system clearly fall within the scope of our investigation. For Aegis’s chief military liaison to launch an unauthorised attack, at the cost of many lives, will weigh heavily against the organisation.”

Admiral Tanner claims that the anti-xeno superweapon deployed by Salvation in the Cornsar system has triggered an increase in Thargoid attacks. Although there is no direct evidence of this, the Thargoids have performed coordinated strikes against several systems in the weeks since that event.

### Thargoid Invasion of Nebula Systems Intensifies

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Systems in the California, Coalsack, Pleiades and Witch Head Nebulas are under sustained assault by the Thargoids.

Vox Galactica featured this report from freelance war correspondent Ernesto Rios:

“Multiple starports have been crippled by Thargoid attacks in recent weeks, with anti-xeno squadrons struggling to protect them. Many Commanders told me that this latest wave is proving unusually difficult to repel, with a steady stream of reinforcements replacing those alien vessels destroyed in battle.”

“In normal times Aegis would coordinate the defence effort, but its operations remain suspended due to the Baumann inquiry. Today, it is clear that many of the superpowers’ leaders have more faith in Salvation after his triumph in the Cornsar system, believing that he holds the key to defeating the Thargoids.”

“Both the Imperial Navy and the Alliance’s Council of Admirals have suggested committing naval forces to support Salvation. In the Federation, Congress has debated redirecting funds that were ring-fenced for Aegis to accelerate development of the anti-xeno superweapon.”

“As yet these are merely discussions, but do illustrate the wide-reaching impact of the Cornsar incident. In the meantime, in the absence of direct support from either Aegis or Salvation, pilots are sacrificing their lives as they fight courageously to push back the Thargoid fleets.”
