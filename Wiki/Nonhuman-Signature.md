- *Not to be confused with Non-Human Signal Source.*

## Nonhuman Signature

		

### Type

Spontaneous

### Threat Level(s)

N/A

### Activities

Salvage

A **Nonhuman Signature**^[*sic*]^ is a type of Point of Interest that can be detected from orbit and accessed while On Foot or in a SRV.

## Contents

At present, Nonhuman Signatures contain either a number of Sensor Fragments, which can be retrieved with a SRV's Cargo Scoop, or a damaged Thargoid Sensor. The sensor can be destroyed and collected as fragments, or scooped whole and safely transported with a Corrosion Resistant Cargo Rack for sale at a port.

## Spawn Locations

In contrast with Non-Human Signal Sources and other Thargoid-related sites which are confined mainly to the Pleiades Nebula, Witch Head Nebula, and Coalsack Nebula, Nonhuman Signatures have been reported in those areas as well as in systems that are thousands of light years away from regions of known Thargoid activity. Signatures tend to occur in systems with at least one gas giant with ammonia-based life.

## Notes

- Nonhuman Signatures were introduced in *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*.
