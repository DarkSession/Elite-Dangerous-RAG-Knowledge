> Limpets controlled by this module can collect canisters and asteroid chunks automatically. Two modes of operation are possible. First a chunk or canister can be collected quickly by deploying the limpet whilst targeting the object in question; this will consume the limpet. Second a limpet can be deployed with no collectable object targeted and will result in the limpet entering a slower autonomous mode where it will collect any available object automatically for a set time. To collect asteroid chunks in either mode requires a Refinery module to be fitted.

The **Collector Limpet Controller** is a type of Limpet Controller module that can program limpets to retrieve commodities, materials, and asteroid fragments in the vicinity of a ship, and load them into the ship's cargo hold through the Cargo Hatch. They operate in one of two modes: targeted collecting, in which a single limpet will rapidly retrieve a single targeted object and then immediately expire, and non-targeted collecting, in which any deployed limpets will automatically retrieve any objects in the area until they expire.

## Usage

Collector Limpets make the process of gathering cargo after a battle or during mining a much faster and easier process than doing so manually. The number of active limpets for a Collector Limpet Controller will stack with other Collector Limpet Controllers, which can improve collection efficiency.

If there are no valid targets within range for non-targeted Collector Limpets to collect, the deployed Limpets will remain close to their mothership until they expire or until a new valid target enters their range.

Collector Limpets are useful for many pilot roles, as they can be used to easily retrieve materials, salvage from destroyed ships, abandoned cargo in combat areas, items such as Black Boxes or Occupied Escape Pods from exploration sites and Signal Sources, and mined resources. Targeted Collector Limpets can be especially useful to pirates, as they are immune to Point Defence Turrets.

As Collector Limpets do not differentiate between Legal and Illegal Salvage containers, exercise caution when using Collector Limpets to salvage in combat areas, as containers ejected from other ships due to Cargo Hatch damage will be considered stolen and may result in fines from the local authorities if detected on scans. Collector Limpets will not retrieve items set to "Ignored" in the Contacts panel and will not attempt to retrieve any of your own cargo lost to Hatch Breaker Limpets.
