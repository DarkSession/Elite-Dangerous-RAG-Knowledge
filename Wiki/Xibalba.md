# Xibalba
**Xibalba** is galactic region #37 in the Milky Way. It is bordered by Kepler's Crest, Achilles's Altar, Lyra's Song, and Tenebrae.

The region lies on the edge of the galaxy and is almost entirely devoid of stars. Most stars in Xibalba are concentrated in the region's south, which contains the tip of the Milky Way's Outer Arm. Just beyond that area is an isolated cluster of stars over 1,500 light-years in diameter that cannot be reached because of jump range limitations.
