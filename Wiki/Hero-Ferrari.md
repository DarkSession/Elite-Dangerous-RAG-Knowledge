> 
> Little is known of Hero's history, and it is widely believed that she operates under a pseudonym. She is skilled with weapons modification and demonstrates a keen knowledge of military-grade technology, but appears comfortable in the relatively sedate world of engineering. When not upgrading equipment, Hero practices traditional calligraphy and watercolour techniques.
