## Usage

The Mining Lance's combat performance is comparable to a Class 1 fixed Beam Laser, against which it has 67% of the maximum range, 113% of the power draw, 82% of the DPS, 171% the thermal load, and 90% of the distributor draw. Its mining performance is identical to a Class 1 Mining Laser, although it has a 2000 m range instead of 500 m.

Unfortunately, due to a lack of engineering, this weapon is largely ineffective for combat purposes, dealing significantly less damage than other combat lasers, for more energy. Additionally, while this weapon at one point was the only long-ranged mining laser option, it has since been supplanted in that role as well, with the release of the Modified Mining Laser, available from Torval Megaships listed on that article. This mining laser has longer range and better mining efficiency.

As a result, the Mining Lance is completely obsolete, and no longer worth unlocking in safe mining environments.

The mining lance has one specific purpose, which is mining under fire, e.g. in hazardous ressource extraction sites. A properly set up ship (like the Type-10) can fire at the rock, while simultaneously fighting off pirates with its turrets, without having to switch fire groups, as the mining lances can fire in combat mode. The advantage is a doubled yield of fragments in hazres sites, as well as the materials collected from attacking ships and their subsequent bounties.
