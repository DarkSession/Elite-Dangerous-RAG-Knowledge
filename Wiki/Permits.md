## Overview

A permit is a special access code that is downloaded to a ship's navigation computer. It allows that ship to plot and execute a hyperspace jump to the corresponding permit-locked system. Commanders who lack the appropriate permit cannot enter a permit-locked system, and are blocked from plotting a route in the Galaxy Map through that system. Furthermore, Fleet Carriers are barred from traveling to all permit-locked systems, regardless of whether the owners have the permit. Possession of a permit is granted on a permanent or temporary basis.

The Pilots Federation holds the authority to place permit restrictions on systems. It seals off systems at the request of a faction, in response to the presence of significant hazards or threats. Generally, the permit-holder faction of a restricted system decides whether to distribute their permit to the public. Permit-holder factions that allow the distribution of their permits typically set specific criteria which commanders must satisfy to earn them. Permit-locked systems may offer exclusive commodities, ship and module discounts, or simply access to unique locations.

In general, permits can be acquired through one of three methods:

- Achieving the required rank in one of the professional fields tracked by the Pilots Federation, or in the Federal Navy and Imperial Navy, will unlock a permit.
- Earning a Reputation level of Allied with the minor faction that controls the permit's distribution will cause that faction to offer an invitation mission at a station in a system in close proximity to the permit-locked system where that faction has a presence. Completing the invitation mission will unlock the permit. Most of the factions that distribute permits in this manner have a specific megaship under permanent control to ensure that pilots seeking an invitation mission have a consistent place to access it.
- Some permits are awarded permanently or temporarily through Community Goals or participation in time-limited activities.

## Notes

- According to Drew Wagar, author of the official *Elite Dangerous* novels *Elite: Reclamation* and *Elite Dangerous: Premonition*, there was originally intended to be an explanation in the game's narrative for why multiple areas of the galaxy required "Unknown Permits". One such permit-locked area near Barnard's Loop was reserved for certain content that was apparently shelved or retconned out in late 2017. Subsequent narrative developments such as Aegis and Eagle Eye represented a change in direction from the original game plans.^[1]^^[2]^
