Roberta Unwin, an economist who regularly contributes to the Money Matters news feed, commented on the announcement: "Wealthy organisations often expand into new areas without any immediate plans in mind. Sometimes it's because they think the area will become profitable â€“ other times it's done to undercut a rival. It's called speculative expansion. It's actually rather common, although it usually takes place on a much smaller scale."^[1]^
