The moon of the third planet in the CPD-65 2513 system sports an intriguing multi-level plateau and twisting canyons under the blue and purple glow of the nebula. The site is named in reference to the Azure Dragon of the West, one of the four mythological spirit creatures of the Chinese constellations.
