> The Empire has always gone for opulence, style and quality with no expense spared. Their capital ships are not just warships, but also serve as roving embassies or giant yachts for their wealthy and powerful owners. Internally they are luxurious, at least in those parts used for entertaining, with the internal rotating ring providing comfortable artificial gravity for ambassadorial dinner parties. Guests would have little indication they were in space, let alone aboard a powerful warship.

The **Majestic-Class Interdictor** is a battlecruiser manufactured by Gutamaya exclusively for the Empire. As a capital ship, the Majestic serves as the backbone of the Imperial Navy and the core of each of its fleets. In contrast with its Federal Navy counterpart, the Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser, the Majestic-Class prioritises opulence over firepower, as seen in its prominent artificial gravity centrifuge which houses the crew barracks, as well as luxurious quarters and amenities for officials and guests. Nonetheless, it is still a fearsome warship that enemies of the Empire provoke at their peril.

## Overview

> I know there are some who would question the need for this vessel. To those individuals, I say this: just how safe do you feel? We live in an age in which even Emperors can be murdered. An age in which our enemies' faces are not known to us, and betrayal and deceit are encountered at every turn. The need for a strong, battle-ready navy has never been greater.

The Majestic-Class Interdictor is almost two kilometers long, armed with an array of 3 beam lasers and 14 dual-mounted modular interceptor railguns, and equipped with hangars capable of transporting multiple smaller Imperial military ships and Gu-97 squadrons. It is equipped with a capital-class Frame Shift Drive^[3]^ with an undisclosed jump range. The latest of the Imperial Navy's long-running line of Interdictors, the Majestic-Class was introduced in the late 3200s and continues the Imperial tradition of capital ships serving as luxurious and technologically-advanced mobile embassies. The Empire is proud of its navy, and fleets accompany most colonial missions or important events.^[4]^

From 3278 to 3302, the construction of Majestic-Class Interdictors as well as other capital ships was restricted by the terms of the London Treaty, which was created to prevent an arms race between the superpowers that was projected to occur with the introduction of the Frame Shift Drive. Imperial Senator and Fleet Admiral Denton Patreus publicly spurned the London Treaty on October 21, 3302 in a speech in which he declared he would build as many capital ships as the Empire needed for its defence, marking the Empire's withdrawal from the treaty and heralding its dissolution.^[5]^^[6]^

Since the outbreak of the Second Thargoid War in 3303, multiple Majestic-Class Interdictors have been destroyed by Thargoid Interceptors due to the former's vulnerability to Thargoid shutdown fields. Since the anti-xeno countermeasures developed for smaller ships have proven prohibitively difficult to scale-up for capital ships, the international research and defence organisation Aegis has declared that capital ships are ineffective at protecting outposts, planets, and shipping lanes from Thargoid attacks at present. Instead, anti-Thargoid efforts have been spearheaded by militias of personal-scale craft.^[7]^^[8]^

During a period of increased tensions between the Empire  and the Federation in late 3306 caused by the activities of the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army, Senator Denton Patreus convinced the Imperial Senate to approve a funding increase for the Imperial Navy in order to expand production of Majestic-Class Interdictors.^[9]^ With assistance from independent pilots, this resulted in four new Majestics being fast-tracked for completion, with planned deployments in Chimechilo, Orannika, Theta Indi, and Zelano.^[10]^

Following the disbandment of the tri-superpower xeno defence agency Aegis, the Imperial Navy was required to organise it's own anti-xeno forces. To this end, a number of Majestic-Class Interdictors were upgraded with prototype AX weaponry, allowing them to endure and contribute to the fight in AX Conflict Zones. A trio of these modified ships were deployed to HIP 22460 as part of the Empire's Contribution to Salvation's operations in the system (alongside Federal Battlecruisers with similar upgrades) though all were lost following the disastrous activation of the Proteus Wave. Since then, similar AX Interdictors have been deployed to Imperial controlled systems under Thargoid Invasion, since the arrival of the Maelstroms.

## Notes

- David Braben describes the Majestic-Class Interdictor: *"...where luxury comes is where you've actually got gravity. That's why this thing is spinning, it's using the centripetal force to actually give you the sensation of gravity as you move around. This ship is huge and that round section is also huge, and the point is even a low level of gravity is very comfortable, you know water settles...you actually see the contrast with the Empire where for the senior people, at least on this ship, they get gravity for their sleeping quarters, for where they eat and all that sort of thing..."*^[16]^
- After destroying all of the Majestic-Class's Heat Relays the ship will escape from battle by activating its Frame Shift Drive.
- Most Capital Ships have an exclusion zone, and flying too close to one can provoke it into attacking even if the player is on friendly terms with its controlling faction. In these cases, the Capital Ship will issue warning messages to ships that invade its exclusion zone.

## Trivia

- The length of the Majestic-Class Interdictor (1,904 meters) is almost as long as six Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers (337 meters) lined up end to end.^[17]^
