Hind Mine Asteroid Base
 		 	 

An **Asteroid Base** is a station built inside a large, hollowed asteroid. They can be found in various deep space locations such as nebulae^[1]^. Following the release of the Trailblazers update, they are an occasional sight in player colonised systems.

Asteroid Bases hold 4 small Landing Pads, 8 medium pads, and 6 large pads. While they rotate like other station types, the rate of rotation is noticeably slower. Available services vary between Asteroid Bases; while all are equipped with a commodities market, refueling, repair, and restock, some may also have a blackmarket, outfitting, and shipyard facilities.

## Types

There are 3 types of Asteroid stations. These can be constructed at a planetary ring or asteroid cluster with system colonisation. The services and vendors are similar for all three types.

## Colonisation

Asteroid Bases are Tier 2 in Colonisation. They require planetary rings or asteroid clusters for placement. Ring types (rock, metal, ice) will create different base appearances. If selected as the main (first) station, it can be constructed with the following resources delivered to the colony ship within 4 weeks.
