This disambiguation page lists all the official Elite universe **timelines** published or dates mentioned by Frontier Developments and various official sources over the years.

There are currently two published timelines in the Elite universe. The Elite Timeline pertains the classic Elite games (Elite, Frontier: Elite II and Frontier: First Encounters). The Elite Dangerous timeline has some disparities and shares many similarities with the classic Elite games. Much lore is taken from official manuals, novels, books and in-game events covered by GalNet.
