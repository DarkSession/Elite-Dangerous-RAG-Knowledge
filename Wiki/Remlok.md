## Notes

- According to *Elite Encounters RPG*, the Remlok Survival Mask costs 10 credits. The novel *Elite: Mostly Harmless* mentions that the Remlok mask is expensive to recharge after use.
- The Remlok mask, and by extension the corporation Remlok, was introduced to the Elite series in the 1984 novella *Elite: The Dark Wheel* by Robert Holdstock. Although *Elite: The Dark Wheel* was written as a companion story for *Elite*, the Remlok mask did not appear in that game by name or as a gameplay mechanic.
