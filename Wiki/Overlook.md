The **Overlook** was a Sanchez-Class Science Vessel megaship operated by Black Flight. It was stationed in HIP 22460 to support Project Seraph's studies of ancient Thargoid Surface Sites found in the system. Shortly before the onset of the Second Thargoid War in 3303, just as Black Flight was planning to vacate the system, the Overlook was attacked by the Thargoids and left permanently disabled. Independent pilots finally gained access to HIP 22460 and discovered the derelict vessel on August 26, 3307.

## Notes

- Originally, Overlook was a Flight Operations Carrier megaship under the control of the Pleiades Resource Enterprise, a Federation-aligned minor faction. However, HIP 22460's permit was unobtainable at the time, and only players who had visited the system and scanned it before it was permit-locked were able to view its System Map and see Overlook. At the same time as the system permit was made available on August 26, 2021, Overlook was retconned from a Flight Operations Carrier to a Sanchez-Class Science Vessel.
