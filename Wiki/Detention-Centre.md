Pilgrim's Ruin, a Detention Centre
 		 	 

A **Detention Centre**, also known as a **Judicial Facility**, is a type of Flight Operations Carrier Megaship where criminal pilots are detained and forced to either pay off their accumulated fines and bounties or accept bankruptcy before they can be released.

When Security Forces detect criminal fines or bounties on a ship and then destroy it, the ship's pilot is apprehended and transferred to the nearest Detention Centre with jurisdiction. Crimes committed in independent systems are handled by Detention Centres under the Independent Detention Foundation; Federation systems are handled by the Federal Internment Corporation, Empire systems by the Imperial Detainment Company, and Alliance systems by the Alliance Incarceration Concern.^[1]^^[2]^

## Notes

- Ships that are destroyed unrelated to a crime will respawn at the nearest and safest Starport in the system if possible or revert to the last port docked.^[2]^
- If you are at a Detention Centre, you are in a solo, private space until you engage your Frameshift Drive. This is so that other people can't wait around and gank you.^[1]^
- When a ship is wanted (hot) and when you store it, then you can't transfer it to a system where it's wanted. Any modules that are in the ship are also hot. So if you take them out then you can't put them into other ships that aren't wanted. If you put any clean modules into a wanted ship then they become hot. This prevents loopholes to clean or launder a wanted ship.^[1]^
- Detention Centres do not go into Lockdown, so CMDRs wanting to use a Detention Centre as their home station will not have trouble with them.
- When respawning at a Detention Center the player must pay off their fines and bounties of the previous jurisdiction including rebuy costs if the ship was destroyed. All other bounties and fines remain attached to the ship. If you don't pay then you will be forced to choose the Sidewinder, and lose the old ship and its loadout.
- If you die on foot or in an SRV while you have a bounty, your ship will be transported to the Detention Centre that you spawn at and will be immediately available for you to use.
