The **Valkyrie** was an Anaconda in the service of the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit. In March 3307, Captain Niamh Seutonia of the Imperial Internal Security Service took the ship to investigate the Mudhrid system for Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army activity on behalf of ACT. After seemingly confirming that the NMLA's top bombmakers were present and would be traveling toward the Marlinist Colonies, the Valkyrie set out in pursuit, but the vessel was apparently ambushed in the Trianguli Sector GW-W b1-0 system and crashed on planet 1 A. The shipwreck was discovered on March 25, 3307 by CMDR TheRealFlame, and Captain Seutonia's final logs were recovered intact.

## History

After tracing the flight plans of nine cargo vessels, believed to have been used to smuggle bombs into the nine starports that were damaged in the Nine Martyrs attack carried out by the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army on March 11, 3307, to the Mudhrid system, Captain Niamh Seutonia, a member of the Imperial Internal Security Service and a joint leader of the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit tasked with hunting down the NMLA, traveled to the system with a small team aboard the Valkyrie. The ship departed on March 22 and arrived at Payne-Scott City in Mudhrid on March 23. There, the ACT team found that the NMLA was receiving support from the Order of Mudhrid, a small faction led by Landgrave Arastin Delacroix, who was offering the NMLA the use of his personal megaship, the Steel Majesty. More intriguingly, Captain Seutonia learned that Theta Group, the NMLA's leading bombmakers were apparently present in Mudhrid.

Theta Group boarded a ship and departed on a course for the Marlinist Colonies on March 24. Captain Seutonia and her team followed in the Valkyrie, with Seutonia contacting Captain Milo Castile to arrange an interception of Theta Group. The Valkyrie never arrived at the rendezvous, however. Sometime between March 24 and March 25, the Valkyrie was ambushed in the Trianguli Sector GW-W b1-0 system. It was disabled by weapons fire and crashed on planet 1 A, killing all crew and passengers on impact.

Captain Castile reported to ACT that the Valkyrie did not make the scheduled rendezvous. On March 25, Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez, another of ACT's joint leaders, called on the galactic community to search for the missing ship along its original heading. Within hours, the Valkyrie's crash site was located by CMDR TheRealFlame and Captain Seutonia's final logs were recovered, revealing that she had likely been lured into a fatal trap set by the NMLA. Senior Agent Ramirez publicly confirmed the Valkyrie's discovery on March 31, and announced that in response to the evidence in the late Captain Seutonia's logs, ACT had opened an investigation into the Order of Mudhrid for collaborating with the NMLA in the Nine Martyrs attack.

| 1/1 | Voice transcript log: Captain Niamh Seutonia<br>Timestamp: 22/03/3307 15:38
<br>After analysing traffic reports from the nine attacked stations, I think I've correlated a pattern. I traced the flight plans of all recent ships and there are nine cargo vessels - one at each starport - that passed through the Mudhrid system on the same date a week before. That can't be coincidence!<br><br><br>I'm taking the Valkyrie and a small team to see what we can find.<br><br><br>Timestamp: 23/03/3307 12:56<br><br><br>We're at Payne-Scott City. Local IISS are already monitoring one of the smaller factions here: the Order of Mudhrid. Its leader, the Landgrave Delacroix, has expressed support for replacing the Duvals with new rulers.<br><br><br>My theory is that the NMLA were using Mudhrid as a staging post for the bombings. There are Imperial, Federal, and independent factions in this system. So maybe they had agents with them, arranging cargo transports into each superpower's space.<br><br><br>Timestamp: 23/03/3307 23:33<br><br><br>We've raided a cell of NMLA activists being hidden by the Order of Mudhrid. Captured data confirms that the Landgrave is gathering Neo-Marlinists to his megaship, the Steel Majesty.<br><br><br>But that's not the real prize. Theta Group itself are here! Have we got a chance to take out the NMLA's bombmakers?<br><br><br>Timestamp: 24/03/3307 07:01<br><br><br>We're back on the Valkyrie. We managed to identify Theta Group's ship before it jumped into hyperspace, and are currently in hot pursuit.<br><br><br>It looks like they're heading toward the Marlinist Colonies. I've made contact with Captain Castile, who's en route to intercept them.<br><br><br>Still... I'm starting to wonder about the veracity of this info. Are Theta Group really on that ship, or is it bait? I'm duplicating all our data and logs into the flight computer core as a precaution. But I hope this will be an early victory for us.<br> |

## Timeline

31 MAR 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
The vessel of Captain Niamh Seutonia, who vanished on an anti-NMLA mission, has been found with its crew dead. Following a widespread search by independent pilots, Commander TheRealFlame was the first to discover the wreckage of the Valkyrie in the Trianguli sector GW-W B1-0 system. It was apparent that the ship crashed after sustaining weapons fire, and that all crewmembers died on impact. ACT co-leader Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez gave this statement to the media: "We owe a debt to every pilot who joined our efforts to find the Valkyrie. It's an emotional blow for us to lose one of ACT's guiding lights, along with her courageous team. However, Captain Seutonia managed to secure her mission logs moments before the ship's destruction. This allowed vital information to be recovered. We now have evidence confirming that a Neo-Marlinist faction in the Mudhrid system was directly involved in the NMLA starport bombings. We have shared our findings with Imperial authorities, and the Order of Mudhrid is being investigated." Captain Niamh Seutonia rose to prominence as part of the tri-superpower taskforce that eliminated the League of Reparation in 3304. The Imperial Internal Security Service confirmed that she will be posthumously awarded the Achenar Service Cross.^[1]^

25 MAR 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Assistance is needed to track down an ACT operative who vanished while on a mission to identify NMLA suppliers. The missing agent is Captain Niamh Seutonia of the Imperial Internal Security Service, one of the joint leaders of the anti-NMLA intelligence unit. She was following up on clues resulting from analysis of the 'Nine Martyrs' starport bombings. Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez, a co-leader of ACT, gave this statement: "Captain Seutonia and her team were travelling on an Anaconda-class vessel named the Valkyrie. Mission details are scarce as information was compartmentalised for security, but she was investigating a minor faction that may be supplying the NMLA. We know that her ship left the Mudhrid system on the 24th of March, on a heading toward the Marlinist Colonies. Captain Castile of the Marlinist Constabulary, on secondment to ACT, arranged a rendezvous that she never reached. So we know the Valkyrie went missing somewhere inbetween. All Commanders in the region are asked to join the search for Captain Seutonia's ship. Our fervent hope is that we find its crew alive, and that they managed to obtain data to help us defeat the NMLA."^[2]^
