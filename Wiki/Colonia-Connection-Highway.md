# Colonia Connection Highway
The original Colonia Connection Highway
 		 	 

The **Colonia Connection Highway** is a network of Starports, Outposts, Surface Ports, and Megaships that stretches across 22,000 light-years to connect the Core Systems to the distant Colonia Region, home of the famed Colonia system and Jaques Station.

## Overview

### Colonia Connection

On September 15, 3302, Latugara PLC, an independent organisation based out of the Latugara system, announced plans to construct a series of resupply outposts called the Colonia Connection between the Core Systems and the Colonia Region, where the missing Jaques Station was located three months earlier and a burgeoning new community was beginning to form.^[1]^ After gathering materials from the galactic community at Love Orbital, Latugara over a period of four weeks, Latugara PLC announced the campaign's successful conclusion.^[2]^ On October 14, 3302, the resupply outposts were completed and their locations announced.^[3]^

### Blue Star Line

On August 24, 3303, the Kamadhenu Chapterhouse of Inquisition announced plans to establish three starports between the Core Systems and Colonia, along with the creation of a freight and passenger transportation service known as the Blue Star Line.^[4]^ The three-week campaign successfully concluded on September 14, 3303, with the Kamadhenu Chapterhouse of Inquisition having amassed enough materials to build all three stations, as well as three orbital outposts.^[5]^^[6]^

### Colonia Bridge

Brewer Corporation partnered with the Colonia Council on October 7, 3307 to fund the most significant expansion of the Colonia Connection yet: the Colonia Bridge. The first phase of the four-part project involved the construction of 30 Flight Operations Carrier Megaships that were deployed on October 28 and stationed at 400-500 light-year intervals between the Colonia Region and the Core Systems.^[7]^^[8]^^[9]^ The second phase, which began on November 4, 3307, supplied the production needs of another 26 Megaships to complete the route, and was deployed on November 25.^[10]^^[11]^ The third phase began on January 6, 3308, and constructed six Ocellus starports that were deployed on January 28.^[12]^^[13]^^[14]^ The fourth phase took place between February 10 and March 10, 3308, and implemented a selection of services on the six Colonia Bridge starports.^[15]^

### Other stopovers

Since Jaques Station's rediscovery and the settlement of the Colonia Region, a number of independent outposts, mainly Asteroid Bases and Detention Centres, have been established between there and the Core Systems. While not formally part of the Colonia Connection Highway, they are conveniently located along or in close proximity to the main route.

### Bulk Cruisers

Since June 28, 3304, multiple Bulk Cruiser Megaships have also been spotted traveling the Colonia Connection, jumping to a new destination on their flight plans each week. These ships include Freedom Class Survey Vessel CTC-023, Freedom Class Survey Vessel PNF-542, Hercules Class Bulk Cargo Ship NLS-088, James Class Bulk Cargo Ship LNP-723, James Class Bulk Cargo Ship VKN-091, Naphtha Class Tanker MAL-086, and Sagan Class Tourist Ship TLS-051.

## List of ports

As of January 27, 3308, the Colonia Connection includes 65 inhabited systems and 82 ports between Alcor in the Core Systems and Colonia in the Colonia Region.
