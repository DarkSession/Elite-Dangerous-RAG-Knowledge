Omnipol officer
 		 	 

Omnipol agents are non-aligned. They patrol certain settlements, man the concourses of Prison Ships, and take part in certain illegal Mercenary missions. 

Unusually, Omnipol personnel at a ground settlement will intermittently stop and scan any NPC and commander that crosses their path.

When deployed to surface sites, Omnipol agents will arrive via customized Vulture and Viper Mk IV dropships that have special searchlights and lightbars on the exterior.^[1]^ These flashing red/blue lights are not on standard system security ships.

According to the Codex they can pull up to arrest any criminals. 

If you kill security ships then Omnipol appear in high engineered ships.

If an on foot Settlement Defense mission is illegal, then the raiding troops are Omnipol. They arrive with ships that have police lights.^[2]^ Such illegal missions can be given by anarchy government factions.

Some Omnipol agents are corrupt and offer illegal missions.^[3]^

Sometimes, a security ship may scan your ship, and if you have a bounty related to his faction, they'll attack you. However, Omnipol only appears if you destroy local security ships.^[4]^

Omnipol usually does not attempt peaceful arrests. They'll try to kill their targets. You must pay your bounty at an interstellar faction or hand yourself in at the station. You'll go to prison and receive an impound tax on your ship.^[4]^

Omnipol officers are some of the best equipped and most well-trained soldiers around, possessing the finest equipment that money can buy. They are tough and can inflict much damage.

Omnipol agents are easily identified by their distinctive outfits, wearing dark blue plating over a white bodysuit. Their breastplate has 'OMNIPOL' emblazoned across the top center. The HUD displays a police badge icon next to their name, shield status, health, and security level readouts. The yellow badge icon shows the combat rank on the left side.
