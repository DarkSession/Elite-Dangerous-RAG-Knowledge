Capital Ship Dock - Facece - Topaz
 		 	 

A **Capital Ship Dock** is a specialised type of station where capital ships such as the Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser and the Majestic-Class Interdictor are constructed or undergo maintenance and repairs. They can accommodate up to two capital ships at once, but possess no Landing Pads for smaller ships. Some Capital Ship Docks are located in the vicinity of starports.
