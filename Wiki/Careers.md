Pilots and a Type-9 art
 		 	 

**Careers** can be performed by anyone with the necessary equipment. As a commander licensed by the Pilots Federation, you are a freelancer who can pursue any activity without prior experience nor skill. Careers can involve ship and on foot activities. You can roam the galaxy without restrictions except star systems that require a permit. Change the Core Systems by supporting a faction in Powerplay. Develop uninhabited star systems via colonisation. Roleplay in unscripted events. 

The Pilots Federation recognizes the main careers: combat, trader, explorer, CQC, Mercenary and Exobiologist. You gain ranks by doing activities related to these careers.

## Colonisation

    - *Main article: System Colonisation*

### System Architect

    - *Main article: System Architect* 	 	[![Space Depot ED](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/d/df/Space_Depot_ED.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20241031033518)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/d/df/Space_Depot_ED.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20241031033518) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Space Depot

The System Architect can colonize unpopulated star systems and develop them by building facilities such as a starport, planet port and settlement.^[1]^ The facilities determine the economy type like high tech or agribusiness. Create new civilizations and expand a faction's influence in the galaxy.

## Combat

    - *Main article: Combat*, *Thargoid Combat*

### Assassin

 	 	[![Assassin-Asp](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/1a/Assassin-Asp.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20171016143120)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/1a/Assassin-Asp.png/revision/latest?cb=20171016143120) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Assassin Asp
 		 	 

    - *Main article: Assassin*

An assassin requires flight experience and solid equipment as their targets are highly dangerous. The payout for taking down targets can be extremely rewarding, but make sure to never underestimate the enemy - their bounties are large for a reason.

### Bounty Hunter

 	 	[![Bounty Hunter FDL](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/1b/Bounty_Hunter_FDL.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20170205204851)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/1b/Bounty_Hunter_FDL.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170205204851) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Bounty Hunter Fer-de-Lance
 		 	 

    - *Main article: Bounty Hunter*

Space is a rough place and there are plenty of pirates in the anarchy systems who need to be retired. The bounty hunter takes advantage of the in-game bounty system, earning credits and combat rank for destroying wanted ships. Bounty hunters specialise in lethal, offensively-focused ships which are capable of reliably destroying their prey.

### CQC Pilot

 	 	[![Elite-Dangerous-CQC-Championship](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/b0/Elite-Dangerous-CQC-Championship.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20170707045156)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/b0/Elite-Dangerous-CQC-Championship.png/revision/latest?cb=20170707045156) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
CQC Championship
 		 	 

    - *Main article: CQC*

CQC (Close Quarter Combat) is an arena combat simulation by Utopixx Entertainment. This is separate from the main galaxy*.* Pilots can compete in 3 game modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag. Flyable ships are the Eagle, Sidewinder, F63 Condor and the Imperial Fighter which can be customized with loadouts. CQC ranks are officially recognized by the Pilots Federation.

### Mercenary

 	 	[![Mercenary Cobra](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/3/39/Mercenary_Cobra.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20170205204418)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/3/39/Mercenary_Cobra.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170205204418) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Mercenary Cobra
 		 	 

    - *Main article: Mercenary*

Ship-based mercenary work can be found at a starport's mission board, and send the player to fight at Conflict Zones and warzones. In zones with active fighting a mercenary can find near constant work.

Mercenary
 		 	 

On Foot mercenary missions involve settlements at Concourses across the galaxy. Missions involving raids, infiltration and simple repair work are available via the Concourse Terminals. Commanders looking to make more credits can accept shadier missions from recruiters. Mercenaries may enlist with Frontline Solutions to participate in local Conflict Zones and to help a faction expand its control.

### Pirate

 	 	[![Pirates in rings](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/1e/Pirates_in_rings.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20150607215633)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/1e/Pirates_in_rings.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150607215633) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Pirates in a planetary ring
 		 	 

    - *Main article: Pirate*

Pirates naturally earn combat ranking by attacking and destroying other ships. The primary motivation for pirates is the cargo carried by their prey. Pirates use powerful weaponry and their fearsome reputations to encourage traders to hand over their goods. They can employ hatch-breaker limpets which, when fired at an un-shielded target, will latch onto the cargo hatch and extract cargo canisters. In addition, once shields are dropped a pirate can shoot the cargo hatch manually to damage it which has the same effect, but this requires more skill. 

### Xeno Hunter

 	 	[![Thargoid Return Battle](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/e/e4/Thargoid_Return_Battle.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20240515040102)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/e/e4/Thargoid_Return_Battle.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20240515040102) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Thargoid battle
 		 	  

    - *Main article: Xeno Hunter*

A Xeno Hunter is specialized in combat vs Thargoids. All Thargoids have nearly maximum damage resistance, and require AX weapons or Guardian weapons. Thargoid Scouts are the weakest with only 77% human weapons resistance. Meanwhile, Thargoid Titans are capital ship that are best dealt with in teams. Thargoid can deal caustic damages, so the Decontamination Limpet Controller or Caustic Sink Launcher is advised. Overheating your ship can clear caustic damage, though it requires to overheat your ship to a super high temperature between 180%-220%.

## Covert

### Infiltrator

 	 	[![DataPointSettlement](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/79/DataPointSettlement.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20151216013644)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/79/DataPointSettlement.png/revision/latest?cb=20151216013644) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Data Point at a settlement
 		 	  

    - *Main article: Infiltrator*

Infiltrator jobs can be found at various mission boards and require the player to attack or covertly retrieve or steal data packages from a target settlement. Infiltrators are often tasked with attacking a certain quantity of a specific settlement's skimmers, destroying settlement's power grid or obtaining a data package by scanning a settlement's data points via the data link scanner.

## Exploration

### Exobiologist

 	 	[![Tussock Ignis](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/bd/Tussock_Ignis.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20210527012541)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/bd/Tussock_Ignis.png/revision/latest?cb=20210527012541)

    - *Main article: Exobiologist*

The Exobiologist career involves discovering and cataloguing alien life forms. Exobiology is performed on foot with a Genetic Sampler to collect samples from alien flora and fauna. The collected samples can be sold to Vista Genomics. If commanders identify an unknown species then Vista Genomics will credit them with the discovery.

### Explorer

 	 	[![Beyond Exploration improvements](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/8/8e/Beyond_Exploration_improvements.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20171008043254)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/8/8e/Beyond_Exploration_improvements.png/revision/latest?cb=20171008043254) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Explorer
 		 	 

    - *Main article: Explorer*, *Sightseeing*

Exploring involves finding and scanning planetary bodies. Explorers can earn credits and increase their rank by making pioneering jumps to unexplored star systems, gathering data on planets, stars and other points of interest within systems. Exploration data can be sold at the Universal Cartographics of Starport Services. The first player who sells data about a celestial body will be credited in-game with a "Discovered By" tag on the Galaxy Map. These bodies can still be mapped, albeit for a lower reward. Alternatively, explorers can go sightseeing of beautiful star systems in the Milky Way. 

## Mining

### Miner

 	 	[![Type 9 mining](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/1e/Type_9_mining.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20170522183250)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/1e/Type_9_mining.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170522183250) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Miner Type-9 Heavy
 		 	 

    - *Main article: Miner*

Mining involves using various specialised tools to locate resource-rich asteroids, extracting and refining various raw minerals and metals from those asteroids, and then selling the collected commodities for the highest possible profit. Although more time-consuming and manual than simple trading, the number of tools available to miners allow for a more custom approach to the task, and massive profits can be earned depending on what mineral is collected and where it is sold.

### Salvager

 	 	[![Salvager-Type-9-Limpet](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/d/d5/Salvager-Type-9-Limpet.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20170207140226)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/d/d5/Salvager-Type-9-Limpet.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170207140226)

    - *Main article: Salvager*

A salvager is a career to retrieve items such as commodities, data and materials. These are found in space, at salvageable wrecks or on celestial bodies (planets, moons). Whether retrieving an item is legal or not can be seen by the GUI text that appears when targeting it - either "Legal Salvage" or "Illegal Salvage".

### Squadron

 	 	[![Elite-Dangerous-Squadron-Ships](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/5a/Elite-Dangerous-Squadron-Ships.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20181102101152)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/5a/Elite-Dangerous-Squadron-Ships.png/revision/latest?cb=20181102101152) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Squadron
 		 	 

    - *Main article: Squadron*

The squadron is a player group that is created and managed by players. Members can setup a hierarchy with ranks. Squadron leaders can set objectives an custom activities. Such as mining, trading, Xeno Hunter, Powerplay and colonisation. Each squadron can support a Minor Faction or Power. The Squadron Carrier has a bank for credits, commodities, personal items, goods, assets and ships. 

## Trading

### Smuggler

 	 	[![Orbis-Station-Planet-Type-6](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/d/d6/Orbis-Station-Planet-Type-6.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20170624034247)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/d/d6/Orbis-Station-Planet-Type-6.png/revision/latest?cb=20170624034247) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Smuggler Type-6
 		 	 

    - *Main article: Smuggler*

Smugglers are similar to traders except that they sell goods where it is illegal, on the black market. Smugglers have to use stealth, cunning and special equipment to outwit the Police and sometimes military authorities, especially around stations, to sell their goods at a profit while escaping fines and a criminal record. Smugglers can also be a special class of couriers, where the player is asked to transport forbidden items.

### Trader

 	 	[![Type-9-Heavy-Coriolis-Station](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/0/09/Type-9-Heavy-Coriolis-Station.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20180901165529)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/0/09/Type-9-Heavy-Coriolis-Station.png/revision/latest?cb=20180901165529)

    - *Main article: Trader*

Trading is the act of buying commodities at a low price and selling them for a higher price. In Elite: Dangerous the Galaxy Map can help traders determine profitable trade routes by providing purchasable market data as well as displaying NPC trade routes and economy types. Hauling cargo around the galaxy attracts pirates. Pirates are a hazard depending on the star system.

## Transportation

### Courier

 	 	[![Courier-Role 2](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/56/Courier-Role_2.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20170326204858)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/56/Courier-Role_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170326204858) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Courier career
 		 	 

    - *Main article: Courier*

A Starport Mission Board usually offers missions that require little or no cargo space and can be an easy (albeit low) source of income. Missions that require no cargo space will be marked with one horizontal arrow pointing right whereas courier missions that require some cargo space are marked with a cargo container and an arrow pointing to the right. Missions that have two horizontal arrows going left and right require you to buy the stated cargo and return to the port with it. Accepted missions can be turned in (completed) by travelling to the mission's destination and using the starport mission board there.

### Passenger Carrier

 	 	[![Beluga-Liner-Planetary-Ring](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/d/dc/Beluga-Liner-Planetary-Ring.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20170727160520)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/d/dc/Beluga-Liner-Planetary-Ring.png/revision/latest?cb=20170727160520)

    - *Main article: Passenger Carrier*

Passenger Carriers are similar to Traders except they transport paying passengers instead of cargo. Passenger contracts operate in a similar manner to mission board contracts. Ships that are equipped with Passenger Cabins may pick up passengers in the Passenger Lounge available at many stations. There are two main types of passenger contracts: VIP and non-VIP (bulk).

### Search and Rescue

 	 	[![Station Attack interior](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/c/cc/Station_Attack_interior.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20171218224057)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/c/cc/Station_Attack_interior.png/revision/latest?cb=20171218224057)

    - *Main article: Search and Rescue*

The Search and Rescue career concerns providing assistance in emergency situations. Certain Legal Salvage items, such as escape pods (occupied or damaged), "black box" flight recorders, and personal effects, can be turned in to a station's Search and Rescue Agent contact for a reward. Damaged stations offer passenger missions to evacuate refugees to the nearest Rescue Vessel, and Rescue Vessels offer missions to salvage items from inside damaged stations.

## Utility

### Support

    - *Main article: Support*

 	 	[![Cobra-Repair-Limpet](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/7f/Cobra-Repair-Limpet.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20171016131947)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/7f/Cobra-Repair-Limpet.png/revision/latest?cb=20171016131947) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Cobra MkII and a repair limpet
 		 	 

Support is an informal career in which one player aids another by refueling their ship or repairing its hull. This can be accomplished with Fuel Transfer Limpets for refuels, Repair Limpets for hull repairs and Beam Lasers engineered with Regeneration Sequence to restore shields. While this career does not guarantee any monetary reward, it can be an interesting and entertaining pursuit on its own. Many explorers often find themselves in need of fuel or repairs while wandering the far reaches of the galaxy, and combat ships can benefit from hull repairs both during and after a battle.
