## Types

### Surface Recon Vehicles

There are two SRV models manufactured by Vodel: the Scarab and the Scorpion.

| Image | Name | Type | Seats | Multicrew | Cargo Capacity | Top speed | Manufacturer | CollapseCost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | Scarab | Exploration | 1 | No | 4 t | 40 m/s | Vodel | 5,270 CR |
|  | Scorpion | Combat | 2 | Yes | 2 t | 32 m/s | Vodel | 24,863 CR |

A Surface Recon Vehicle (SRV) is a terrestrial rover. One or more SRVs can be carried by ships that are equipped with a Planetary Vehicle Hangar. Planetary gravity affects the handling of SRVs, requiring pilots to take care when driving to avoid damaging collisions or unintentionally launching into extreme jumps. If the pilot's SRV is destroyed, they will return to their ship, whether it is still parked on the surface or has automatically returned to orbit. Any damage sustained by an SRV is automatically repaired upon returning to the ship. SRV fuel and ammunition can be synthesized as needed, provided the pilot has the necessary materials.

### Skimmers

Skimmers are small, remotely-piloted surface vehicles that hover at low altitudes over a planet's surface. They usually guard Settlements and Shipwrecks. Skimmers cannot be used by players.

An Exopod is a single-pilot space utility vehicle designed for short excursions in localized areas of space, such as carrying components around Capital Ship Docks.^[1]^ At present, Exopods are not available for purchase.

Frontier made concept art of vehicles that are not available in ED.^[2]^ These vehicle concepts are much larger than the Scarab and specialized.^[2]^

## Notes

- Originally there were plans for additional classes of SRVs to be released during *ED: Horizons*, but they did not materialise before the next expansion *ED: Odyssey*. In 2016 during an AMA, David Braben was asked *"is there an ETA for planetary mining? and will we get a special SRV for that purpose"* Braben said *"No ETA yet, but it is planned."*^[3]^
- Files datamined from the *ED: Odyssey* alpha hinted at two additional SRV models, the Scorpion and the Rhino. The Scorpion was officially released with *ED: Odyssey* Update 9.^[4]^
