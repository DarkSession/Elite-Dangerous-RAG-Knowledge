# Hardpoint
AÂ **Hardpoint** is a mounting position on a ship where weapons are placed with the intention of being deployed only when in use. Hardpoints are usually manually-deployed from within the ship's hull when needed, but some automatically deploy when in normal space.

Hardpoints for weapons on ships come in multiple sizes: Small, Medium, Large, and Huge, with the corresponding classes of 1 through 4. 

## Notes

- Deployed hardpoints will prevent a ship from charging up their Frame Shift Drive.
- A hardpoint may accept any weapon of equal or lower class.
- The amount of hardpoints on a ship cannot be changed through any means of engineering, modifications, or outfitting.
- The size of hardpoints cannot be changed by anything in outfitting, engineering, or modifications either.
