**Luchtaine** is an Independent system in the Colonia Region within the Inner Scutum-Centaurus Arm. It was originally colonised on June 26, 3303 by the minor faction Luchtaine Forge, which constructed first Moore's Charm and then Neugebauer Mines a month later on July 26, 3303. The Engineer Mel Brandon established his workshop, The Brig, in Luchtaine on August 28, 3304.
