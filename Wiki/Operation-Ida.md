**Operation Ida** is an independent player group and Player Minor Faction that focuses on station repairs. Created in 3304 and headquartered in Pleiades Sector HR-W d1-41, Operation Ida was founded due to an overwhelming need to repair stations that were attacked by Thargoids in the Pleiades Nebula. Stations that are attacked by Thargoids or humans require specific commodities (anywhere from 200,000 to 2,500,000 tons) to bring the station back online. Operation Ida specializes in organizing mass repair efforts and coordinating thousand of haulers to bring commodities to stations with the goal of repairing the station and restoring its services. As of April 3307, Operation Ida has conducted 167 repair efforts in the Pleiades, Core Systems, Witch Head Nebula, and the Coalsack Nebula, and consists of 1,558 player haulers who have collectively hauled over 94 million tons of commodities.

> “Recent reports indicate that several starports in the Pleiades have been attacked by Thargoids. The attacks have resulted in significant damage and hundreds – possibly thousands – of deaths.” - Galnet “Galactic News: Starports Attacked by Thargoids” December, 15, 3303^[1]^

On December 15, 3303, humanity experienced the first wave of Thargoid attacks on its orbital stations. Situated in the Pleiades Nebula, the first attacked stations included Titan's Daughter - Taygeta, Liman Legacy - HIP 16753, and The Oracle - Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55, which were recently established in the Pleiades by Aegis.^[2]^ Independent commanders and player groups scrambled to begin the process of repairing these stations, but it was proving difficult given the sheer demand of commodities (each station requiring anywhere from 8 to 23 million tons of cargo). Operation Ida was formed three months later in order to focus repair efforts on stations and strategically select stations to repair the Pleiades. With the help of a reduction of required commodities by Frontier (as much as a 90% reduction in overall tonnage), Operation Ida was able to successfully repair their first station, The Oracle, on March 1, 3304. Following the repair of The Oracle, Operation Ida began strategically repairing the many damaged stations in the Pleiades, focusing on refinery stations in order to guarantee a local supply of the station required commodities. On March 25, 3305, one year and three months after the Pleiades were first attacked, Operation Ida completed the repair of all stations in the Pleiades. 

After the completion of repairs in the Pleiades, Operation Ida turned its efforts to other sectors of the galaxy that were decimated by the Thargoids. This included the Bubble, the Witch Head Nebula, and Coalsack Nebula. After several campaigns within these locations, including returns to the Pleiades to repair newly damaged stations, Operation Ida completed the last remaining damaged stations on July 20, 3306. The completion of all station repairs was widely celebrated throughout the entire galaxy and even featured in the Elite newsletter.^[3]^

Rest from repairing the galaxy’s stations did not last long. Two months later on September 10, 3306, more stations were attacked. This time not by Thargoids, but by humans^[4]^. The new wave of station attacks were claimed by the NMLA group, described as “a paramilitary force of political extremists.” Stations attacked by NMLA were fully repaired on November 26, 3306. 

Two more waves of station attacks occurred after the NMLA damaged stations were fully repaired. Thargoids attacked several stations in the Witch Head Nebula and Coalsack Nebula on January 7, 3307, which were fully repaired on January 26, 3307. The next waves of station attacks were another coordinated effort by NMLA on March 11, 3307 that targeted several Superpower stations (Federation, Alliance, Empire) and Independent stations.^[5]^ Dubbed the “‘Nine Martyrs Attack”, stations that were subsequently damaged were fully repaired on Match 29, 3307.
