The **Fuel Transfer Limpet Controller** is a type of Limpet Controller module that can program limpets to transfer quantities of fuel from a ship's Fuel Tank to the Fuel Tank of a targeted ship. This is most useful in refueling ships that do not have a Fuel Scoop installed or lack sufficient fuel to jump to scoopable star.

## Usage

Fuel Transfer Limpets allow pilots to exchange fuel between themselves in situations where access to refueling is limited or nonexistent. The most common application is in the Support role made famous by the Fuel Rats, in which one pilot provides aid to another in need to prevent the loss of their ship.

In Wings, one member can be designated as a dedicated fuel carrier and fly a large ship with multiple reserve Fuel Tanks. The fuel carrier can keep the other members fueled and thus allow them to specialize for combat or other roles without setting aside internal compartments for a Fuel Scoop or reserve Fuel Tank themselves. This can extend the Wing's effective travel range and the activity time.
