The **E-Breach** is a consumable item that can be used to hack and override access panels at settlements without stealing an authorised profile or clone one with the Profile Analyser.

## Purchase

E-Breaches are relatively expensive consumables (vendors sell them for 25,000 CR). Due to their illegality, they can only be purchased at Pioneer Supplies locations at ports controlled by Anarchy or Communism minor factions. 

## Usage

 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Using an E-Breach to shut down a settlement's reactor core
 		 	 

These illegal items cause NPC personnel to react negatively if they detect you holding or using it.^[1]^^[2]^ Hacked terminals can cause NPCs to go into a suspicious/yellow alert state even if they do not see the player actively using the E-Breach on it. It was introduced in *ED: Odyssey*.

E-Breaches are the only way to open electronically-locked crates found at crash sites, Irregular Markers, and similar Points of Interest, as these crates cannot be cut open with the Arc Cutter and there are no computer consoles nearby to retrieve access codes from.
