The Engineered FSD V1 is a long range, fast boot FSD.  The blueprint used for this drive speeds up boot times and gives longer range jumps, at the cost of module integrity, power draw, thermal load and higher mass.

## Engineering

This module cannot be modified by Engineers to enhance its abilities.

## Unlocking

Unlocking requires the following Materials:

- 18 Datamined Wake Exceptions
- 26 Tellurium
- 26 Electrochemical Arrays
- 28 Chemical Processors

## Notes

It can jump approx. 2-3 light years further than a regular 5A engineered FSD with Mass Manager experimental effect.
