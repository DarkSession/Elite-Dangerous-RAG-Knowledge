The **Thargoid Link**, formerly known as an **Unknown Link**, is a Thargoid object that can be found inside a Thargoid Surface Site. A Thargoid Link will drop from a distributor nodule in one of the Site's side chambers if a Thargoid Sensor is brought near it using an SRV. One Link is needed in order to activate the Thargoid Device in the Site's central chamber.

Thargoid Links can also be used to locate other Thargoid Surface Sites. After a Thargoid Device has been activated and its three Unknown Signals are acquired, take a Thargoid Link into space and jettison it, then play a Signal while nearby. The Thargoid Link will react to each Signal and point in the direction of a new Site.
