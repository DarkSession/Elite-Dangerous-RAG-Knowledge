Orbis Starports

**Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd** is an independent construction company that specialises in modifying Orbis Starports. In September 3306, Kavanagh Spaceframes partnered with Brewer Corporation to upgrade a number of refinery Outposts into Orbis Starports in order to increase access to markets selling Tritium. In April 3307, Kavanagh was contracted by the Kumo Crew to build five new Orbis starports across the galaxy to stimulate trade.

## Timeline

22 APR 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
An initiative by the Kumo Crew syndicate to construct new starports for increasing trade has ended successfully. Pilots delivered large quantities of ceramic composites, semiconductors, polymers and water purifiers to Gabriel Enterprise in the Harma system. Bounty vouchers were also offered to protect the shipments during transit. The Kumo Council has announced that rewards for both traders and bounty hunters are now available from Gabriel Enterprise via its loyal intermediaries, The Razor Whips. Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd will now fulfil its contract and construct new Orbis starports. These will be in place on the 29th of April 3307 at the following locations:
Pegasi sector PN-T C3-14, near the Harma system
HIP 18390, near the California Nebula
HIP 10792, near the Sothis system
HIP 62154, in the Coalsack Nebula
Eol Prou PC-K c9-91, in the Colonia region
A statement from Archon Delaine was published by The Pegasi Sentinel: "I am pleased to see that our trade routes can now extend into fresh territories. My people will be very grateful, I'm sure. What pleases me less is the huge number of criminal scum that tried to disrupt the project. This has forced me to invent some very creative reprisals, which I look forward to inflicting shortly."^[1]^

15 APR 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
The Kumo Crew syndicate has launched an initiative to construct up to five starports to stimulate galactic trade. Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd, an independent construction company, has been privately contracted by the Kumo Council to build fully operational Orbis stations. These will be located in uninhabited systems close to key trading regions and areas of commercial interest. The Pegasi Sentinel newsfeed featured this statement from Archon Delaine: "As sovereign ruler of the Kumo nation, it's my responsibility to increase prosperity for the systems under my protection. My new starports will extend our reach and boost trading of all kinds... legitimate and otherwise. I have also placed bounties on the heads of anyone who dares to interfere with my plans. The one thing we never trade in is mercy." The Razor Whips, one of Delaine's loyal factions, is organising the campaign. It will reimburse pilots who deliver ceramic composites, semiconductors, polymers and water purifiers to Gabriel Enterprise in the Harma system. The number of new starports will depend on the quantity of deliveries. The targeted locations are:
Pegasi Sector PN-T c3-14, near the Harma system
HIP 18390, near the California Nebula
HIP 10792, near the Sothis system
HIP 62154, in the Coalsack Nebula
Eol Prou PC-K c9-91, in the Colonia region^[2]^

01 OCT 3306

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders\*
New starports constructed in ten systems causing increased commodity demand.
Several refinery outposts have now been upgraded to starports, following an initiative to improve access to large ships for refuelling fleet carriers. Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd has completed construction of the following Orbis starports:
Harper Plant in the Fjorgyn system
Iqbal Hub in the HR 4979 system
Stephenson Dock in the Wolf 294 system
McQuarrie Landing in the Lambda-2 Tucanae system
Hartsfield Plant in the Potriti system
The following Coriolis starports have been constructed by Steel Castle Inc:
Rorschach Hub in the LHS 4058 system
Chargaff Installation in the Chakpa system
Nagata Vision in the Gally Bese system
Reilly Plant in the Eta Cephei system
Trevithick Vision in the Ninabin system
As a result of the community drives to build these starports, there have been fluctuations on the trading market. The availability of several commodities has been reduced, resulting in increased prices and profit margins. The items affected include:
Bauxite
Building fabricators
Gallite
Power generators
Rutile
Thermal cooling units^[3]^

21 SEP 3306

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders\*
New starports to be constructed in 10 systems.
Two projects to resource the upgrading of refinery outposts into starports have concluded. The aim is to increase efficiency for fleet carrier owners who use large ships for transporting tritium fuel. Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd published this statement from CEO Susannah Haynes: "Thanks to a generous number of deliveries, we will have in place fully functioning Orbis starports for the start of October in the Fjorgyn, HR 4979, Wolf 294, Lambda-2 Tucanae and Potriti systems. All participating traders can now collect their rewards at Blaauw Hub in the Tenche system." A similar announcement came from Dean Bradigan, director of Steel Castle Inc: "The many shipments that we received will enable us to provide new Coriolis stations in the LHS 4058, Chakpa, Gally Bese, Eta Cephei and Ninabin systems by the beginning of October. We hope these will provide services to travellers for many years to come. Rewards for all pilots who delivered these minerals are now available at Teng-hui Station in the Nagasairu system."^[4]^

17 SEP 3306

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders\*
Trading commodities required in Nagasairu and Tenche systems.
Two construction companies have requested materials to convert refinery outposts into starports, to assist owners of fleet carriers who use large vessels for tritium refuelling. Susannah Haynes, CEO of Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd, stated: "With the galactic community's help, we can upgrade a maximum of five outposts into Orbis starports. Our intermediaries, Tenche Universal Holdings, will accept deliveries of building fabricators, power generators and thermal cooling units at Blaauw Hub in the Tenche system." There were similar requests from Dean Bradigan, director of Steel Castle Inc: "For travellers who find the familiar sight of Coriolis stations welcoming, here's a chance to build up to five more. We ask for shipments of bauxite, gallite and rutile to be delivered to CQC Holdings at Teng-hui Station in the Nagasairu system." The number of starports will depend on the amount of materials delivered. The target systems in order of priority are Fjorgyn, HR 4979, Wolf 294, Lambda-2 Tucanae, Potriti, LHS 4058, Chakpa, Gally Bese, Eta Cephei and Ninabin. If successful, upgrading will be done for the start of October. Both initiatives begin on 17th September 3306 and will run for one week. If the final targets for a campaign are met earlier than planned, it will end immediately.^[5]^

11 SEP 3306

- A press release from Brewer Corporation discusses plans to improve access to refuelling for owners of fleet carriers. "We have been surprised and gratified by the popularity of our latest product. The options for independent pilots and crews have been considerably expanded by the versatility and capability of our Drake-Class Carriers. But we have also listened to customers' concerns, in particular that large ships such as Anacondas, Corvettes and Clippers cannot dock with refinery outposts to take on Tritium fuel. To help alleviate this issue, Brewer Corporation has partnered with two independent construction firms: Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd and Steel Castle Inc. They are tasked with upgrading a number of outposts into fully functioning starports, in order to make refuelling runs more efficient." The two construction companies that won this contract both have impressive track records in modifying orbital habitats. Kavanagh Spaceframes specialises in Orbis starports, while Steel Castle exclusively works with Coriolis designs. The projects are expected to begin next week.^[6]^
