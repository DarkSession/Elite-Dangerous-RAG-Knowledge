**Mastopolos Mining** is an Imperial mining mega corporation. Founded in 2951 by Senator Giya Mastopolos of the Mastopolos family to resolve a major resource shortage afflicting the Empire, the corporation has since grown into an industrial behemoth with operations throughout Imperial, Alliance, and independent space. It is the main rival of Wreaken Corporation, which has a major presence in Federal systems. In the 34th century, Mastopolos Mining is led by CEO Gabriella Mastopolos. Gabriella's cousin, Senator Zemina Torval, was the majority shareholder in the company until October 3307, when she sold half of her shares and reinvested the money into Torval Mining Ltd, an autonomous branch that the senator founded and then spun off into an independent company for the benefit of her own family.

## History

### Mastopolos Family

The Mastopolos family were originally from Achenar and several members rose to positions of significant senatorial power in the system. However, in 2951, the major interest of Giya Mastopolos lay in solving an Imperial resource crisis and so he financed an expeditionary flotilla into the Zeaex system, empowering Erronsa and Francis Ashfield in their conflict over mining rights with Grambourne Cambridge of the Federation.^[2]^ Giya later took direct control of the mining operations, and under his and his daughter Niya's guidance, Mastopolos Mining rapidly expanded. The company has been under the control of the Mastopolos dynasty ever since.

After the death of her husband, Duke Mastopolos, Gabriella Mastopolos assumed control of the Corporation and guided it to new prosperity. Duke's frivolous ways were quickly forgotten as the organisation ventured out of the Imperial heartlands and courted new contracts with Alliance affiliated systems, even winning business tenders in Alioth.^[2]^

### Gabriella Mastopolos' Leadership

Mastopolos has recently lost out to Wreaken Mining and Construction over the tantalum extraction rights in Tiliala. They have, however, taken over administration of Jenning's Hollow in Enayex, where Imperial prisoners operate tantalum mines. There were some concerns over the Corporation's ability to manage the unruly prison workforce, but following a direct presentation by Gabriella herself, conditions improved dramatically.^[3]^

Mastopolos Mining has grown to be a major mining force, particularly in Imperial space, occasionally competing directly with WCM. It has its own force of loyal slaves who are treated very well according to Imperial rules (something that Gabriella Mastopolos, now in her 90s, widely insisted upon, and regularly visits installations to do personal spot checks). Slaves leave at the end of their assigned terms with a generous bonus (calculated based on their productivity during their term), over and above their required payout under Imperial law. This means the workforce work hard and diligently - and also increases the number of people signing up for such service.^[3]^

### Mastopolos Mining Interests

Mastopolos Mining is highly rated to do business with. Despite its name, the corporation has broad interests, mostly in and around Imperial space. It operates a fleet of large transport ships - initially to transport its own raw materials around and to supply its mining installations, but it has extended this to carry other goods too. It now runs three whole systems as corporate states, operating its own law (close to Imperial law), and policed by its own security service. It also has a large number of outposts dotted around, covered by the same security service.^[4]^

It operates its own navy based around its security service, using a small number of Imperial cruisers in company colours, together with a fleet of cutters. These tend to deal with pirate incursions, and escort its transport when outside 'civilised' space, while the security service deals with personal issues 'on the ground'.^[4]^

## Subsidiaries

### Maausk and Sorbago branches

Mastopolos Mining has two major branches: Maausk Mastopolos Mining Inc in the Maausk system, and Sorbago Mastopolos Mining Inc in the Sorbago system. The Maausk branch is considered one of Mastopolos Mining's flagship operations.^[5]^

The Sorbago branch was embroiled in a major Imperial slave rebellion that began on December 16, 3300. Senator Zemina Torval sent two of her Majestic-Class Interdictors to Sorbago under the pretext of guarding the system from foreign provocateurs, but it was rumoured that the ships were being used to help Sorbago Mastopolos Mining Inc crush the revolt.^[6]^ Torval funded a campaign to purchase slaves that independent pilots obtained from Sorbago in order to expand Mastopolos Mining's labour force.^[7]^ However, the rebellion gained steam with the aid of smuggled weapons shipments, and the slaves seized most of the mines on Sorbago A 1 and massacred their managing personnel on December 20.^[8]^ It took another five days for Mastopolos forces and independent pilots to contain the rebellion.^[9]^ The ringleaders were captured and executed, and Torval asserted that the entire affair had been instigated by agitators from the Federal system of Luluwala.^[10]^^[11]^

### Torval-Mastopolos Mining

    - *Main article: Torval Mining Ltd*

Senator Zemina Torval, the majority shareholder of Mastopolos Mining, founded an autonomous branch under her sole control on August 10, 3307. The new Torval-Mastopolos Mining corporation offered similar mining and transportation services as its parent company, and was reportedly intended by Senator Torval as a way to burnish her legacy for her children. It was also rumoured that Torval had been attempting to take on a more visible role in Mastopolos Mining, but this may have caused a falling out between her and her cousin, CEO Gabriella Mastopolos.^[12]^ Torval-Mastopolos Mining established temporary headquarters on the planet Dini in LTT 198 on August 16, and one of Senator Torval's daughters, Constantia Torval, was appointed director of operations.^[13]^^[14]^ On September 3, the branch opened the starport Torval Orbital, which became its permanent administrative headquarters. Rather than celebrate Torval-Mastopolos Mining's achievements, Gabriella Mastopolos accused the branch of stealing her family's name, and Adrian and Elena Mastopolos cast doubt on Constantia Torval's business competence.^[15]^

The rift between the Torvals and Mastopoloses continued to widen, and Gabriella planned to oust Zemina as Mastopolos Mining's controlling shareholder. Unexpectedly, the senator acquiesced and sold off half of her shares with little resistance, then reinvested the money into Torval-Mastopolos Mining. As that news broke on October 1, 3307, Constantia Torval also announced that Torval-Mastopolos Mining had been elected the new controlling faction of LTT 198 and had obtained the system's permit holder rights from LTT 198 State Ltd.^[16]^ Senator Torval finally severed Torval-Mastopolos Mining from its parent company on October 8, rebranded it Torval Mining Ltd, and assumed the role of its CEO. The newly independent mining corporation was able to acquire substantial assets from Mastopolos Mining in the process because shares between the two were legally transferable.^[17]^
