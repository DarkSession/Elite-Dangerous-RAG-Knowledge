There will be developers and the community together featuring special guest speakers, exclusive panel sessions, events, presentations, competitions, hands-on gameplay and much more. 

Alongside the aforementioned demonstrations and panels, so-called "world-leading experts" are scheduled to explore the "real-world science and discovery behind Frontier’s games", which sounds particularly interesting.^[2]^
