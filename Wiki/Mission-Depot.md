# Mission Depot
Mission Depot
 		 	 

The **Mission Depot** is a menu where pilots can collect and deliver cargo for trading missions incrementally and view their progress. It is available for both Team Missions and solo missions.^[1]^^[2]^

For trading missions, pilots can buy the necessary commodities directly through the Mission Depot if they are available, and make multiple delivery runs to fulfill the mission's requirements.^[3]^

Some missions have thousands of units. Most ships cannot carry that much cargo at once. The Mission Depot allows pilots to partially check out cargo and share it with others in their Team. Teammates can individually track their contributions.^[3]^

## Notes

- The Mission Depot was added in Chapter One (3.0) of *Elite Dangerous: Beyond*. It was initially exclusive to Wing Missions, but Chapter Three (3.2) enabled it for solo missions as well.^[2]^
- Wings were renamed to Teams in Odyssey.
