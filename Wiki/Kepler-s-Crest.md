# Kepler's Crest
**Kepler's Crest** is galactic region #41 in the Milky Way. It is bordered by Formidine Rift, Elysian Shore, Sanguineous Rim, Achilles's Altar, and Xibalba.

The region lies directly 'south' of the local bubble. Due to its location on the edge of the galaxy, the region contains large voids containing next to no stellar bodies. Attempting to fully explore this region will require the use of Frameshift Drive Injections, FSD Supercharging and/or Engineering due to the low number of stars in the region. The middle of the region contains a relatively dense section of stars which extends into Xibalba. The easiest way to access this section of stars without using Frameshift Drive Injections is to head to the 'northwestern' nub of the region which borders the Formidine Rift, Elysian Shore, and Sanguineous Rim where there are the highest number of stars.
