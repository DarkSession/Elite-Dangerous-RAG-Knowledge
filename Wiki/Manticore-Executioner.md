## Overview

A powerful slow fire plasma marksman rifle. The projectile's travel speed is slow so an "aware" NPC opponent will often actively "dodge" the shot. A player can easily strafe an incoming shot by walking sideways from fairly close distance.

For most NPCs, one shot is usually enough to bring down their shield while a second is enough to kill them. A notable exception is the Enforcer who can withstand 2 shots without their shield, or 3 shots if their shield is on.
