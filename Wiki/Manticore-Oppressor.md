## Overview

The Oppressor has a medium rate of fire and a relatively fast reload—however, it has a high amount of recoil and slow-traveling projectiles, making hitting moving targets difficult. In addition, the Oppressor has such a low damage output that its time-to-kill is slower than melee in some cases. Upgrading the weapon to Grade 5 improves its damage output by a fair margin, but it still pales in comparison to every other weapon.

The Oppressor is undoubtedly the worst on-foot weapon in the game and cannot perform anything that another weapon couldn't do better.
