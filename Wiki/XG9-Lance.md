> The Lance (XG9) is a direct successor to the Javelin (XG8), and like its predecessor it represents a fusion of human and Guardian technology. The fighter is both agile and fast, but it has a relatively light hull, so once its shields are down it is comparatively vulnerable. This model is equipped with an integrated gauss weapon.

## Overview

In contrast with human-manufactured Ship-Launched Fighters, the XG9 Lance is an all-rounder that relies on its unique Guardian weaponry. It is slightly slower than the F63 Condor, slightly less manoeuvrable than the Gu-97, and has significantly less armour than the Taipan, but its damage output is substantial, especially against Thargoid craft.

The Lance's Gauss Focus Cannon is a projectile weapon with the second highest damage-per-shot (94) of all three Guardian hybrid fighters. It has a moderate rate-of-fire and very high armor piercing, but limited ammo, high heat generation, and reduced effectiveness against shields. Of all Guardian fighter options, this makes the Lance the superior choice to inflict hull damage on Thargoid Interceptors. Against non-Thargoid targets that have much lower Armour Hardness values, however, the Lance is less efficient than the other two Guardian hybrid fighters, especially the XG7 Trident.

Be aware that during combat against a Thargoid Interceptor, its Thargon Swarms will prioritise any Ship-Launched Fighters in the area and quickly destroy them. Eliminate as many Thargon Swarms as possible before deploying a SLF to allow it focus on Thargoid ships unimpeded.

## Notes

- The XG9 Lance was introduced in the Chapter Three (3.2) update of *Elite Dangerous: Beyond*.
- The Lance's weapons initially had very high heat generation, causing it to rapidly over heat and destroy itself. This was later patched, and it is now capable of firing repeatedly without spontaneously combusting.
