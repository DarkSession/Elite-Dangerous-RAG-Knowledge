The **Missile Rack** is a weapon module that launches dumbfire, explosive-tipped missiles. When triggered, it fires out an unguided missile that will travel in a straight line in the direction of the HUD crosshairs and remain on that path until it strikes an object, or is itself shot down by weapons fire or a Point Defence Turret. Dumbfire missiles travel faster and inflict more damage than seeker missiles, and are most effective against the unshielded hulls of ships, but their lack of guidance makes them more challenging to use against smaller vessels.

Compared to most other ship-based weaponry, dumbfire missiles are also useful against ground targets in On Foot activities due to their high firepower, large area of effect, and relative ease of use. Guardian Sentinels in particular are quite vulnerable due to their lack of shielding.
