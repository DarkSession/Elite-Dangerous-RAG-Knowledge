> On the edge of human space there are few holiday destinations. Struck by Ad Pontes's exceptional natural beauty, few natural resources, and twelve orbiting ice moons, the first colonists saw the economic sense in preserving their discovery and advertising "The Planet of the Zodiac" as a place of relaxation and renewal. Exports are mostly keepsakes and items with dubious "ancient" spiritual power and heritage.
