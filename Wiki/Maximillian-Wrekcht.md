**Maximillian Wrekcht** was an Imperial Commander of the Imperial Navy's Fifth Fleet. Upon retiring, he was granted an Imperial letter of marque and took up work as a privateer. In 2913, Wrekcht attempted an audacious raid on the banking vaults on the planet Trouble in Andceeth, a Federal system. Using an Imperial cruiser with prototype engine mask, Wrekcht tried to bombard Trouble with asteroids, but Federal defence forces foiled the attack. It is believed that Wrekcht died in the ensuing battle.^[1]^
