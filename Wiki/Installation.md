Installation and Earth-like planet
 		 	 

**Installations** are orbital structures with various purposes. Unlike Starports and Outposts, they lack docking facilities, but are still popular gathering places for independent pilots of all walks of life. Some Installations are guarded by ships that open fire on trespassers. Installations appear on the Navigation panel when they are 1,000 ls or less away. They do not appear in the System Map.

## Interaction

The interaction with Installations is similar to Megaships.^[3]^

Initiating interactions:^[4]^

1. Installations need to be scanned with the Data Link Scanner before any of the interaction objects become interactive.
2. Doing so will release a scan pulse which highlights all interaction objects attached to the Installation.
3. Interaction objects are added to your Contacts panel and can be targeted and interrogated to discover how to interact with them.
4. Some of interactions utilise Limpets of various types to allow you to activate, deactivate, damage, hack or simply operate an item. While others can be shot or scanned to interact.

- Pilots can also undertake Scenario Missions at most Installations.

Most interactions are considered illegal. These interactions provide criminal pilots gameplay options as well as give lawful players new locations to find wanted pilots. 

- Players can scan certain revealed targets to uncover sub-targets. These can be interacted with in different ways depending on the type.^[5]^
- Players can damage generators to disable turrets.^[5]^
- Players can use Recon Limpets to activate data terminals and Comms Arrays.^[5]^
- Players can use Hatch Breaker Limpets to open a cargo bay.^[5]^

## Notes

- The *Elite Dangerous: Beyond* Chapter Two (3.1) update added Megaship interactions to Installations.^[3]^ This had been planned since at least March 2017, when Lead Game Designer Steve Kirby announced that Installations would gain gameplay functionality.^[6]^
