### Empire Accused of Power Grab in Federation’s Heart

**Imperials agents have been charged with attempting to seize political influence deep in Federal territory following the Battle of Sol.**

With the aftermath of the Thargoid Invasion still causing upheaval across populated space, there has been a marked effort by many factions to establish themselves in systems impacted by Titan Cocijo’s assault in December.

Sofia Trevino wrote a summary for the Federal Times:

“*In recent weeks there has been turmoil in Sol, as political, corporate and military interests come to terms with the impact of Titan Cocijo’s arrival – not to mention the civilian cost, with billions of refugees still displaced in surrounding systems*.”

“*But an unexpected element has emerged, with ports and outposts reporting a significant increase in positive Imperial sentiment. This has been tied to Princess Aisling Duval in particular, currently enjoying a good reputation among non-Imperial populations due to her work as a delegate to Aegis and a champion of humanitarian causes for those impacted by the xeno war*.”

“*Shadow-President Jerome Archer has stamped down on this flourishing popularity and was described as ‘outraged’ by the notion of Imperial influence in the heart of the Federation. Republican media outlets, counteragents and even the Proactive Detection Bureau were deployed to quell the initial unrest*.”

Princess Aisling has denied any involvement in the growth of Imperial support, but did imply that Federal populations ‘*should not be spurned for the consideration of new ideas*’.

It has been noted that a core of Aisling’s supporters remain active in Barnard’s Star, which no doubt concerns the Federal government.

### Anti-Xeno Blockade Contains HIP 22460

**A squadron of AX pilots have planned to sustain pressure on the lingering Thargoid presence in the HIP 22460 system.**

Led by the respected AXI and XSF combat fleets, the blockade seeks to push Thargoid craft from the area from January 12th.

HIP 22460 was the staging ground for Salvation’s Proteus Wave weapon, which sought to end the Second Thargoid War in August 3308 but resulted in disaster. Prior to this it is believed to have hosted several clandestine research operations hosted by Azimuth Biochemicals and protected by the notorious Black Flight.

More updates will be provided as the story develops.

### HIP 22460 Declared Free of Thargoids

**Aegis has confirmed that HIP 22460 shows zero sign of Thargoid activity following a blockade organised by AXI and XSF forces.**

It is theorised that the Thargoids have maintained a varying presence in the HIP 22460 system since at least 3303, due to reports recovered from the now-abandoned Fort Asch laboratory. After the Proteus Wave weapon in the system in 3308, Thargoids aggressively swarmed the system until recently.

But AX forces sought to change this over the past few weeks, and the signal from Aegis’ military advisor Aden Tanner indicates that the system is now fully under human control. Tanner himself provided a message of thanks:

“*The impeccable efforts of AXI, XSF and allied AX pilots have finally brought peace to one more system. I only wish I was young enough to join these heroes out on the front lines. These pilots have provided a great service to humanity, and all here at Aegis salute them*.”

### Powerplay Standings: January 3311

**This month’s analysis of the influence held by key figures in the core systems has arrived, courtesy of Conrad Sterling of Vox Galactica.**

His latest survey of system populations suggests the following five powers enjoy the largest sphere of influence:

Rank 1: Edmund Mahon – 1,403 systems

Rank 2: Aisling Duval – 1,383 systems

Rank 3: Arissa Lavigny-Duval - 1,269 systems

Rank 4: Yuri Grom - 995 systems

Rank 5: Li Yong-Rui - 724 systems

Vox Galactica will provide another update on the state of the powers next month.

### Titan Wreckage In Sol Draws Keen Interest

**The wreckage of Titan Cocijo far above Earth has attracted thousands of ships over the past several weeks.**

As extensively reported in December, a huge effort from the Federal Navy, the Pilots’ Federation and other independent pilots brought down the last remaining Thargoid Titan after it assaulted the Sol system. Titan Cocijo’s destruction was confirmed on December 18th 3310.

An excerpt from an article by Jason Nygaard of the Federal Times offered the following:

“*Thousands of ships have descended on the carcass of Titan Cocijo now that the caustic cloud left in the mothership’s wake has dissipated to less hazardous levels. Some seek to claim a trophy of this military victory, while others seek to gain knowledge of Thargoid technology. Others still have been seen posing for selfies, using external camera modules to take the perfect snapshot for ICE channels*.”

“*Federal authorities had sought to limit the number of visitors to the site, citing military security and safety concerns. But with other Titan wreckages similarly popular, adventurous pilots have mostly ignored these protocols and there seems to be little appetite to enforce them*.”

A memorial beacon to remember those lost during the Second Thargoid War and the Battle of Sol has been deployed in the system.

### Brewer Corporation to Fund Survey Initiative

**A new planetary survey initiative has been announced by Brewer Corporation, calling for pilots to scan locations around the core systems.**

Following the recent deployment of the megaship Trailblazer Echo, CEO Madelyn Teague made the following announcement from the megaship’s bridge:

“*Recent events have accelerated plans to explore a new age of system colonisation efforts. Brewer Corporation has proudly supported ambitious projects such as the Colonia Bridge, and worked with other corporations to improve and increase starports across the galaxy. Now we take another step forward in the continued march across the stars*.”

“*Universal Cartographics has partnered with us to collect, analyse and process the very latest exploration data, to help calibrate our metrics for optimal colonisation targets*.”

Brewer Corporation, which constructs Coriolis and Orbis starports, has supported localised expansion efforts in the past. But, until today, it had given shareholders no sign that it would endorse widespread colonisation plans.

Some media analysts have claimed that Brewer Corporation has been in significant talks with superpower lobbyists in recent weeks, which could explain the change of heart. The level of influence the superpowers had on this announcement is unconfirmed.

Explorers who wish to contribute to the initiative can hand in exploration data to the Trailblazer Echo in the HIP 90578 system. Contributions will be valued by thoroughness, with full FSS scans and planetary probing completions rewarded higher.
