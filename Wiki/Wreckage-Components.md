**Wreckage Components** are a Salvage Commodity. They can be found in Salvageable Wreckage signatures close to planets and moons in certain systems. They are Illegal Salvage, so are considered stolen and can only be sold at Black Markets.

In December 3301, Sirius Corporation requested that pilots bring Wreckage Components to Davy Dock in the Procyon system for analysis. It was hoped that some of the recovered pieces might belong to the missing Highliner Antares and could be used to help determine its fate.^[1]^
