*Elite Dangerous* is the definitive massively multiplayer space epic, bringing gaming's original open world adventure to the modern generation with a connected galaxy, evolving narrative and the entirety of the Milky Way re-created at its full galactic proportions. Here is the **version history** of how it has evolved over time.

This page is a quick reference for the purpose of informing returning-CMDRs, after time away from the cockpit, of what has been added to Elite Dangerous and when. Provided are highlights of each release version - approximately 95% of the changelog information is omitted - therefore they are ordered as follows:

- Expansions bring key improvements - so are ordered chronologically, most recent first.
- Patches mostly fix bugs and correct balance issues that appeared - so are ordered by release-date, under their parent expansion.

Each release is briefly described on this page as follows:

- Version identifier, title of headline feature, and date publicly available
- Summary of the content, features and key gameplay improvements added
- Links to the complete changelogs (only ~5% is included here)
