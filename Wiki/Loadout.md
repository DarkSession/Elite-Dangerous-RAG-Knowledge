# Loadout
- *For CQC Championship fighter loadouts, see CQC Championship/Loadouts.*

The **Loadout** menu allows Commanders to create and equip different gear loadouts for On Foot activities. It can be accessed via Terminals at any Concourse, or the lower HUD panel while controlling a ship or SRV. Loadouts consist of a selected Suit and set of Handheld Weapons, and can be named to distinguish them at a glance. It is recommended to create a variety of Loadouts with different Suit and Weapon combinations with speciaised modifications to prepare for a range of encounters or activities.

## Notes

- The Loadout menu was introduced in *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*.
