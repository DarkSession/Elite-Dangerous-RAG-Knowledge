# Incendiary Rounds
**Incendiary Rounds** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to weapons through Engineering. It is a modified ammo system capable of delivering superheated rounds, converting 90% of damage to thermal, making the weapon more effective against shields, at the cost of a 5% decrease in rate-of-fire and tripling of weapon heat generated by firing.

## Applicability

This effect is available to the following weapons:

- Fragment Cannon
- Multi-cannon

## Required Materials

- 5x Heat Conduction Wiring
- 5x Phosphorus
