**New California** is an Earth-like World in Epsilon Eridani. It was terraformed by the Cisco Corporation (now WorldCraft) in 2958.^[1]^ The WorldCraft Theme Park is most popular among visitors.^[2]^

## WorldCraft Theme Park

Most come here for the WorldCraft Theme Park which was set up with no expense spared and costs a small fortune to visit. It is well worth it though, because you can live in a world of almost any fantasy you wish (something that has given it a reputation for seediness). If you want a break from the lushness outside, you can elect to stay for a day at the Ancient London Earth World of 1960 (where every effort has been made to make it as authentic as possible, it even has the stench of pollution).^[2]^

Every fantasy theme has its own complex which is self contained, with actors to help tourists play a part in adventures and feel that it is real.^[2]^

There are more wholesome themes on offer too. The War Veterans Trust maintains offices at Oliverport and runs the famous Museum of Armour and Ballistics on New California.^[2]^

It is a beautiful world with stunning panoramas everywhere; flowers, exotic trees, rivers and mountains have been carefully placed to be aesthetic. In fact it is so consistently picturesque that some people become distressed. When they are used to worlds with pockets of scenic beauty scattered amongst jungles of the urban type, it all gets a bit too much on New California where there isnâ€™t so much as a discarded vidicube wrapper in the verdant garden.^[1]^
