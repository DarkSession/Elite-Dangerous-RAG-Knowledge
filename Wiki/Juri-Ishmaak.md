## Notes

- The Combat Bonds requirement to meet Juri Ishmaak refers to the total number of bonds the player turns in. The value of each bond is irrelevant, but the player must side with Federal minor factions in Conflict Zones. Bonds must be turned in at stations in the systems where they are earned, not at Pater's Memorial.
