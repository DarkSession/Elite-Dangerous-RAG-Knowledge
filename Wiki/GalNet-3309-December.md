### Titan Taranis Surrounded

The star system Hyades Sector FB-N B7-6, which contains Thargoid Titan Taranis, has been surrounded by human forces.

Aden Tanner, special advisor to Aegis, provided the following update:

“Our pilots appear to have pushed Thargoids out of all systems in Titan Taranis’s area of control. It’s taken a huge effort, one which should rightly be recognised as outstanding. We don’t know for certain what will happen next. But for now, the region is back in humanity’s control.”

“I strongly urge pilots to keep fighting the Thargoid fleet wherever it is encountered. We must not become complacent - the Thargoids have surprised us before, and have demonstrated the ability to respond when defeat seems inevitable. Those who fought in the HIP 22460 campaign and witnessed the Proteus Wave event will testify to the dangers of assuming the war is won.”

Systems in the immediate vicinity, such as Hupang, Swahku and HR1737, have initiated repairs to starports which have been abandoned since November 3308. Titan Taranis itself remains largely resistant to conventional assault, and Hyades Sector FB-N B7-6 is still considered a Thargoid stronghold.

### Archer Outlines Shadow Presidency Future

Vice President Jerome Archer has discussed the recent Federal presidential election and other topics during an interview with The Federal Times.

On the victory of President-elect Felicia Winters:

“Winters fought a clean campaign based on issues, as I did, so one cannot fault her for that. But I think the harsh realities of governance will quickly overwhelm her liberal idealism. Hudson, whatever his critics may think of him, was never afraid to take decisive action. We’ll see if Winters can do the same.”

On Archer’s electoral policies:

“I maintain that a security-first approach is the correct one, given the many threats facing the Federation. The Thargoids are not the only enemy of our people. Dismantling the Proactive Detection Bureau, as Winters has threatened to do, will be an act of self-sabotage for our entire society.”

On his relationship with outgoing President Zachary Hudson:

“It’s been an honour to support President Hudson, from whom I have learned a great deal about the political arena. Both of us are genuine patriots with similar viewpoints. I know he will continue to serve the Federation in his own way.”

On his future political career:

“As shadow president, it will be my duty to not only scrutinise Winters’s administration, but also restore electoral faith in the Republican Party. I’m confident that the citizens will be fully on board with our policies by the next election, if not sooner.”

In response to this interview, an editorial in the Federal Free Press said:

“Jerome Archer’s priority now is to gather Hudson loyalists under his banner, and position himself as a worthy successor. But this tactic of talking about all subjects except his own lack of responsibility for the election loss will not fool voters. Once the PDB is gone, and we see the improvements wrought by a Liberal Party administration, Archer faces a considerable challenge to avoid becoming a footnote in the Federation’s history.”

### Spire Shutdown Confirms Thargoid Vulnerability

Professor Palin’s biological impurity has proved effective against the Thargoid spire sites, and is capable of halting their functionality.

Independent war reporter Gus LaChappelle published an on-the-scene report of the site in the Hyades Sector ST-Q B5-5 system for his ICE-cast channel Muzzle Flash:

“The eerie stillness surrounding me now is even more unnerving than when I visited this horror factory before. Bioluminescent nodules no longer pulse their sickly glow. Spires blot out the stars above, twisted towers made from solid night. Mega barnacles have ceased producing their foul byproducts. I’m walking through an alien cemetery.”

“The soldiers escorting me constantly perform pirouettes with their weapons, trigger-twitchy. But there are no black-hulled monstrosities spitting fire from the shadows or wheeling across the sky. Only rotted mineral sacs drooping from mechanical vines, and decaying chunks of necrotised metal. Even the nerve points that once triggered glandular responses have grown dull.”

Professor Shamus Madigan, Federal scientific liaison to Aegis, discussed these developments via Vox Galactica:

“Multiple pilots introduced Professor Palin’s contaminant into the supply lines for these spires, but it’s still remarkable how quickly it took effect. With large quantities of the contaminant in place, the Thargoids seem to have abandoned the site in Hyades Sector ST-Q B5-5. Perhaps maintenance drones were unable to keep the site viable for its purpose. Efforts are underway to repeat this success at other sites.”

“What this means for the Thargoid invasion fleets remains unclear as yet. If we are right and the Titans depend upon these biomechanical foundries, the loss of these sites may prove invaluable. But so far – though Taranis has lost control of surrounding systems – there is no evidence that the motherships have been affected by the spire sites’ inactivity.”

### Tionisla Materials Campaign Fails

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Councillor Nakato Kaine has announced that a delivery campaign in the Tionisla system has not reached its target.

Addressing the Alliance Assembly, she said:

“The purpose of this campaign was to demonstrate the core principles of the Alliance: independence, self-sufficiency and mutual support. While we received millions of units, our target quota was not filled. I believe there are important lessons to be learned here. We must not lose faith in the Alliance’s ability to remain self-sustaining in military infrastructure.”

The strategic defence pact between the Alliance and Sirius Corporation is being subjected to an independent inquiry. A vocal minority of councillors in the Assembly are critical of their corporate partner’s inability to deliver anti-xeno ships or activities.

Sirius Corporation CEO Li Yong Rui offered this comment to reporters:

“Sirius Corporation’s continued efforts to supply the Alliance Defence Force with upgraded modules and resources have been hampered by the Alliance Assembly in recent months. Kaine’s rogue operation in Tionisla only demonstrates how partisan some of us have become. If the defence pact had received unconditional support, just imagine what triumphs and successes Sirius might have delivered by now.”

The Alliance Rapid-reaction Corps has confirmed that pilots who earned bounty vouchers protecting traders can now collect their rewards from Brett High. The intended discount on the Alliance Challenger, Chieftain and Crusader has been cancelled due to the delivery campaign’s failure to reach its targets.

### Utopia Shares Update on Nemesis Failsafe

Simguru Pranav Antal has discussed Utopia’s analysis of the designs for a Guardian-based device allegedly constructed by Salvation.

The schematics for the Nemesis Failsafe were unearthed by Seo Jin-ae, who believed that Salvation had developed a way to digitise and relocate his mind upon physical death. Following concerns that Utopia was involved, Aegis shared these designs with the commune to confirm that there was no connection with their Sim-Archive technology.

Pranav Antal recently sent a message to Aegis, which has been made public with Utopia’s permission:

“After studying the designs intensively, our neurosmiths have gained some insights into the Nemesis Failsafe. Salvation’s unique knowledge of Guardian energy particles and their applications exceeds even our understanding. But we have formulated a theory about what happened when the ‘Nemesis protocol’ was activated aboard the Bright Sentinel megaship, shortly before its destruction in HIP 22460.”

“I would like to discuss this matter in person with Seo Jin-ae. Her unique experience with Salvation’s methods and independent research into his character may help me resolve some remaining questions.”

Vox Galactica’s science correspondent Leon Banerjee reported:

“The Nemesis Failsafe question is generally viewed with scepticism, if not outright mockery, among leading exoneurologists. Nobody disputes Salvation’s expertise at weaponising Guardian artefacts, but few believe that a living mind could be converted into electromagnetic pulses, even using alien technology.”

“Azimuth Biotech is also dismissive, not just about the science but the very idea that Salvation may have survived. Torben Rademaker has referred to it as ‘inappropriate and disrespectful to the memory of our founder Caleb Wycherley.’ Nevertheless, Aegis has agreed to transport Seo Jin-ae to meet Pranav Antal, if she accepts his invitation.”

### Help Harksing’s Gifts Reach Recipients

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The eccentric inventor Harald Harksing has been causing quite a stir on Angel Station in the Calhuacan system.

Recent reports suggest that the independent entrepreneur is experiencing problems with a corrupted database. This has prevented him from shipping his latest batch of inventions to their intended destinations. The commotion caused by his efforts to resolve the issue has brought both amusement and exasperation to the starport’s inhabitants.

Lishan Abara, culture correspondent for Vox Galactica, published a profile piece on Harksing:

“Little of Harald Harksing’s background has ever been confirmed. What is well known – indeed, highly publicised – is his annual sending of unusual gifts to individuals referenced in GalNet news articles. These mostly comprise of unique toys, gadgets or games that Harksing has designed and built himself, sometimes tailor-made for the recipient.”

“Those who receive Harksing’s inventions typically find them charming. The gourmet Giles Cappelleo, for example, was delighted by a chin-mounted palate-cleansing robot. Ambassador Delphine Dumont of the Federal Diplomatic Corps blushed when asked about the ‘Furry Yuri’ teddy bear that arrived at her office. And Archduke Otto Lombardo-Duval admitted that all twelve of his grandchildren adored a card game based on Imperial bloodlines called ‘Filial Pursuit’.”

“Harksing himself is always overjoyed at such positive responses. He often claims to be a huge fan of each person, describing them as ‘glorious’ or ‘kings in their field’. Such boyish enthusiasm, coupled with the odd nature of his creations, has made him a local celebrity in a short time.”

“Somewhat cynically, The Tau Ceti Journal described Harald Harksing as: ‘A calculating businessman who sends his prototypes to celebrities to secure endorsement and attract investors.’ While it is true that several manufacturers have offered contracts to mass-produce his less outlandish inventions, Harksing is more commonly viewed as a joyful and philanthropic figure.”

### Alliance Lifts Quarantine for Thargoid Abductees

The Alliance has ended medical isolation for all citizens who were rescued from the Titans after being abducted by Thargoid vessels.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon’s official declaration was published by all newsfeeds:

“The Assembly has agreed that quarantine procedures for everyone recovered from the Titans are no longer necessary. Those who hail from an Allied system are being transported from the secure facilities back to their families and communities. Their long nightmare is over. We are sending our people home.”

“I call upon the governments of the Empire, Federation and independent systems to follow our lead with their own citizens. We must not treat these unfortunates as criminals or laboratory specimens. During this dark time of war, let our humanity shine through.”

Some medical institutes such as Kamadhenu Medipure and Vandermeer Corporation opposed the Alliance’s decision, claiming that Imperial and Federal returnees should never be allowed back into the general population. Azimuth Biotech also repeated its offer to perform “cutting-edge xenological detection procedures on every human extracted from a Thargoid bio-storage capsule.”

The political dimension was analysed by Vanya Driscoll for The Alliance Tribune:

“Prime Minister Mahon knows that this will be a popular decision, after many public figures called the extended quarantine ‘inhumane’ and ‘barbaric’. Plus, with his rival Councillor Kaine currently questioning the wisdom of the Mahon-endorsed strategic defence pact with Sirius, the timing of this benevolent act could not be better.”

“On the wider political stage, asking the other superpowers to follow suit frames the Alliance as a more humanitarian society than its counterparts. This may be a rare occasion when the Empire and Federation are looking to us for moral guidance… or at least, waiting to see if sending home thousands of Thargoid abductees is a mistake.”

### Seo Jin-ae Departs Utopia in Silence

Seo Jin-ae has returned from a visit to Utopia following an invitation from Simguru Pranav Antal to discuss the possibility of Salvation’s survival.

The leader of the Utopia commune invited her to review the schematics that she recovered from an abandoned Azimuth Corporation facility in March. The schematics detailed a mysterious Guardian-based device named the Nemesis Failsafe. Seo Jin-ae believes this was used by Salvation to transfer his living mind to a remote location before his death in HIP 22460.

Aegis confirmed that it has no information about the meeting in Utopia, and that Seo Jin-ae refused to discuss the matter with them upon her return.

Pranav Antal transmitted a message that was shared across public newsfeeds:

“My sincere thanks to Seo Jin-ae for allowing me to explain my theories about Salvation’s ‘Nemesis protocol’. We have agreed not to disclose our conclusions. I must respect that Seo’s experiences with Salvation, along with her present goals, are very personal to her. It is my hope that Utopia’s findings are useful to her in some way.”

“A far more significant message that I would like to share concerns the increasing likelihood of humanity’s extinction. I speak not of the Thargoid war, but the ceaseless rivalries wrought by our innate tribalism. Now that our communities have become interstellar superpowers, this flaw in our nature could lead to the collapse of civilisation amid fire and ruin.”

“In the past, I have urged leaders to abandon militaristic posturing in favour of diplomacy. We must focus on what draws us together rather than our differences. Utopia will continue to serve as an exemplar of this philosophy, which may one day steer us toward a more holistic path.”

### Federation Extends Quarantine for Thargoid Abductees

Federal citizens who were captured by Thargoids then rescued from the Titans will not yet be permitted to leave secure medical facilities.

The decision comes after the Alliance ended quarantine restrictions for returnees from their systems, with newly rescued civilians expected to spend no more than a week in observation. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has called on other governments to do the same.

President Zachary Hudson discussed the situation during a press conference:

“The consensus of Federal medical experts is that it would be foolishly optimistic to allow these people – some of whom were held aboard the Titans for months – back into the general population. When at war with such an implacable enemy as the Thargoids, we simply cannot afford to take any risks.”

“Rest assured that Federal citizens are not suffering in any way. They are allowed to receive visitors, albeit without physical contact, and have full comms and media access. But they will remain under observation for the time being.”

President-elect Felicia Winters, whose term of office is due to begin early next year, explained her viewpoint:

“Once I am sworn in as president, bringing our people home will be one of my top priorities. The experts referred to by President Hudson have reached no such consensus. Instead, their meticulous tests reveal no evidence whatsoever that former abductees have been influenced or physically compromised by the Thargoids.”

“Nevertheless, I am mindful of the public concern. To that end, I will instruct the Department of Health and Wellness to closely monitor all rescued citizens once they have returned home, including mandatory medical checks. This should allay fears and minimise any social ostracism these individuals may face.”

### Thargoid War Update: December 3309

As the year draws to a close, Jade Sanderlyn reflects on humanity’s ongoing conflict against the Thargoids in a summary for Vox Galactica.

“We began 3309 reeling under the colossal impact brought by the Maelstroms, which had arrived on the fringes of the core systems. Unleashed from within these corrosive clouds were Thargoid attacks on a scale never seen before. Hundreds of systems fell rapidly, with the current death toll over a billion. Billions more were forced to flee from their burning homes.”

“It was months before the Thargoid motherships within the Maelstroms were revealed. The Titans remain in place to this day, seemingly indestructible. Their unearthly horror was enhanced when it became clear that they are also prisons for living humans abducted by the aliens.”

“With a reformed Aegis in place, our resistance to these invasions grew stronger over the months. Many fallen systems were recovered, and courageous pilots destroyed countless Thargoid vessels. Their efforts were boosted by technological breakthroughs such as the pulse wave xeno scanner, Thargoid pulse neutraliser and sub-surface extraction missile.”

“More recently, a contaminant developed by Professor Ishmael Palin proved effective against the Thargoid spire sites that emerged on dozens of planets. Another recent success was the clearing of all systems around Taranis. This raises the prospect that other Thargoid fleets could be beaten back to their motherships.”

“Perhaps the most incredible victory is the liberation of hundreds of thousands of abducted people from captivity within the Titans. All were kept in strict quarantine since their return, undergoing tests to ensure that they were not somehow influenced by the Thargoids.”

“Now, however, the Alliance has decided to allow its citizens to return home. Other governments are more cautious, but this has not stopped returnees from receiving gifts, calls and visits from their friends and families. There has been a concerted effort to alleviate their horrific ordeal and reconnect with them as much as possible.”

“And so, as 3310 dawns, there is real hope that this most terrible period of history may have some end in sight. This is Jade Sanderlyn reporting for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there.”
