# Marcan Rayger
Marko Susimets√§ wrote his **Marcan Rayger** stories in 1999 and 2000 and also wrote a short story for the Tales from the Frontier anthology that was released with the release of *Elite: Dangerous*.

**Reception of Marcan Rayger**
Davidtq at Frontier forums commented:

*I really enjoyed the "realism" of the various characters' motivations. Rather than just being an action story there was a good believable character, a person with reasons for what he was doing and not just generic action hero. The motivations and emotions were very thoroughly explored.*

*The fleshing out of the Frontier universe was very nice, putting a face and a style to both the federal military and the empire was great, far more interesting than the simple bbs in the game, giving a feel of real people instead of "standard unit" soldiers.*

*Overall though the story for me was to Frontier what the Dark Wheel was to Elite, but had the advantage of being substantially longer (definitely a good thing).*
