# Hackable Data Transmitter
**Hackable Data Transmitter** is an interaction object which can be found on Installations and on Megaships. Can serve as a mission target. 

## Interaction

You need to scan the ship with data link scanner. Then scan the transmitter (data link scanner for both). After that you need recon limpets to hack the comms array.

As soon as you do the ship will call security and you'll get a bounty. You can avoid the bounty if you stay in silent running the whole time but you can still get noticed.^[1]^
