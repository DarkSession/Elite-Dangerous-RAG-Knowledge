47 (1st century)

**London** is an ancient city on Earth in the Sol system. During World War III in the mid-21st century, London was mostly destroyed. It was subsequently rebuilt, but unlike the city of Cambridge, none of its notable pre-war structures survived.^[1]^

In 3278, as news of the development of the Frame Shift Drive threatened to spur an arms race between the superpowers, representatives of the Federation, Empire, and Alliance met in London to sign the London Treaty, which enforced strict tonnage limits for capital ships.^[2]^

Senator Kahina Tijani Loren of the Empire visited London between March 27 and April 2, 3301 during her diplomatic mission to the Federation. During a concert in the city, she was gifted a bottle of Gerasian Gueuze Beer by local represenatives, which almost sparked a minor diplomatic incident since the liquor had recently been banned within the Empire. Lady Loren took the incident in stride and consumed it before returning to Imperial space.^[3]^

## Timeline

12 AUG 3302

- According to the Galactic Finance Times, analysis of the largest corporations in the Federation and the Empire reveals evidence of a significant economic downturn in the coming years. "We're seeing poor revenue forecasts for a wide range of corporations, including big names like Sirius, Gutamaya and Core Dynamics," said a correspondent for the Galactic Finance Times. "They should be concentrating on marketing to leverage new product ranges, but instead they're diverting resources into intensive research and development. They're ignoring the traditional sales cycle, and we don't know why. It's perplexing." Shareholders have seen poor returns on their investments in recent months, with stock prices dropping across multiple sectors, although this has given others a chance to pick up stock at bargain prices. Several of the pertinent corporations were contacted by the Galactic Finance Times, but none deigned to respond. Despite the GFT's report, some commentators blame the downturn on the London Treaty, which was signed by the galaxy's three major powers in 3278 following the introduction of the frame shift drive. The treaty enforces strict tonnage limitations for capital ships, and was aimed at preventing an arms race, but in recent years it has come to be perceived as a barrier to economic development. One option for investors looking for a risky but possibly lucrative venture is a start-up called MetaDrive Inc., a small company based in the Chi Orionis system specialising in hyperdrive research. The company is reported to be seeking investment.^[2]^

02 APR 3301

- More scandal accompanied Senator Kahina Tijani Loren's continuing visit when she was presented with a large vial of Gerasian Liquor by representatives at a concert in London. The representatives were apparently unaware that the beverage has recently been outlawed in the Empire, and anyone caught carrying it within Imperial territory could be subject to severe sanctions. Federation officials were quick to deny that it was a deliberate ploy to cause further inconvenience to the visiting Senator, whose reception has been dogged with controversy in equal measure to the unexpected popularity she has received from the general populace. Lady Kahina received the gift in good grace. When questioned about the illegality of the beverage in her home jurisdiction she replied with "They really needn't worry, I'll drink it all before I get home."^[3]^

27 MAR 3301

- In an open letter addressed for the attention of Senator Kahina Tijani Loren, Alliance representatives from Alioth have extended an invitation for her to visit their star-systems with the assurance the her trip will be free from "bungling bureaucracy, petty-minded procrastinators and deranged docking debacles." Apparently Lady Kahina's visit was placed on the agenda at a recent diplomatic exchange between the Alliance and the Federation with assurances sought by Alliance representatives that "somebody competent would be checking the paperwork in detail, and if at all possible, that landing pads could be reserved in advance." Lady Kahina is currently being entertained on Earth, where she was greeted by enthusiastically cheering crowds on arrival at the historic Cambridge spaceport before being taken to London to be met by Ambassador Waite. The Mail on Mars even commented that "We should have more Senators drop in for visit, she's done more for Imperial Federation relations in a month than all those ambassadors have done in decades."^[4]^
