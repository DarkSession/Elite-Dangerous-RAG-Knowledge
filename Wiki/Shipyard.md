Shipyard
 		 	 

The **Shipyard** is the option in the menu of a station that lets you buy and sell ships, store ships if you have more than one, and transfer ships from other stations in the Galaxy.

In the pre-seeded Galaxy, a wealthy system with a High-Tech Economy is more likely than others to have many different ships to purchase but this is not always the case. In some systems with conflict zones, stations nearby will often have as many ships listed as a High-Tech one.

In Trailblazers, a system must have a Tech Level of 35 and the station must have Large landing pads.^[1]^ When these conditions are met the station will offer a Shipyard.

## Storage limit

The shipyard has a storage limit of 40 ships. However, this is only a maximum per location.  So you can store more ships at another station.

You can keep your regular or favorite ships at your home station or carrier and keep the less commonly used ships elsewhere.

The ship limit was 250 per commander in September 2015.^[2]^ If you exceed this soft cap, you may encounter problems when switching ships such as the game crashing or sending you back to the main login. When you log back in you're in a sidewinder, regardless of the ship you tried to buy. That ship will be in your shipyard but when you try to switch to it, or your previous ship, or any other ships in the yard you will encounter problems.^[2]^

## Sell Ship

When a player sells a ship, they get only 90% of the total value of the ship back. In order to retain as much money as possible, players should sell modules and parts of the ship and replace them with the cheapest modules available.

This feature also makes it worthless to sell and rebuy ships for different purposes. It is recommended to buy a ship and keep it permanently and then buy additional ships while keeping primary ships.

## Ship Transfer

You can have a ship transferred to other stations in the galaxy. This costs a significant fee and depends on the distance. The transit time increases with longer distances.

## Upgrade Ship

There are many things a player needs to take into consideration when upgrading to a bigger ship. As a ship owner it is crucial that you calculate the prices of all the upgrades you wish to make on your new ship and save this money in advance prior to buying the ship. Even though it might be easy to upgrade from a Cobra to a Type-6 and all its modules, when you reach the bigger ships on the list, an upgrade can be an economical bankruptcy. Going from a Type-7 to a Python not only require the roughly 50 million credits for the initial ship purchase, but also an additional 40 million credits for class A modules for the Python. This is something a lot of players are experiencing when going from the somewhat expensive ships to the bigger ships and is not written anywhere as information.
