# Orbital Junction
Orbital Junction overview
 		 	 

**Orbital Junction** was a planned CQC Championship arena. It was the first CQC arena previewed to players, but was never added to *Elite Dangerous*. It features a space elevator, some asteroids, and predominately red skybox lighting. It has been speculated that Orbital Junction was reworked into Elevate.^[1]^
