## Notes

- Ultra-Compact Processor Prototypes were originally named "Nvidia Geforce GTX Titan Black", and were introduced to *Elite Dangerous* on March 27, 2015 for a scavenger hunt contest. The first five players to find the starport stocking the commodity and then sell 1 unit to Godel Ring in Ededleen won a real Nvidia GTX Titan Black.^[1]^ After the contest ended, the commodity was renamed and given a new description.
