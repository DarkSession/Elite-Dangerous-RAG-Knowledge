Genetic Sampler
 		 	 

The **Genetic Sampler** is an On Foot tool to collect and index samples from living organisms.^[1]^ It is equipped with the Artemis Suit. Data collected with the Genetic Sampler unlocks Codex entries for the related species, and can be sold at Vista Genomics for Credits.^[2]^ It was introduced in *ED: Odyssey*.

## Usage

Using the Genetic Sampler first requires equipping a Loadout with the Artemis Suit. While On Foot, the Genetic Sampler's "Sample Mode" can be used to extract a partial sample from a single specimen of alien flora. To locate valid specimens, the Genetic Sampler has a scan pulse function with a range of 70 meters that can be activated by aiming it. The area immediately surrounding the user will be temporarily highlighted in different colors:

- **Purple** for specimens of a different species than the sample that is currently stored within the Genetic Sampler
- **Blue** for specimens that have already been sampled
- **Green** for specimens not yet sampled or have samples in the Genetic Sampler

Upon activating Sample Mode within range of the specimen, the Genetic Sampler will automatically scan and collect a partial sample of genetic material from the specimen.^[3]^ In order to acquire a complete specimen, the user must extract a total of three partial samples from different specimens within the same species that are outside of that genus' clonal colony range. For example, if a sample is taken from a specimen of a organism with a clonal colony range of 100 meters, then the next two samples need to be taken from specimens at least 100 meters away from the first in order to provide the necessary genetic diversity. Once three samples are collected, they will combine and create a single complete specimen that can then be redeemed at any Vista Genomics location for profit, which also counts towards Exobiologist rank.

### Nomenclature

The flora nomenclature in *ED: Odyssey* roughly has three levels: genus (displayed by the DSS and determines clonal range), (morpho-)species (determines the shape), (chromo-)variant (determines the color). Not every organism has all three levels. A breakdown of some names follows.

| Name | Genus | Species | Variant |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stratum Paleas - Lime | Stratum | Paleas (meaning "husk") | Lime |
| Bacterium Informem - Red | Bacterium | Informem (meaning "formless") | Red |
| Albidum Sinuous Tuber | Sinuous Tuber | (none) | Albidum (meaning "white") |
| Roseum Bioluminescent Anemone | Anemone | (none) | Roseum (meaning "red") Bioluminescent |
| Crystalline Shard | Crystalline Shard | (none) | (none) |
