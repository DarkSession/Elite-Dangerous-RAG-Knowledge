The **Manifest Scanner**, formerly known as the **Cargo Scanner**, is a utility module that can scan other ships and identify any and all Commodities they are carrying. If any cargo in the scanned ship is stolen, the ship's owner will incur a bounty. The Scanner also analyses the contents of any Passenger Cabins on a targeted ship. Using the scanner is an intrusive act, and the target is immediately alerted when the scan is initiated.

## Usage

The Manifest Scanner must be assigned to a fire group and activated manually. It only works on targeted ships within its range, in an angle in front of the ship. Holding down the fire button will initiate a scan, and the button must remain depressed until the scan completes, a process that takes approximately 10 seconds. The target must be kept within the Manifest Scanner's range for the entire scan, otherwise the process will be interrupted and must be restarted.

Station security forces frequently initiate random scans of ships within the station's no fire zone to search for stolen and illegal commodities, as well as any illegal passengers. Security forces patrolling shipping lanes will also interdict ships from supercruise for the same reason. Pirates often use Manifest Scanners to search for valuable commodities. Additionally, assassins or bounty hunters who interdict Passenger Carriers may attempt a scan to confirm their target is aboard. 

Smugglers can evade security scans by quickly docking or jumping back to supercruise with the aid of Silent Running. Another option is to deploy ship hardpoints and refrain from firing any weapons, which will cause security forces to briefly break off their scan to deploy their own hardpoints as a precaution. Evasive maneuvers may also work - a fast target can boost past the scanning ship and get out of scanning range. 

If an NPC ship is turned hostile, it will no longer attempt to use its manifest scanner until its target leaves or is destroyed.
