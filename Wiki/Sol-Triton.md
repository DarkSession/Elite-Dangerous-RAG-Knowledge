# Sol/Triton
Triton
 		 	 

**Triton** is the largest moon of Neptune and the seventh largest in Sol. It is the coldest known body in Sol; Voyager 2 recorded a surface temperature of -235 °C (-391 °F). Its surface has few impact craters, indicating it is a relatively young moon (6 to 50 million years old). It is geologically active with geysers, volcanoes and earthquakes.

Triton was first discovered by the British astronomer William Lassell on 10 October 1846, just 17 days after Neptune was discovered by the German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle and Heinrich Louis d'Arrest.^[1]^

Triton is permit-locked by the minor faction Mother Gaia.
