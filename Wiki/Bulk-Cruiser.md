# Bulk Cruiser
Dionysus Class Agricultural Vessel
 		 	 

AÂ **Bulk Cruiser** is a type of Megaship that fills a wide variety of civilian and military roles. They most often are used to transport large quantities of containers, materials, fuel, liquids, agricultural products, passengers, and prisoners across the galaxy. Some are also deployed to conduct scientific research and surveys to gather system and planetary data. Bulk Cruisers have no Landing Pads of any kind, and therefore cannot accommodate any smaller ships.
