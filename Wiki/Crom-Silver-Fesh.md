> A variant of the synthetic psychoactive drug based on a closely guarded secret recipe. While active, it causes the user to lock their teeth together and rapidly exhale, a reaction that led to its street name, Fesh. This variant was created from a stolen recipe for Wolf 1301 Fesh and is the closest Fesh variant in terms of quality to the original. Banned in most jurisdictions.
