**Facece** is an Imperial system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It is the Empire's most important military bastion, with various Imperial Navy bases located on worlds throughout the system, including Topaz and Peters's Wreck.^[1]^ Chancellor Anders Blaine is the system's administrator and represents its people in the Imperial Senate; prior to her ascension to the Imperial throne in late 3301, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval served alongside Blaine as a second senator of Facece. The famed Jaques Station also originated in this system, having been built and launched from the orbit of Topaz.^[2]^ Access to Facece is restricted, and requires a permit that can only be obtained by achieving the Imperial Navy rank of Earl.

Regarded as the second most important system in all of the Empire, Facece has remained a loyal Imperial member since its colonisation. However, this long record was briefly interrupted in 3302 when the Allied Facece Order, an independent faction, led an insurrection in January of that year that overthrew the Facece Empire Party. Two weeks later, on February 4, Chancellor Blaine announced plans to retake the system, claiming his delayed response was due to focusing on military preparations.^[3]^ Facece's liberation was a slow and bloody struggle. It was not until July 2, 3302 that Imperial Naval Auxiliary forces under Marquis Endincite turned the tide against the insurrection and restored the Facece Empire Party to power, and the piecemeal process of reclaiming various orbital and planetary ports continued for weeks afterwards.^[4]^
