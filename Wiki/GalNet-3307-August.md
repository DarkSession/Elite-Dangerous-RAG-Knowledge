### Marlinists in Crisis After Starport Bombings

The NMLA’s attacks against the Marlinist Colonies have caused mass casualties, disruption and political chaos.

More than 35,000 civilians were killed in the attacks, with twice as many suffering injuries and caustic burns. Safeguard Interstellar is providing vital supplies to survivors, and evacuations of Stillman Hub and Tilman Point stations are ongoing.

First Minister Jenna Fairfax has been confirmed dead. Minister Amrita Ross has temporarily assumed leadership, but the Marlinist Parliament has been destabilised by heated accusations between its members.

The Marlinist Constabulary has tightened security, and ACT is running urgent investigations. Captain Milo Castile told the media:

“This was undoubtedly the work of Theta Group, the NMLA’s weapons specialists. We have found evidence that local Neo-Marlinist supporters provided logistical support, and arrests are forthcoming. However, as always the terrorists covered their tracks remarkably well.”

Alliance and Federation leaders have sent messages of condolence and offers of medical aid. Prime Consul Kayode Tau is liaising with both superpowers to coordinate relief efforts.

In the Empire, from which the Marlinists fled as refugees in 3306, there are mixed reactions. Some wish to extend protection to former Imperial citizens, while others see it as poetic justice for their republican beliefs ‘creating’ the NMLA.

## 03 AUG

### Superpowers Respond to New Onionhead

The Alliance, Empire and Federation have clarified their official positions regarding the emergence of onionhead gamma strain.

All variants of the popular psychedelic drug remain illegal within Federal space. Ambassador Jasmina Halsey, who was president in 3300 when the ruling was made, announced:

“I am pleased that my decision to outlaw onionhead stands. I still maintain that it leads to experimentation with more dangerous narcotics, and we must steer our youth away from that path.”

The Empire has also declared onionhead illegal, despite rumours that it is imported by the wealthiest citizens for private use. Princess Aisling Duval told the media:

“It was insulting enough that Delaine was allowed into the Galactic Summit, but now he’s peddling filthy drugs and pretending it’s medicine! I only pray that nobody loses a loved one to such poison, as I have.”

The Alliance has not made a broad ruling regarding onionhead, which is illegal in the majority of member systems but available in those classified as having anarchy governments. However, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran addressed the issue:

“As with most trade, we defer to the legislation of local authorities. But we are in contact with the IHO and are keeping a close eye on the situation.”

Onionhead gamma strain remains on sale in selected systems governed by industrial anarchy factions.

### Federal Forces Combat New Rebellion

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

In the Kuwembaa system, the Federation is fighting to prevent further factions from declaring independence.

New Kuwembaa Labour has broken ties with the Federation in protest against the government’s civil surveillance programme.

Li Chotep for Equality, a local Federal faction, has been tasked to degrade the rebelling faction’s military strength. President Zachary Hudson made a brief public announcement:

“I call upon all Federal auxiliaries to aid in this conflict. The reputation of the Federation cannot be so easily tarnished by such criminal action.”

Governor Sonal Mishra, the leader of New Kuwembaa Labour, also requested assistance:

“The Federal Accord is no longer fit for purpose. We require support to make a stand against this violation of our constitutional rights.”

Three other Federal factions are about to declare themselves as independent sovereign states: Selkana Labour, United HIP 108095 Values Party and Mutumu Future. These control a combined total of 28 systems.

However, two recently seceded factions – the Coalition of Uteran and Gluscap Labour – are considering rejoining the Federation, depending on the result of the Kuwembaa conflict.

Pro-independence pilots can support New Kuwembaa Labour by delivering combat bonds to Gagnan Port station. Federal auxiliaries can fight on behalf of Li Chotep for Equality by handing in combat bonds at the Fortress Liberty megaship.

### Thargoid Cultists Prepare for Religious Voyages

Three megaships are being populated by the Far God cult, part of their latest effort to recruit members and find their alien deity.

The first vessel, the Testament, will serve as a missionary ship and journey throughout the core systems, attempting to convert new followers to the Thargoid-worshipping sect.

While the mystical cult is typically secretive in nature, Vox Galactica obtained a quote from a member named the Second Witness of the Seventieth Chapter:

“The masses are deaf to the voice of the Far God. What you see as alien monsters, we view as messengers from a very real multi-dimensional being. The Testament will help us carry the word of Its imminent arrival.”

Two other megaships have been outfitted for long-range journeys. The Perdition and the Sacrosanct will carry many thousands of cultists on what they view as a pilgrimage to the Far God.

Dr Alfred Ulyanov, a leading exotheologian and expert on the religion, commented:

“This fringe creed, which has survived endless abuse and attacks, has now reached a surprising level of organisation. Most of us associate the Thargoids with death and destruction, making it all the more remarkable that these people see only divinity.”

## 09 AUG

### Tensions Inflamed in Marlinist Colonies

The bombing of two Marlinist starports by the NMLA has caused political rifts and public protests across the colony systems.

Local newsfeed The Marlin Standard reported on current events:

“Our entire society is still reeling in shock after last week’s attacks against Stillman Hub and Tilman Point stations. There has been mass panic in fear of further terrorist strikes, with unprecedented scenes of violence against known Neo-Marlinist supporters.”

“Without the respected leadership of First Minister Jenna Fairfax, angry exchanges and recriminations have divided the Marlinist Parliament. Minister Aaron Whyte claimed that ‘we invited this tragedy upon ourselves’ by not voting for a Neo-Marlinist prime consul. In response, Minister Octavia Volkov called for Whyte’s arrest as ‘an accessory to mass murder’.”

“Some community leaders expressed sorrow at a lost opportunity to establish a Marlinist presence in the Imperial Senate. This is certainly the view of Acting First Minister Amrita Ross, who believes in rejoining the Empire.”

“All of which has led to a baptism of fire for Prime Consul Kayode Tau, whose focus has been on arranging medical aid from the Alliance and Federation. It may be that the Marlinist Consulate will soon be called upon to mediate between its own people.”

### Zemina Torval Creates New Corporation

A new independent branch of Mastopolos Mining has been established by its controlling shareholder, Senator Zemina Torval.

The megacorp is owned by the powerful Mastopolos family, and operates throughout the Empire and beyond. However, Torval’s position as a majority shareholder has allowed her to exert a strong influence on its activities.

Senator Torval confirmed her plans in a statement to The Imperial Herald:

“Diversification is an effective strategy in the current business climate. Torval-Mastopolos Mining will have corporate autonomy, while offering the same mining and transportation services to an emergent client base.”

Marlon Royce, business analyst for Vox Galactica, reported:

“The persistent rumours of a rift between Zemina Torval and her cousin, CEO Gabriella Mastopolos, may now be validated. Insiders report that after decades of working behind the scenes, Torval wishes to provide a more tangible legacy for her own children. Already she has set her sights on a permit-controlled system as the headquarters for this new company.”

As well as being renowned for her private wealth and corporate enterprises, Zemina Torval has been a prominent member of the Imperial Senate for decades. She has occasionally deputised as chancellor, and is known to be an outspoken champion of the Empire’s traditions.

## 11 AUG

### Aegis Probed by Board of Inquiry

An investigation into the tri-superpower organisation Aegis is seeking to establish the reasons for its failures.

Dr Paul Baumann, chair of the independent board of inquiry, outlined its scope:

“The initial phase is to fully understand the work of Aegis, before examining strategic and operational decisions. Interviews with senior staff have been scheduled, with Admiral Aden Tanner providing details on military activity.”

“One specific area of attention is the lost megaship Alexandria. We are performing a thorough analysis, including background checks on its crew. Hyperspace physicists are theorising probable causes for its failure to arrive at HIP 30944.”

“We will be raising issues of culpability, specifically whether the concentration of Guardian artefacts aboard the Alexandria directly led to systems coming under Thargoid attack. Other incidents will be reviewed to identify possible grounds for negligence.”

Many prominent figures within Aegis have resigned including Professor Alba Tesreau, Director Yazhu Xing and Dr Mia Valencourt. All active projects have been suspended, with routine activities continuing under independent observation.

Some politicians in all three superpowers have protested against the inquiry, concerned about weakening defences against the Thargoids. Others believe Aegis is not fit for purpose, calling for a more localised approach to anti-xeno operations.

## 12 AUG

### Victory Against Federation for Independent Factions

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

New Kuwembaa Labour has successfully seceded from the Federation and inspired other systems to declare independence.

The conflict in the Kuwembaa system ended with Federal loyalists Li Chotep for Equality being defeated. As a result, all systems controlled by New Kuwembaa Labour will remain independent.

This has inspired Selkana Labour, United HIP 108095 Values Party and Mutumu Future to also sever ties with the Federation, spreading the rebellion across a further 28 systems.

The victory was announced by Governor Sonal Mishra, the leader of New Kuwembaa Labour:

“We owe a huge debt to all pilots who helped us secure our freedom. It is regrettable that we were forced to secede, but this should be a warning to President Hudson that he is taking the Federation down a dangerous path.”

The rebelling systems have now shut down links with the Proactive Detection Bureau, which monitors all private and public communications. More Federal factions are now debating secession as the only way to guarantee their citizens’ privacy rights.

Pilots who fought for New Kuwembaa Labour can now claim their rewards from Gagnan Port station. Li Chotep for Equality will reimburse Federal auxiliaries at the Fortress Liberty megaship.

### Marlinist Civil War Declared

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Conflict has erupted in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system between two factions of the Marlinist Colonies.

The Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah'Sine has declared war against the Marlinism Reformation Party, which acts as the political wing of the NMLA.

Political relations degenerated into open combat following the NMLA’s recent attacks, with Acting First Minister Amrita Ross’s efforts to negotiate a peaceful resolution proving unsuccessful.

A new megaship, Freedom’s Voice, has entered service. It is acting as the operational base for the forces of the Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah'Sine.

Supporters of the Marlinism Reformation Party are gathering at the Steel Majesty megaship. This was formerly used by the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid to flee from their home system.

Minister Octavia Volkov announced in parliament:

“Aaron Whyte and his collaborators are directly responsible for tens of thousands of deaths. I will not rest until they are defeated and brought to justice.”

Minister Aaron Whyte sent this response from his private vessel:

“Volkov’s unlawful strike is a violation of our colonies’ charter. We call upon all true Marlinists to defend us from this illegal act of aggression.”

The Alliance, Empire and Federation have informed the Marlinist Consulate that they consider this conflict to be a strictly internal matter.

## 13 AUG

### Onionhead Legality Sparks Debate

The introduction of onionhead gamma strain by the Kumo Crew has reignited long-running arguments around the popular psychedelic drug.

An interview with Zander Lachance, spokesperson for the Coalition for Legalisation, was published by Vox Galactica:

“I have yet to see evidence that onionhead is more harmful than common recreational substances. Open-minded people in independent systems are now discovering this for themselves.”

In response, other newsfeeds featured a range of opinions.

Eye on Achenar: “Foppish rogues of the Federation such as Zachary Rackham and Sir Randolph Plaskett may feel comfortable wooing trade tycoons with the outlawed weed, but legalising low-cost onionhead would risk the whole Empire collapsing into a stupor!”

The Pegasi Sentinel: “The popularity of ‘helix’ is steadily growing, and the revenue it generates will undoubtedly benefit those fortunate to live within Archon Delaine’s dominion.”

Sol Today: “Imperial hedonists such as Senator Leatrix and Duchess Rouncival may offer such illicit treats at their decadent parties, but bombarding the masses with this cheap narcotic will have the entire Federation chasing unicorns!”

The Sovereign: “Tourists from many independent worlds are booking holidays to the Alici, Baraswar, Kishpakho, Nastrond and Nocori systems, where the gamma strain of onionhead is legal. There is no shortage of Alliance citizens following suit, which may pressure the Assembly to formally legislate one way or the other.”

## 16 AUG

### Rival Corporations Compete in LTT 198

Torval-Mastopolos Mining and Wreaken Construction have both established a presence in the LTT 198 system.

Marlon Royce, business analyst for Vox Galactica, reviewed the situation:

“It is highly unusual for two megacorps to set up new headquarters in the same place. But Mastopolos Mining and Wreaken Construction have always competed aggressively for mining and transportation contracts, so it seems a new chapter in their rivalry has begun.”

“This permit-locked system is controlled by the independent faction LTT 198 State Ltd. Insiders claim that it demanded a fortune from both corporations in return for granting passage to its ships and allowing construction of industrial complexes on the planet Dini.”

“This is the first significant move from Senator Zemina Torval’s new company, an autonomous offshoot of Mastopolos Mining. It may be that Wreaken Construction’s presence is an effort to crush their old enemy before she can acquire further corporate strength.”

The Imperial Herald reported that Constantia Torval, one of Zemina Torval’s daughters, has travelled from the Synteini system to LTT 198. It is believed Constantia has taken command of Torval-Mastopolos Mining’s operations.

## 17 AUG

### Leaked Report Exposes Aegis Failures

The Aegis board of inquiry’s initial findings have been leaked to journalists, with several problems within the anti-xeno organisation detailed in the files.

Vox Galactica journalist Alexei Keel reported on its contents:

“The independent inquiry into Aegis is in its early stages, making this disclosure of delicate information all the more embarrassing. Although only a summary, it highlights shortcomings that were immediately apparent to the investigators.”

“The leaked files outline a pattern of poor internal organisation and negligence. One claim is that Aegis accepted its heavy reliance on independent pilots entering combat situations against the Thargoids.”

“A lack of technological breakthroughs since the first generation of AX weaponry is also criticised. Professor Tesreau, who has since resigned, is singled out for prioritising communication with the Thargoids rather than developing quickly deployed defences.”

“Interview transcripts show that some Aegis personnel consider the inquiry itself to be part of a larger agenda. A recurring claim is that the superpowers directly contributed to Aegis’s inefficiency by reducing funding, and are now scapegoating Aegis management for a lack of progress.”

“Dr Paul Baumann, chair of the board of inquiry, said that only the final report should be considered official. It is unclear when the ‘Baumann Report’, as some newsfeeds refer to it, might be ready for publication.”

## 19 AUG

### Anti-NMLA Forces Win Marlinist Civil War

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The conflict in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system has been won by the Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah'Sine.

Support from independent pilots played a key role in defeating the Marlinism Reformation Party. The faction’s entire leadership has been arrested, with their replacements vowing to reshape it along politically moderate lines.

Minister Octavia Volkov made a declaration of victory to the Marlinist Parliament:

“The Neo-Marlinists have been crushed and Aaron Whyte is dead – a casualty of the war his terrorist paymasters began. I deeply regret that our society has suffered this, but have no regrets at destroying the NMLA’s political wing once and for all.”

Prime Consul Kayode Tau sent assurances to the Alliance, Empire and Federation that they should view this as “confirmation that the Marlinist Colonies are your steadfast allies in the fight against the NMLA”.

ACT has drafted in extra resources to investigate the Marlinism Reformation Party’s ties to Theta Group, the terrorist bomb-makers responsible for last month’s devastating starport attacks.

With First Minister Jenna Fairfax confirmed as among the fatalities, Acting First Minister Amrita Ross has organised a snap election to democratically appoint a new leader for the Marlinist Colonies.

### LTT 198 Hosts Competing Mining Campaigns

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Torval-Mastopolos Mining and Wreaken Construction have requested deliveries of mined resources to the LTT 198 system.

LTT 198 State Ltd, its controlling faction, will only allow one of the rival corporations to remain permanently. The company with the most successful campaign will establish a new starport in the permit-controlled system.

Senator Zemina Torval, who has sole control of the Mastopolos Mining subsidiary, announced:

“My company is working on an experimental mining laser with increased range. To achieve this, shipments of mined resources must be delivered in sufficient numbers to the Pride of Bitterwood megaship in LTT 198.”

Emmerich Koenig, CEO of Wreaken Construction, outlined a counter-initiative:

“We will pay handsomely for deliveries of mined resources to the megaship Tobias’s Gift in the LTT 198 system.”

Both factions have requested units of coltan, gallite, praseodymium and silver.

LTT 198 State Ltd will provide all contributors to these initiatives with temporary system permits lasting one week.

## 20 AUG

### Conspiracy Theorist Finds Network Home

Independent journalist Flint ‘Firemaker’ Lafosse has announced that the Rewired network will broadcast Kit Fowler’s conspiracy-laden show End Times.

Lafosse, notorious for his own sensationalist claims, announced:

“Finally, someone else who sees things as they really are! Kit Fowler’s perceptive views match his technical genius. By retransmitting his End Times broadcasts, I’ll be helping people resist the narrative conditioning being pumped into our minds by the faceless elite.”

Kit Fowler provides specialised engineering services from his workshop in the Capoya system. He has used his show to make many outlandish claims over the years. These include labelling the shadowy figure ‘Salvation’ an AI construct, accusing Utopia of secretly creating a new species of human, and arguing that the universe’s true shape is being concealed by superpower-sponsored holograms.

Lafosse advertised Fowler’s content with an excerpt from the most recent End Times episode:

“Years ago, a sinister group called Black Flight committed multiple crimes, including murder, to suppress evidence of Thargoid activity after the First War. The mainstream newsfeeds buried the story, of course. But the fearless truth-seekers among us have repeatedly named the Colonia, Neche and Wasat systems as locations where the Black Flight operated.”

“There’s a real buzz in that region right now… something’s going on that they don’t want you to know about. Never give up our search for the right facts, people!”

## 23 AUG

### A Fractured Federation

Shadow President Felicia Winters has claimed that further systems declaring independence could severely damage the Federation.

Her statement was in response to the conflict in the Kuwembaa system, which resulted in more Federal factions seceding from the superpower. Dozens of others are now openly considering breaking away and becoming independent.

Addressing Congress, Shadow President Winters said:

“We now face the possibility of large-scale rebellion, as more citizens reject intrusion into their private lives. Unless these authoritarian surveillance laws are repealed, we risk many more factions and allies losing their trust in any Federal government.”

Vice President Jerome Archer responded:

“The Proactive Detection Bureau provides increased security and decreased crime levels for all Federal systems. I deeply regret that a few have rejected its benefits, but we must concentrate on the bigger picture.”

The Sovereign newsfeed described how the newly seceded systems are celebrating freedom from government scrutiny. It claims that up to fifty other factions have expressed interest in becoming independent.

However, The Federal Times reported that more pragmatic leaders have voiced concerns that they are now more vulnerable. There are particular fears of retaliation by pro-Federation groups or attacks from opportunistic hostile forces.

## 24 AUG

### Onionhead's Medical Benefits Verified

The Interstellar Health Organisation has validated the Kumo Crew’s claim that onionhead gamma strain, also known as ‘helix’, has medicinal properties.

Dr Nisha Devi, one of the IHO’s senior researchers, told the media:

“We have analysed user data in the independent systems where onionhead gamma strain is on sale. Unexpectedly, the initial marketing claims that ‘helix’ can be used for medicinal purposes have been authenticated.”

“A significant percentage of customers are believed to be using the drug for healthcare reasons rather than recreational use. Reports show that it is a successful treatment for many psychological disorders, bringing faster results than conventional neuroleptics. It may also provide effective symptomatic relief for patients with musculoskeletal conditions.”

“Several research facilities are now running clinical trials on the viability of using onionhead gamma strain in medical practice. The IHO is monitoring these studies and will publish the results.”

Vandermeer Corporation, the largest pharmaceutical company in the Federation, published a statement from its head of marketing Ronan Roscoe:

“These conclusions are biased and informed by inaccurate data. We maintain that all forms of onionhead are dangerous narcotics with long-term detriments to health. Vandermeer’s antipsychotic treatments are effective without the side effects of mild psychedelic experiences.”

## 26 AUG

### Mining Campaign Success for Zemina Torval

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The Torval-Mastopolos Mining initiative in the LTT 198 system has outperformed Wreaken Construction’s rival campaign.

Pilots delivered mined resources to the megaships Pride of Bitterwood and Tobias’s Gift to support the competing corporations. Ultimately, it was the new subsidiary of Mastopolos Mining that received the greatest quantities.

Senator Zemina Torval provided a statement to Imperial media:

“This is an auspicious beginning for my new enterprise. I am pleased to offer rewards to my supporters at the Pride of Bitterwood in the EGM 559 system.”

In addition to credits, the top 75% of Torval’s supporters will be provided with an experimental mining laser and permanent permit access to LTT 198.

Constantia Torval, one of the senator’s daughters, has assumed the role of director of operations with Torval-Mastopolos Mining. There has been no comment from the Mastopolos family regarding the subsidiary, which is being run autonomously by Zemina Torval.

CEO Emmerich Koenig confirmed that Wreaken Construction will soon withdraw from LTT 198. Pilots who supported its efforts can now claim reimbursement from Tobias’s Gift in the EGM 559 system. The top 10% of Koenig’s supporters will receive an experimental abrasion blaster as well.

LTT 198 State Ltd has reinstated permit control for entry to the LTT 198 system. A new starport will shortly be constructed and administered by Torval-Mastopolos Mining.

## 27 AUG

### Marlinists Regroup in Civil War Aftermath

The Marlinist Colonies are recovering from a period of political infighting and inter-faction conflict.

Octavia Volkov has been voted in as the new first minister following a snap election. Her decisive action against Aaron Whyte’s Neo-Marlinist movement, which led to the elimination of the NMLA’s political wing, drew huge support from voters.

In a parliamentary address, First Minister Volkov said:

“We must focus on building an independent society rather than changing the Empire. In time we will evolve into the fully-fledged Marlinist Republic we have fought so hard for, and perhaps inspire our Imperial cousins to walk the path to democracy.”

Marlinist factions now control all eight of their original colony systems, some of which had temporarily fallen under external governance. They have also expanded into a handful of new systems.

Prime Consul Kayode Tau, the chief ambassador of the Marlinists, has established formal channels with the Alliance Office of Diplomatic Relations and the Federal Diplomatic Corps. The Empire recognises the Marlinist Consulate, but maintains a distant relationship with what many consider to be subversive ex-Imperials.

The ceremonial funeral of First Minister Jenna Fairfax has taken place. Speakers drew attention to her achievements and leadership qualities. In a gesture that many viewed as an olive branch from the Empire, Princess Aisling Duval attended virtually and spoke of her meeting with Fairfax during the Galactic Summit.

## 30 AUG

### Corporation Plans Onionhead Medical Product

The pharmaceutical giant Neomedical Industries aims to mass-produce onionhead gamma strain as a medicine.

The announcement follows a report from the Interstellar Health Organisation, which details how the new onionhead variant is an effective treatment for many psychological and musculoskeletal conditions.

Olwyn Kendrick, CEO of Neomedical Industries, told the media:

“The IHO has confirmed the findings of our research of onionhead gamma strain’s use for specific medical purposes. Clinical trials prove that its psychedelic qualities are no more intense than the side effects of conventional neuroleptics.”

“It is inappropriate that a crime syndicate should provide a product that can relieve the suffering of millions. Therefore, we aim to build our own stockpile to expedite its distribution to common markets.”

This statement was viewed as controversial in some quarters, particularly within the Federation. However, there have been expressions of interest from many independent factions. The Kumo Crew syndicate, which manufactures and distributes onionhead gamma strain, has offered no response as yet.

Neomedical Industries is one of the two largest pharmaceutical companies in the galaxy, alongside Vandermeer Corporation. It provides healthcare services and equipment exclusively to Alliance and independent systems.

## 31 AUG

### Hyford's Cache Reveals Mysterious Project

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

A data bank left by a crashed vessel on the moon Colonia 5 e a has reactivated, revealing clues as to its origin.

The crash site was first discovered over four years ago via listening posts in the Colonia, Neche and Wasat systems. These posts held transmissions from the ship’s owner, Commander Hyford, discussing his attempts to avoid members of a private military outfit he had previously worked for.

This latest development was discussed by Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency:

“Commander Hyford spoke of making deliveries to a nameless organisation in the Pleiades, and left a data cache in the Colonia system that provided further details. Hyford’s Cache, as some investigators referred to it, had remained locked until a manually-set timer system finally expired last week. The information within has apparently directed pilots to investigate the HIP 26176 system.”

“It’s possible that Kit Fowler’s recent theories regarding Black Flight – another old mystery – might prove relevant after all. But there are bigger questions that need answering. Who was Hyford working for? Were they responsible for causing his ship to crash? And if so, what secrets were they trying to keep?”
