# Communications
Chat is the primary form of text-based **communication** in *Elite Dangerous*. To view or send ship-to-ship text messages, the player must select the Comms panel (use focus mode or press the Comms hotkey, which is "C" by default). The player can use standard interface controls to navigate the Comms Panel and cycle through tabs.

## Chat Channels

There are various chat channels. The incoming text channels can be customized in the options tab of the Commans Panel.

- Main = is used for Wings and such.
- Direct Messages From Players = for sending and receiving direct messages from other players.
- System = message people in the same star system. System chat crosses all game modes within the same star system. So e.g. a person flying in Solo mode in supercruise can talk to another person docked in a station in Open mode in the same star system.
- Wing = message Wing members.
- Squad = the main chat channel for Squadron members.
- Squad Leaders = high level discussion among leaders of a Squadron based on ranks.

## Squadron Feed

The Comms Panel has a Squadron Feed tab where activity from the squadron gets posted. Certain ranks are permitted to post public and internal statements in the feed. Public statements can be viewed by non-members while browsing Squadrons. Internal statements are only view able by squadron members. There can be one sticky per category. The most recent one is listed on top. Squadrons can also share bookmarks.

## Chat log

This tab is marked with a speech bubble icon. Here you can view incoming text comms and send text comms.

- Untargeted (local) comms will be broadcast to \*all\* nearby ships.
- Use [TAB] to cycle through valid message recipients.

### Commands

To submit a command, type it and submit it (press [Enter]).

### Channels
