The **Enhanced AX Missile Rack** is a variant of the AX Missile Rack created by Liz Ryder for Aegis. Turreted and Fixed variants of this weapon were introduced in various Community Goals during the Second Thargoid war, respectively on 11 Dec. 3308 and 26 Dec. 3308. They offer slightly increased damage and significantly improved projectile speed in exchange of virtually no drawback compared to their respective regular variant. All Enhanced AX Missile Racks are available in both Class 2 and Class 3 versions, and can be purchased for credits at the outfitting of Rescue Megaships.

Similarly to the regular variant, the Enhanced AX Missile Rack is designed primarily for combat against Thargoid ships, and consequently deals less damage against conventional human ships than a standard Missile Rack. Unlike the latter, Enhanced AX Missile Racks cannot be engineered.
