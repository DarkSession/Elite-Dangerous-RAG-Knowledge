The **Fragment Cannon** is a weapon module that fires bursts containing 12 projectiles, similar to a shotgun. While each individual projectile has low damage, it can fire three bursts of 12 quickly in a row. Fragment Cannons are capable of devastating close range targets, but very quickly drop in effectiveness with range as many of these projectiles will simply miss.

## Usage

Fragment Cannons have very high theoretical damage per second (DPS), which in practice will rarely be reached. The speed of the weapon's projectiles is 667 m/s, jitter is 5°, and maximum range is 2000m (Damage Falloff 1800m), regardless of class or mounting. The unpredictable jitter and wide spread of the weapon make it inconsistent, and this together with the relatively slow projectile speed mean that outside of 200 meters the majority of this damage will not hit an intended target. The closer the target, the greater chance of more projectiles landing. It is therefore recommended to use Fragment Cannons on a fast and maneuverable ship that can maintain close combat range.

Like other kinetic weapons, Fragment Cannons have a damage penalty against shields and a bonus against hull. Unlike other kinetic weapons they have poor armour piercing ratings, meaning that larger vessels with higher Armour Hardness will resist much of their damage. Still, given their raw damage output, concentrated fire from multiple fragment cannons at extreme close range may still prove overwhelming against shields and armour hardness all the same. 

A variant of the Fragment Cannon, the Pacifier Frag-Cannon, is available as a Powerplay loyalty reward.
