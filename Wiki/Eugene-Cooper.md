### Occupation

Former President of the Federation

**Eugene Cooper** served as the President of the Federation from 3260 to 3264.^[1]^

Cooper's popularity declined over the first half his term, resulting in him being ousted by the mandatory mid-term vote of no confidence in Federal Congress in 3264. This provided then-Shadow President Antonia Madison the opportunity to form a new administration in a bid to succeed Cooper, which was approved by Congress.^[2]^

## Timeline

30 MAY 3301

- There is blood in the water and the politicians have begun hunting their prey. Yesterday, Shadow President Hudson placed a motion before Congress asking that they issue a Vote of No Confidence against President Halsey's administration. The motion was accepted, and the vote has been scheduled to take place on Monday afternoon. According to historic procedure, if a Vote of No Confidence in the encumbent President succeeds, then the Shadow President gets the chance to form an administration, which in turn is then put to a vote. If this fails, then a full congressional election is triggered. The Shadow President succeeding in these circumstances is not unheard of, but pretty rare. The last occasion was when the increasingly unpopular Eugene Cooper was ousted by the charismatic Antonia Madison in 3264 following a mid-term Vote of No Confidence.^[2]^
