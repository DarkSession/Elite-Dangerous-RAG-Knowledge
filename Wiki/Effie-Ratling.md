## Biography

At the INRA base Almeida Landing, her research team figured out how Thargoid hyperdrives worked to create stable wormholes. This was different than human drives which shifted space around a ship. She created a prototype hybrid hyperdrive.^[1]^

INRA took over the project, made some modifications and began immediate testing of the prototype. They kept Ratling as a consultant.^[1]^

The wormhole was stable, but she voiced concern about whether a human being would survive going through it. The pilot died when he returned from the wormhole, but the ship was unscathed. INRA launched an investigation, blamed Ratling for the accident and cancelled the project.^[1]^

She wanted to black-mail INRA so she could walk away or tell the world about Project Mycoid.^[1]^
