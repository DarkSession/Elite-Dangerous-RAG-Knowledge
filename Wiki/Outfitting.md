**Outfitting** is a service available at most Stations and Surface Ports that allows pilots to buy, sell, store, install, remove, and swap different weapon and equipment modules for their ship. All pilotable starships are upgradeable and have customizable components for a self-chosen career.^[1]^

If a station has an Outfitting service, it will always have Livery customisation as well. Outfitting is only accessible once a ship has been fully secured within a sealed hangar. If a pilot attempts to access Outfitting while docked on an un-retracted Landing Pad, this will automatically cause the Landing Pad to retract before the Outfitting menu opens.

## Weapons

    - *Main article: Ship Weapons*

Weapons provide a ship with offensive capabilities and are required for combat activities. All weapons come in one of three varieties: Fixed, Gimballed, and Turreted. Fixed weapons fire directly at the pilot's targeting reticle, are not affected by chaff, and are generally the cheapest and most damaging. Gimballed weapons can track target's within the pilot's line-of-sight, but can be temporarily rendered ineffective by chaff. Turreted weapons automatically track and attack any target within the weapon's line-of-sight, are also affected by chaff, and are generally the most expensive and least damaging.

Weapons also vary when it comes to the type of damage they inflict. Most weapons can only inflict one type of damage, but some can inflict two or three types at once.

- **Thermal** - Strong vs. shields, weak vs. armour.
- **Kinetic** - Weak vs. shields, strong vs. armour.
- **Explosive** - Very weak vs. shields, very strong vs. armour.
- **Absolute** - Ignores all shield and armour resistances.

A subset of weapons are mining tools, which are designed specifically for mining activities. They can technically still be used as weapons, but are extremely ineffective in combat.

## Equipment

    - *Main article: Equipment*

Equipment modules are all non-weapon modules. They range from vital functions such as Thrusters and Life Support to useful tools like Cargo Racks and the Fuel Scoop, as well as Utility modules.

Most equipment modules are available in five variants per class, denoted by the ratings E through A. 

Module grades
| Rating | Performance | Price | Power draw | Mass | Integrity | Niche |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E | Worst | Cheapest | Lowest | Balanced | Low | None |
| D | Poor | Cheap | Low | Lowest | Lowest | Exploration |
| C | Balanced | Balanced | Balanced | Balanced | Balanced | Best performance/price ratio |
| B | Good | Expensive | High | Highest | Highest | Combat |
| A | Best | Most expensive | Highest | Balanced | High | None |

Utility modules and other specialized modules Do not use the E-A rating system, as they are usually only available in one rating.

## Ship Module Slots

### Hardpoints

 	 	[![ED-Shop-Hardpoint-Outfitting-Weapons](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/52/ED-Shop-Hardpoint-Outfitting-Weapons.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20171028000434)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/52/ED-Shop-Hardpoint-Outfitting-Weapons.png/revision/latest?cb=20171028000434)

Hardpoints are mechanized mounts where weapons can be installed and then deployed from or retracted within a ship's hull. There are four classes of hardpoints: Small, Medium, Large, and Huge. Each class of hardpoint denotes the maximum class of weapon that can be installed there.

| Hardpoint Size | Max Weapon Class |
| --- | --- |
| Small | 1 |
| Medium | 2 |
| Large | 3 |
| Huge | 4 |

### Utility Mounts

Utility Mounts are slots on the exterior of a ship where specialised Utility modules can be installed. Unlike Hardpoints, they cannot be retracted, but this does not interfere with other ship functions. Ships have between 2 and 8 Utility Mounts. All available Utility modules are listed below:

| Module | Description | Credits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AX Xeno Scanner | Scan and identify Thargoid Interceptors and Scouts and Hunters |  |
| Chaff Launcher | Defend against gimballed and turreted weapons. |  |
| Electronic Countermeasure | Defend against hostile munitions with tracking capabilities |  |
| Frame Shift Wake Scanner | Scan Frame Shift Drive Wakes and reveal the destination system of a ship |  |
| Heatsink Launcher | Temporarily reduce a ship's heat levels. |  |
| Kill Warrant Scanner | Scan ships for any active bounties acquired in other jurisdictions. |  |
| Manifest Scanner | Scan other ships and identify any and all Commodities they are carrying |  |
| Point Defence Turret | Defend against hostile missiles, torpedoes, mines, and Hatch Breaker limpets. |  |
| Pulse Wave Analyser | Emits an energy pulse that briefly highlights any asteroids with lucrative deposits |  |
| Shield Booster | Increases shield strength by a given percentage of the base shield |  |
| Shutdown Field Neutraliser | Protects human ships from the temporary incapacitation by Thargoid Interceptor shutdown fields |  |

### Internal Compartments

    - *Main article: Internal Compartment*

Internal Compartments are module slots reserved for all other ship functions. They are divided into two types: Core Internals, which encompasses basic functions, and Optional Internals, which can expand the breadth of the ship's capabilities. A ship cannot operate without an appropriate module in each Core Internal slot, while Optional Internals can be left entirely empty if desired. Some Optional Internal compartments are restricted, and can only hold specific types of optional modules.

## Module Storage

Any module, whether Engineered or not, can be removed from a ship and stored at a station indefinitely at no cost. A pilot can store up to 600 total modules across all stations.

Since a ship requires all of its Core Internal modules to operate, if a pilot does not have a Core Internal module of the same type as they want to store already stored at a station that can be swapped into the ship, they are prompted to purchase and install an E-rated replacement first.

Stored modules can be transferred from one station with Outfitting to another for a fee. The fee and the transfer time vary depending on the distance between the two stations.

## Module Malfunction

| This section requires expansion with: More detailed information on effects of malfunctions and 0% health for more types of modules.
<br>*(2022-10-22)*<br> |
| --- |

When a module takes significant damage, it may begin to randomly malfunction while in use. The nature of these malfunctions depend on the module type. Additionally, modules that reach 0% health are typically disabled.

| Module type | Maximum health to start malfunctioning | Malfunction effect(s) | Effect(s) of module reaching 0% health |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frame Shift Drive | 80% | Ship spontaneously drops out of supercruise |  |
| Mining Laser, Beam Laser, Pulse Laser, Burst Laser | 80% | Fire Control Malfunction: Weapon continues to fire without input | Module is disabled |
| Missile Rack |  | Multiple Munitions Primed: Multiple missiles are fired from the rack at once. Seeker missiles and torpedos fired in this way will still track locked targets. |  |
| Power Plant |  | Power generation reduced to 40% for malfunction duration | Power generation reduced to 50% until repaired (malfunctions are still possible, during which power generation will be reduced to 20%)
<br>Further power plant damage has a chance to instantly destroy the ship regardless of hull integrity<br> |
| Thrusters (called "Drive" in target panel) |  |  | Ship completely loses directional and velocity control, and will continue moving and/or spinning until halted by collisions or until it is destroyed (or despawned in the case of NPC ships) |

## Notes

- Module Storage was originally capped at 60 modules. This was increased to 120 with *Elite Dangerous: Beyond* Chapter One (3.0), 200 with *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey* Update 7, and then 600 with *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey* Update 12.
