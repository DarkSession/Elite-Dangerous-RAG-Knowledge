Commodities Market
 		 	 

    - *Not to be confused with Goods.*

The human populated systems bustle with interstellar commerce. Many stations, settlements and Surface Ports require **Commodities**. They have fluctuating buy and sell rates which allow commanders to make money on the market. Most commodities are transported in Cargo Canisters which require Cargo Racks that are installed in ships.

Commodities can be bought and sold at any Station with a *Commodities Market* which is accessible via the *Starport Services* menu. To buy and sell illegal or stolen commodities, the commander must find a station with a Black Market. The availability of certain commodities can vary greatly per station. Generally, stations produce and consume commodities based on their Market Economy type. Commodity prices are dynamic and fluctuate based on various factors including player interaction. Trade routes and strategies can change on a daily basis, especially in areas with a high amount of player activity. The Background Simulation is directly impacted by trading.

Ambitious traders can make large amounts of credits by transporting commodities which they bought at a low price and sold at a higher price. Third Party Tools are useful to find trade routes throughout populated space.

- **Category:Commodities** - An automatically populating list of documented Commodities.
- **List of Rare Commodities** - There are various unique Rare Commodities that can only be purchased from specific stations. Rare Commodities increase in value the further away they are transported from the system of origin (up to 200 ly, after which the value ceases rising). See also: Category:Rare Commodities.
