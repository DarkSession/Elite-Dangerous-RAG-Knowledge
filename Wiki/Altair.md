**Altair** is a Federal system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It was first colonised between 2190 and 2230.^[1]^ Alongside Sol, Tau Ceti, Delta Pavonis, and Beta Hydri, it was one of the original signatories of the Federal Accord of 2242 and is regarded as a founding member of the Federation. Sometime in the 31st century, Apollo Rochester, the patriarch of the prestigious Rochester family, became the biggest landowner on the planet Biggs Colony.^[2]^ New Apollo City on that planet is undoubtedly named after him.^[3]^ Altair is the exclusive purveyor of the Rare Commodity Altairian Skin.
