Insignia of the Empire
 		 	 

The **Imperial Family**, also referred to as the **House of Duval**, comprises the members of the extended family of the reigning Emperor of the Empire.^[1]^ The House of Duval was founded in 2320 by Henson Duval, the first Emperor, and the Duval bloodline has reigned over the Empire in an unbroken succession to the present day and the current Emperor, Arissa Lavigny-Duval.

While the Emperor is the head of state and head of government of the Empire, only a few members of the Imperial Family get involved in politics, mostly by influencing and supporting friendly Senators from behind the scenes. Some members undertake public and official duties, others ceremonial and social duties, but are not involved in the government. These duties are passed down to their children.^[2]^

## Succession

By law, the Imperial Senate holds the power to debate and approve a new Emperor by a majority vote, and a candidate for the Imperial throne "must be of royal blood or of royal marriage" in order to be considered.^[3]^^[4]^ This theoretically means that an individual outside the Duval bloodline could become Emperor, and Senator Denton Patreus is thought to have made a subtle bid for the throne himself in 3301 when he commented that acclamation by the people was sufficient grounds for the Senate to approve a candidate. In practice, however, the role of Emperor has been so closely linked with the Duvals for so long that considering anyone other than a Duval would be highly unorthodox.

Historically, the succession to the Imperial Throne passed in the male line of the Imperial lineage. The eldest son of the emperor would ascend to the throne when the emperor passed away. Hengist Duval changed the laws of succession so that daughters of the Imperial line could also become Emperor. When Harold Duval was declared not sound of mind, this allowed Arissa Lavigny-Duval to become the 16th Emperor.

Presently, Emperor Arissa has no consort and no declared successor. The only other living members of the Imperial Family by blood are Arissa's niece and nephew, Princess Aisling Duval and Hadrian Augustus Duval, and Hadrian's son Hector Mordanticus Duval.

## Branches

The Loren "Lineage", which included the late Senator Algreb Loren and his daughter, Kahina Tijani Loren, was an Imperial noble family that was distantly related to the Duvals.^[5]^ The Lorens ruled from the Haoria system until 3297, when Algreb forcefully annexed the Prism system and relocated his family there. All of the Lorens with the exception of Kahina were murdered in a rebellion in Prism in 3300. Kahina inherited her father's position of Senator, but was convicted of an assassination attempt against Senator Denton Patreus in 3302 and stripped of rank and title. She avoided imprisonment by faking her death, but was killed in the Anumclaw system by a bounty hunter the following year. No other Lorens are known to survive, and the branch is presumed extinct.

## Funeral arrangements

By tradition, upon the death of a member of the Imperial Family who did not serve as Emperor, they are accorded a state funeral at the Hall of Martyrs on Capitol, where they lie in state for two weeks before being interred within the Hall. The funeral is preceded by a procession where the coffin is carried by members of the Imperial Guard, and marks the start a week-long period of official mourning throughout the Empire which concludes with a memorial ceremony at the Imperial Palace.^[6]^^[7]^ Funerals for Emperors differ in the scale and order of events.
