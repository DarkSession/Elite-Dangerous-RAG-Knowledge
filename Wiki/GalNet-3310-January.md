### Empire Continues ‘Protective Sanctuary’ for Abductees

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has decided that all Imperial citizens recovered from Thargoid Titans will remain in quarantine indefinitely.

An official pronouncement on behalf of the Emperor was distributed by the Imperial Palace:

“Every subject of the Empire who was abducted by the Thargoids is receiving the highest possible quality of treatment and support. The Emperor has ordered that they will be given exemplary medical and psychological care, for as long as they remain in medical isolation.”

“As is always the case, the security of our society is paramount. Protective sanctuary is being provided for tens of thousands of individuals, in order that billions are spared the prospect – however unlikely – of an alien influence taking root within the Empire. That is the honourable path, and the Emperor is confident her people will understand the wisdom of this decision.”

The Imperial Herald’s political journalist Cassia Carvalho analysed the ramifications:

“It is unusual for the actions of other superpowers to be acknowledged these days, but the issue of detaining Thargoid abductees has crossed all borders. In this case, the Alliance’s decision to allow them to return home has prompted Her Majesty to insist that keeping them in isolation is for the greater good.”

“Court insiders revealed that Princess Aisling Duval sought a personal audience with the Emperor, hoping to convince her to lift the quarantine. I’m told that this was refused in no uncertain terms, coupled with the suggestion that the Princess should focus her attention on her Aegis assignment.”

“The Imperial Palace also responded to Kamadhenu Medipure, which has called for all abductees to be relocated to deep space and possibly euthanised. The company was thanked for its ‘robust proposals’, but instructed to leave such considerations to the Senate.”

### Sirius CEO Faces Assembly Inquiry

Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corporation, has addressed the Alliance Assembly as part of its formal inquiry into the strategic defence pact.

The inquiry was proposed by Councillor Nakato Kaine, who highlighted the lack of military support provided by the megacorp against the Thargoids.

When invited to explain why most of Sirius Corporation’s plans have not materialised, Li Yong-Rui said:

“Many new anti-xeno ship configurations were designed for the Alliance Defence Force and have been applied to thousands of ships. But we have encountered many obstacles along the way, which have severely undermined our progress.”

“Usually these obstacles are bureaucratic in nature, but sometimes we simply cannot communicate effectively with the necessary individuals. I find it hard not to conclude that our progress is being deliberately impeded by forces within government departments. Sadly, not everyone shares Prime Minister Mahon’s vision of using our resources and expertise to enhance Alliance naval capabilities.”

Councillor Kaine directly challenged this statement, accusing Yong-Rui of failing to honour his responsibilities. He responded:

“May I remind the honourable councillor of her recent failed endeavour in the Tionisla system to ‘prove the Alliance doesn’t depend on Sirius’. While the Alliance is a powerful entity with considerable resources, the lack of engagement in Kaine’s campaign suggests Sirius’s involvement remains vital. Our company now handles many of the ADF’s routine logistical supplies, far more efficiently than before. Like it or not, we are here to stay.”

The inquiry into the strategic defence pact is expected to conduct more interviews within both Sirius Corporation and relevant Allied organisations. Admiral Nikolas Glass and other members of the Council of Admirals have also agreed to submit their observations.

### Zemina Torval Returns to the Senate

The Imperial Senate has formally welcomed back Senator Zemina Torval, following an absence of several months.

Torval’s reappearance put an end to rumours that she was suffering from ill health. Her youngest daughter, Senator Petra Torval, had been standing in for her mother by representing the Imperial populace of the Synteini system.

Addressing the Senate, Zemina Torval said:

“I am grateful to this august body, and to Her Majesty the Emperor, for permitting me a short respite from my duties. I have used this time to fully discharge my corporate responsibilities. As is common knowledge, ownership of Torval Mining Ltd has been transferred to my eldest daughter Constantia. She will ensure that Imperial industries continue to be supplied with vital mineral resources.”

“My attention is now fully focused on my senatorial work. This is where I have best served the Empire, and will continue to do so for many years to come.”

Cassia Carvalho, political correspondent for The Imperial Herald, observed:

“At 132 years old, Zemina Torval is one of the oldest serving members of the Senate. During her decades of service she has made many enemies, all of whom must have been deeply irritated to see her return, looking and sounding as formidable as ever.”

“The reason she avoided retirement could be that Chancellor Anders Blaine is considering taking that route for himself. Due to her seniority, Torval has temporarily deputised as chancellor on more than one occasion. If Blaine stands down and the most powerful position in the Senate becomes vacant, that would certainly justify Torval’s decision to focus exclusively on her political career.”

### Guardian Relics Needed for Anti-Titan Research

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The engineer Ram Tah requires urgent deliveries of Guardian relics and Unclassified relics to the Meene system.

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis, made an announcement to launch the initiative:

“Since the arrival of the Thargoid Titans, we have developed several new modules to bypass their defences. But these motherships remain a constant presence in our space, continuing to unleash never-ending swarms of Thargoid vessels.”

“A recent theory presented by Ram Tah has the potential to change this situation. Although details of his research remain classified for the moment, the theory is derived from the Thargoids’ inherent vulnerability to the technologies of their ancient enemy, the Guardians. Having witnessed Ram Tah’s laboratory tests only yesterday, I was hugely encouraged that his work could lead to the end of this devastating war.”

“Aegis is doing everything it can to support this crucial initiative. We therefore request deliveries of Guardian relics, as well as the Unclassified relics that are created when these crystalline objects are inserted into an ancient Thargoid surface site. Quantities of both objects are needed to rapidly refine Ram Tah’s theory and develop prototypes. Ram Tah has promised to reveal more details to the public should these prototypes succeed.”

Aegis has asked that Guardian relics and Unclassified relics be delivered to Felice Dock in the Meene system, the site of Ram Tah’s workshop.

### Winters Appoints Future Cabinet Members

President-elect Felicia Winters has officially selected new heads for each executive department of the Federal government.

She announced her choices during a session of Congress, where she gave a short speech about her upcoming presidency. This was followed by a similar statement from Isolde Rochester, who will serve as Winters’s vice president.

Sofia Trevino, political journalist for The Federal Times, reported:

“*With these appointments, Felicia Winters is laying the foundations on which to build a new Federal government. Long-serving figures in the Liberal Party are finally being rewarded with key positions in the upcoming administration*.”

“*One notable loyalist is Congressman Bai Zheng, who will be Secretary for Security. She is already well-known for opposing the Proactive Detection Bureau, and will undoubtedly take pleasure in overseeing the surveillance unit’s closure, as per Winters’s campaign promise*.”

“*Congressman Kristine Lasky is another familiar name. Her celebrated role in creating the Cornelius-Lasky Convention, which enables superpowers to collaborate during emergencies, makes her a solid choice for Secretary of State*.”

“*There are a few fresher faces among the forthcoming Cabinet. The new Grand Attorney will be Pierre-Marc Pelletier, a former director of the Federal Attorney’s Office. And the Secretary for Defence will be Congressman Conn Montgomery, who will have to navigate demands from a Federal Navy accustomed to Zachary Hudson’s generous military budgets*.”

In related news, planning is underway for Felicia Winters’s inauguration ceremony to take place in mid-February. President Hudson’s office has confirmed that handover procedures are well advanced, with all government agencies and departments preparing for the Federation’s new leadership.

### Guardian Deliveries Accelerate Anti-Titan Project

**\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\***

Shipments of Guardian relics and Unclassified relics have boosted hopes of developing a weapon against the Thargoid Titans.

The Aegis-led initiative gathered supplies of the crystalline relics left behind by the Guardian species, as well as the Unclassified relics that result when they interface with Thargoid surface sites.

These were requested to support a project based on new theories expounded by the engineer Ram Tah, considered the leading expert on Guardian history and technology.

Aden Tanner, who works as an anti-xeno strategist for Aegis, made a brief comment to Vox Galactica:

“*As always, we’re grateful to every pilot who took part to support Aegis. I don’t mind sharing that Ram Tah is delighted, and is currently refining his theory with the aid of specialists from all three superpowers*.”

“*We hope to reveal more details very soon, but at this point it’s worth managing expectations around the proposed anti-Titan weapon. It remains true that our existing armaments are incapable of inflicting damage on Thargoid motherships. But if Ram Tah is correct, we may be able to reveal certain vulnerabilities by exploiting a newly discovered aspect of Guardian technology*.”

A spokesperson from Aegis also revealed that Professor Palin is supporting Ram Tah’s research, stating: “*The most prominent engineers of our age are once again working together to defend humanity against the Thargoid threat*.”

Aegis has confirmed that all participants in the delivery campaign can now collect their rewards from Felice Dock in the Meene system.
