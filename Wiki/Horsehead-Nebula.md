Horsehead Nebula
 		 	 

The **Horsehead Nebula** is a nebula in the Inner Orion Spur approximately 900 ly away from Sol. It received its name because, when viewed from Sol, one of the dark clouds protruding against the brighter part of the nebula resembled a horse's head. Although the Horsehead Nebula is uninhabited, it is less than 150 ly away from the Witch Head Nebula, which contains a human enclave.
