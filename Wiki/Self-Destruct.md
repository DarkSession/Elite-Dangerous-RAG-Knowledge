# Self Destruct
Anaconda Self Destruct

**Self Destruct** starts a 30-second countdown to destroy the player's ship. It is activated by selecting the Self Destruct option on the Functions tab of the right-side Systems HUD.

Once activated, self destruct cannot be cancelled. The ship explodes after 30 seconds and the player will undergo Redeployment.

Self destruct cannot be activated while in supercruise.
