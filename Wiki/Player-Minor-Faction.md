## Find

You can search all approved in-game PMFs with these tools:

Player minor factions have a separate underused Elite Factions Wiki which is supposed to catalog all active player minor factions and their histories, lore, and system information.

## Manage

PMF should manage their minor faction's economy, influence, and other galactic threats. Take part in various activities: combat, missions, selling exploration data etc. Other Commanders can work with or against your minor faction. Therefore, your minor faction is subject to the actions and functions of the Background Simulation (BGS).^[1]^

## Inactive

Inactive PMS can be identified if they influence is static in a solitary system. If the PMF is in a few systems, but the influence in one has declined; that could be a sign of another faction trying to push them out or maybe it's Powerplay related. Or maybe it's a quiet system and they didn't submit data to INARA or EDSM. You can search online if there are any websites or social groups related to the PMF.

## Apply

In the past, Frontier allowed players to submit a player minor faction. If it was approved by Frontier then your player minor faction would show up in one of the three selected systems of your choosing and your minor factionâ€™s description be visible in a future update of Elite Dangerous.^[1]^ 

**Disclaimer**: You can no longer apply for a Player Minor Faction as applications were closed in early April 2023.^[2]^
