# Core Systems
The Core Systems highlighted in the Powerplay overview mode of the Galaxy Map
 		 	 

The **Core Systems** (aka the **Core Worlds**, **The Bubble**) are an ellipsoidal region of star systems approximately 200 light years in radius around Sol in the Inner Orion Spur that contains the bulk of human civilization in the Milky Way galaxy. It is where the Federation, Empire, Alliance, and other powers compete for influence, resources, territory, and control. The Core Systems occupy a volume of approximately 13.8 million cubic light-years that contains over 20,000 inhabited systems with more than 470,000 Starports, Outposts, Asteroid Bases, Surface Ports, and Settlements.

Human settlements are considerably rarer outside the bounds of the Core Systems. A few dozen isolated Asteroid Bases have been built in various nebulae. The Pleiades Nebula, California Nebula, Colonia Region, Witch Head Nebula, and Coalsack Nebula have become major hubs of expansion since the start of the 34th century. The Core Systems are also economically linked to the Colonia Region by the Colonia Connection Highway, a string of various stations and planetary outposts established along the main travel route between the two areas.

Previously, developing the required infrastructure to colonise new star systems was prohibitively expensive to the point of being limited to the Superpowers and sufficiently established Independent powers (often requiring assistance from independent pilots in the form of Community Goals, as with New Yembo and the Colonia Connection Highway). Following the launch of numerous Trailblazer ships by the Brewer Corporation in early 3311 (as well as a drive for emigration following the Second Thargoid War), the cost and complexity of inhabiting systems has dropped to the point that individual commanders can engage in the Colonisation of previously uninhabited systems. As a result the original Bubble itself is now far denser, while trails of new colonies run from its edges to nearby stellar regions, including the Pleiades, Coal Sack and California Nebulae, the Orion Complex and the historical edges of Guardian space.

## Territories

 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Location of the Core Systems in the Milky Way galaxy
 		 	 

The Core Systems are contested by many factions. The three largest are known as the superpowers and directly govern hundreds or thousands of systems each, while other burgeoning factions exert significant political and economic influence over superpower-controlled and independent systems alike.

- Superpowers
    - Alliance
    - Empire
    - Federation

- Other important factions/regions
    - EG Pilots
    - Kumo Crew
    - Marlinist Colonies
    - Old Worlds
    - Pilots' Federation District
    - Sirius Corporation
    - Utopia

## Sectors

All stars in the Milky Way are catalogued into sectors, and the Core Systems occupy a volume that encompasses 28 different sectors in whole or in part. Of these, the Col 285 and Synuefe sectors are by far the largest, and extend well beyond Core Systems' boundaries. All Core Systems sectors are listed below, with significant systems inside those sectors noted in parentheses:

## Boundaries

The Core Systems' ellipsoidal shape can be seen by using the Powerplay overview mode of the Galaxy Map, but the true frontiers of the Core Systems extend slightly beyond the volume of systems affected by Powerplay. By using Sol (coordinates 0,0,0) to designate the center point of the Core Systems and following the XYZ axes of the Galaxy Map, certain systems can be used to identify the six approximate outermost points of the region.

On the X axis:

- X+: Velniat
- X-: Col 285 Sector OY-R d4-62
- Distance between both points: ~398ly

On the Y axis:

- Y+: HIP 83506
- Y-: Shu Babassi
- Distance between both points: ~595ly

On the Z axis:

- Z+: Pand
- Z-: HIP 26761
- Distance between both points: ~393ly

The Bubble, 2014
 		 	 

The Bubble had a small pill-like shape around Sol and Achenar during the beta in October 2014. That was the whole playable area. Beta testers with early access could not go beyond that area.^[1]^
