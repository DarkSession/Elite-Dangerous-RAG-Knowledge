> 
> 
> As the only daughter of a prosperous entrepreneur, Terra was born into extraordinary wealth. But a highly rebellious streak led her to reject the familial expectations placed upon her. She fled home, falling in with an antiauthoritarian group that engaged in a string of daring robberies. One failed heist and a decade of incarceration later, Terra operates an independent workshop and claims to have left her criminal past behind.
