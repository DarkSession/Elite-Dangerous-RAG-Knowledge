**Deep Plating** is an Experimental Effect which can be applied to modules through Engineering. It increases the ship's structural integrity (How much damage can be dealt) at the cost of lower resistances for all types of damage (the multiplier for the damage inflicted, e.g a resistance of 50% will half the damage).

Deep Plating could be used in conjunction with Heavy Duty Armour to increase the effect, or if collisions are your main cause of Hull damage.
