**Thargoid Bio-Storage Capsules** are a legal Salvage Commodity. These capsules can be extracted from Thargoid Titans using a Sub-surface Extraction Missile.^[1]^ They can also be found at the debris field of a destroyed Titan.

Thargoid Bio-Storage Capsules were designed by the Thargoids to store humans they have abducted. These capsules do not inflict any corrosive damage, so it is safe to store these in standard Cargo Racks. Thargoid Bio-Storage Capsules can be handed in to a Search and Rescue Agent for a credit reward.  

Thargoid Scythes will attempt to collect Bio-Storage Capsules using Scythe Collection Drones.
