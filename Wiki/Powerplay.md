# Powerplay
- *Not to be confused with Powerplay (bonds) or Merits.*

> 
> 
>  At the height of humanities history in the 34th century, the political landscape was dominated by three Superpowers: The Federation led by democratically elected Presidents, their long-time warring rivals, the Empire, dynastically maintained by hereditary monarchies, and the Alliance which emerged from a much larger coalition of independent systems united politically by a desire for stability. 
> 
> Whilst these Superpowers were a dominating force, they were not themselves unified. Each Superpower was itself built from sub-factions known as Powers. Even though these Powers may have been ideologically aligned in some cases their charismatic leaders also had their own agendas. These tensions between Powers, and indeed Superpowers, led to an era of territorial conflict. This was known as Powerplay.

## Overview

 	 	[![Elite Dangerous Powerplay Bubble](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/f/fa/Elite_Dangerous_Powerplay_Bubble.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20170205090026)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/f/fa/Elite_Dangerous_Powerplay_Bubble.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170205090026) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
The Core Systems is where powers compete for influence, resources, territory and control.
 		 	 

Powerplay represents the machinations of powerful individuals (aka powers) and organizations that strive to control inhabited space for their own agendas. At its heart, Powerplay is a battle for territory. Each Power attempts to expand into systems, extracting resources from them in order to pay for continued expansion and protect systems already being exploited. As commanders of space ships, players can pledge support to a power and carry out tasks for them in return for rewards and prestige.^[5]^

The Core Systems (aka the Bubble) is a sphere of about 150 light years around Sol with 19,000 inhabited systems where powers compete for influence, resources, territory and control. The territory volume is about 13.8 million cubic light years.

### Notable powers

    - *Main article: Power*

There are 12 notable powers.

| Name | Headquarters | Allegiance | Preparation Ethos | Expansion Ethos | Control Ethos | Symbol |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Powers and Factions

Powers are distinct from minor and major factions.

- **Minor factions** generally control individual areas of space within a system. Whichever minor faction holds the main station of a system rules the system. Their holdings within a system are determined by their influence and any conflicts that arise.
- **Major factions** are huge super powers that control vast swathes of inhabited space. There are three: the Alliance, Empire, and Federation. Many, but not all, minor factions align themselves with major factions, adopting their laws and customs.
- **Powers** sit between major and minor factions in terms of scope. They don't directly rule, but they can hold sway over dozens if not hundreds of systems, or just a mere handful.

While many powers are aligned directly with major factions, being Imperial nobility or senators, or politicians within the Federation or Alliance, others are not, being independent entities.

Importantly, even when a Power is aligned with a major faction this does not prevent it scheming against its “allies”. Ultimately, every Power stands alone.

## Process of Powerplay

 	 	[![Elite-Dangerous-Official-Powerplay-Banner-Xavier-Henry](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/a/a5/Elite-Dangerous-Official-Powerplay-Banner-Xavier-Henry.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20170714183858)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/a/a5/Elite-Dangerous-Official-Powerplay-Banner-Xavier-Henry.png/revision/latest?cb=20170714183858) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Official Powerplay banner
 		 	 

There are three elements to Powerplay, called Ethos. These are preparation, expansion and control.

In the first instance, a target system must be prepared for expansion. This preparation may involve different tasks for supporters to complete, depending on the Power involved.

Once a system has been successfully prepared, an expansion attempt may be purchased for the next cycle. Again, different powers require their supporters to carry out different tasks to successfully prosecute expansion.

Supporters of other powers may directly oppose expansion making success even more difficult to achieve. Once a system has been expanded into, supporters may fortify it to reduce its drain on the power’s CC reserves.

Supporters of other powers may undermine control systems making them more expensive to maintain and more likely to revolt.

### Preparation

If you have pledged support to a power, you can prepare systems for expansion. The details of the preparation tasks required of you are described in the details of the preparation tab in the Powerplay interface.

Any system may be prepared for expansion with the following caveats:

- The system must be inhabited
- The system must not be a control system for a power
- The system must not be an exploited system for a different power

In addition, each target system has an expansion cost. This expansion cost will be deducted from the power’s CC reserve at the end of the cycle if the system is chosen for an expansion attempt. A system cannot be prepared if its expansion cost is greater than the power’s current CC reserve.

### Top Ten Systems

Although any amount of systems may be prepared, a Power is limited each cycle to purchasing no more than 10 expansion attempts. Importantly, its choices are based on the amount of preparation carried out at a system, not the system’s expansion cost.

The Top 10 Systems listing shows several things:

- The total PREP so far this cycle for that top 10 system.
- The range from your ship to that system in lightyears (LY)
- The COST column shows in White color those systems that your Power will purchase expansion attempts in order from 1 to 10 until your Powers Command Capital (CC) for the cycle has run out. The first system highlighted in Red color shows the point on the listing at which the CC to spend that cycle will run out and no further systems in the listing can be afforded for expansion, those also highlighted in Red.^[6]^

All systems have a preparation threshold. Until supporters have completed enough preparation tasks to breach this threshold the system cannot be a top ten entry.

### Multiple Preparation

More than one Power can prepare a system at the same time. In such cases, at the end of the cycle the Power which completed the most preparation gets to purchase an expansion attempt whilst all other preparation fails.

Preparation can occur for multiple powers in systems that would be within each other’s potential 15 light year exploitation radius.

In such cases, at the end of the cycle the Power which completed the most preparation gets to purchase an expansion attempt whilst all other preparation fails.

### Preparation and the Galaxy Map

 	 	[![Bubble](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/9/9b/Bubble.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20170605214018)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/9/9b/Bubble.png/revision/latest?cb=20170605214018) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
The Bubble in the galaxy
 		 	 

You can use the galaxy map to help you view potential candidates for preparation, by selecting the “Powerplay” view, choosing your Power from the drop down selection then activating the “Expansion” filter.

The Expansion view shows all systems outside your control with the following identification markers:

- Colour is used to denote value of a system if it was controlled:
    - Green are the most profitable, red are the least profitable, orange are average
    - Grey systems would actually cost CC upkeep to maintain, even after all the income had been harvested from exploited systems
- Hollow systems cannot be prepared, for one of the following reasons:
    - The upkeep cost is greater than the powers entire CC reserve that cycle
    - Another power is controlling the system
    - Another power is exploiting the system
    - Another power is attempting an expansion that would cause the system to be exploited if it is successful
- Systems that are uninhabited are not displayed at all

Top ten preparation entries are displayed in the powerplay galaxy map when the “expansion” filter is active. Each such system has a number entry above it, denoting its top ten preparation status.

Rolling over or selecting a system summons an information panel giving more details as well as highlighting all systems that would be exploited if this were a control system.

### Getting Started

#### Merits

 	 	[![Sample PowerPlay 2.0 weekly missions](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/b1/Sample_PowerPlay_2.0_weekly_missions.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20241021094503)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/b1/Sample_PowerPlay_2.0_weekly_missions.png/revision/latest?cb=20241021094503) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
An example of a Power's weekly missions. At the time of this article's writing, all the weekly assignment missions appear to be the same from power to power.
 		 	 

Merits are essentially "reward points" that are earned through various in-game actions and affect a power's standing in the system they were earned in. While a CMDR earns merits, they will gain ranks once they complete an initial 5 missions for their power. Each rank grants the CMDR a combination of new / incrementally enhanced benefits. Merits in PowerPlay 2 are earned immediately. If you defect to another power then your merit progression is reset.^[7]^^[8]^

#### Rank progression

 	 	[![Sample Power Ranks-1](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/6f/Sample_Power_Ranks-1.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20241021094221)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/6f/Sample_Power_Ranks-1.png/revision/latest?cb=20241021094221) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
An example of a power's ranks, taken from Nakato Kaine's ranks.
 		 	 

All powers have the same rank progression requirements:^[9]^

Collapse| **Rank** | **Merit** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 0 merits, completion of the five initial weekly missions |
| 2 | 2,000 merits |
| 3 | 5,000 merits |
| 4 | 9,000 merits |
| 5 | 15,000 merits |
| 6+ | +8,000 merits per Rank (ex: Rank 8 would require 39,000 merits) |
| 10 | 55,000 merits |
| 20 | 135,000 merits |
| 30 | 215,000 merits |
| 40 | 295,000 merits |
| 50 | 375,000 merits |
| 60 | 455,000 merits |
| 70 | 535,000 merits |
| 80 | 615,000 merits |
| 90 | 695,000 merits |
| 100 | 775,000 merits |
| 100+ | +8,000 merits per Rank (ex: Rank 130 would require 1,015,000 merits) |

#### Figuring out where to work next

The power play mode in the galaxy map contains two sub-modes to help you plot your next move as a power player: the powerplay mode and Powerplay activity filter. The powerplay mode allows a CMDR to filter systems in the galaxy map by power(s) and a system's state. The Powerplay activity filter mode allows a CMDR to filter systems by a specific power, then by specific activity type, and then by a minimum activity level.

When selecting a system in the galaxy map, it is also possible to toggle strategic view for that system. This will highlight all systems in it's control range and, in the case of exploited systems, all systems it is in range of receiving support from. It will also show non-power systems and front line systems in range of it.

## Mechanics

### System States

A system can be in one of six states:^[10]^

|  | **Icon** | **State** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Acquisition* |
| **1** |  | **Uncontrolled** | These are systems that are not controlled by any power and are candidates for a power to expand into. |
| **2** |  | **Expansion** | These are systems your power is actively trying to expand into. Multiple powers can attempt to expand into a given system at the same time. The first power to reach the control threshold by the end of a cycle will gain control of the system and it will move into the Exploited state. However, if two or more powers reach the conflict threshold for a system, they will enter a conflict for it and the system will move to the Contested state. |
| **3** |  | **Contested** | These are systems where two or more powers are trying to expand into and have reached the expansion threshold. A conflict will ensure the following cycle, the victor of which will expand into the system as an exploited system. |
| *Reinforcement* |
| **4** |  | **Exploited** | These systems are under the lowest level of control by a power. Stations will start to show some of the power's branding and propaganda. These systems cannot be expanded from by a power and must be supported by at least one Fortified or Stronghold system. These systems can be reinforced through power ethos appropriate actions. Once an Exploited system is reinforced enough, it will become a Fortified system at the start of the next cycle.  If there are no Fortified or Stronghold systems supporting an Exploited system by the end of a Powerplay cycle, then the power will lose control of the Exploited system and it will fall back to the Uncontrolled state. |
| **5** |  | **Fortified** | These systems are at the next level of a power's control. Stations will now show more of the power's branding and propaganda. These systems can be expanded from for a distance of up to 20 Ly away, as well as support exploited systems in the same range.^[9]^ It is not yet known whether Powerplay commodities can be acquired through a Fortified system's stations or starports.^*[citation needed]*^ These systems can be reinforced through power ethos appropriate actions. Once a Fortified system is reinforced enough, it will become a Stronghold system at the start of the next cycle. If a Fortified system is sufficiently undermined in a cycle, it will drop down to an Exploited state, which may cause the power to lose control of any Exploited systems that were being supported by this system. It is not yet known if a Fortified system that is not in range of another Fortified or Stronghold system will automatically be lost if it drops down to an Exploited state.^*[citation needed]*^ |
| **6** |  | **Stronghold** | These systems are at the highest level of a power's control. Stations will now show their power's branding and propaganda everywhere. These systems can be expanded from for a distance of up to 30 Ly away, as well as support exploited systems in the same range.^[9]^ Powerplay commodities can also be acquired through a Stronghold system's stations and starports. Furthermore, Stronghold systems are candidates for hosting a Stronghold Carrier. These systems can be reinforced through power ethos appropriate actions. If a Stronghold system is sufficiently undermined in a cycle, it will drop down to a Fortified state, which may cause the power to lose control of any Exploited systems that were being supported by this system. If this system was hosting a Stronghold Carrier, that carrier will leave. There is one notable exception: a power's home system is always a Stronghold system and cannot be either reinforced or undermined. |

 	 	[![Sample Powerplay 2.0 tug of war ui](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/0/01/Sample_Powerplay_2.0_tug_of_war_ui.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20241027090931)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/0/01/Sample_Powerplay_2.0_tug_of_war_ui.png/revision/latest?cb=20241027090931) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
An example of the new tug-of-war UI
 		 	 

A system can only change one state per cycle. For example, an Exploited system can only be reinforced to a Fortified system in one cycle and a Stronghold system can only be undermined to a Fortified system in one cycle.

The ease or difficulty of a power expanding into a system or reinforcing / defending a system is determined by several factors, including:^[9]^ 

1. How far away from the power's home system. The farther away a system is from the power's home system, the harder it is to protect.
2. The fortification level of the system. The more fortified a system is, the harder it is to attack.
3. How high the population in that system is. The more population there is in a system, the harder it is to influence in either direction.
4. How far away from the power's "frontline" (nearest fortified or stronghold system) is. Attacking systems at the edge of a power's control will be easier than trying to attack systems deep inside their territory.

### Stronghold Carriers

 	 	[![Stronghold Carrier Group - 1920x1080](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/7b/Stronghold_Carrier_Group_-_1920x1080.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20241101025731)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/7b/Stronghold_Carrier_Group_-_1920x1080.png/revision/latest?cb=20241101025731) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
A stronghold carrier surrounded by its support fleet
 		 	 

A stronghold carrier is a special "miniture fleet carrier" that only members of the same power can dock at. Stronghold carriers offer access to improved outfitting and shipyard inventories when compared to most ports. They are accompanied by a small flotilla of supporting megaships, which can be attacked, hacked, or pirated from by members of an opposing power for merits and other goodies. They can also be repaired by members of the same power. They are only found in stronghold systems that are (1) highest rated in that faction and (2) not in the sphere of influence of another Stronghold Carrier owned by that faction.^[11]^

### Power Contacts

 	 	[![Powerplay 2.0 power contact](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/9/95/Powerplay_2.0_power_contact.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/260?cb=20241027073528)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/9/95/Powerplay_2.0_power_contact.png/revision/latest?cb=20241027073528) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Powerplay 2 contact
 		 	 

Power contacts can be found at almost every space station or surface port. Depending on the state of the system, you can pick up and drop off power commodities here. Power commodities can be picked up in quantities dependent on your rank with the power^*[citation needed]*^. You can also drop of salvage, escape pods, personal effects, and claim any care packages you have earned. You can also claim bounties for a +25% bonus to your payout. It is not known at this time whether (1) you will gain extra merits for doing this or (2) if the minor faction you collected the bounties for will gain a BGS bonus for this.^*[citation needed]*^

### Power Benefits

#### Universal Benefits

- Up to a 100% reduction in rebuy costs when killed by an opposing power.
- Up to a 100% reduction in rebuy when killed in your power's territory.
- Rank decals.^[12]^

#### Rank Benefits

 	 	[![Small care package contents](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/8/84/Small_care_package_contents.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20241101141912)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/8/84/Small_care_package_contents.png/revision/latest?cb=20241101141912) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Example of a care package (Jerome Archer)
 		 	 

All powers unlock modules and power-specific rewards at the same ranks, with all other ranks rewarding CMDRs with either a mini-care package or a full care package^*[citation needed]*^.

#### Power Module Unlock Matrix

Each power unlocks all power modules eventually, but in different orders. Every power unlocks their unique module first at rank 34. Which power module unlocks next varies from there^[13]^. Below is a table showing at what rank each power's module becomes available to a CMDR:

## Powerplay activities

This summary of Powerplay Activities is based on the Pilot's Handbook and info panels in the Galaxy map, collated, and summarised by Nowski on the official forum. ^[14]^. It has been edited for Wiki formatting and length considerations. It was last compared in depth with the forum version on 2 Nov 2025.

### Known Issues

In the weeks and months prior to June 12, 2025 huge amounts of on-foot powerplay data have been used to undermine systems under the control of Yuri Grom and Jerome Archer, centering around Fong Wang (Grom), Sol, and CE Bootis (both Archer), culminating in an undermining control score of 1.8 million to undermine Sol. This led to Frontier Developments temporarily deactivating merit and system control score gains for powerplay data once again until a solution will have been found^[16]^. Frontier attempts to revert the scores of the affected systems back to what they were before this exploit occurred on the next weekly server maintenance on June 19. It remains unclear as of now which systems will be reverted.

### Care warning

Some activities are particularly confusing and lack full documentation.

- "Exploration data" refers to Cartographic data only, not exobiology.
    - Merits are awarded per body, not per system, and will only be awarded to bodies above an unknown but high threshold.
    - The best bets are Water Worlds, Earth-Like Worlds, and Ammonia Worlds.
    - Hand in the system data which contains those worlds \*individually\*, do not use the "screen" method.

## Detailed Guide for activities and effects

Powerplay activities are grouped according to who controls the system which they affect. Check carefully for the correct location if you are required to hand something in, this is sometimes a controlling system different to where you collected the item or data. Sometimes there are additional requirements, noted alongside the activity.

### Types of target systems

There are three main types of target system:

| **Types of target systems** | **Types of target systems** | **Types of target systems** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type |  | Abbreviation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Acquisition** | The target is currently not controlled by any Power, and close enough to one of your Power's fortified or stronghold systems that your activity can help your Power to gain control (20LY for Fortified, 30LY for Stronghold.) | AS (Acquisition System) |
| **Reinforcement** | The target is currently controlled by your Power. Your activity can progress it from Exploited to Fortified to Stronghold and resist attempts of other Powers to weaken and control it. | RS (Reinforcement System) |
| **Undermining** | The target is currently controlled by an enemy Power. Your activity can weaken the enemy Power's control. If the system is weakened to a lower control level, enemy control of nearby systems might be lost. | US (Undermine System) |

All the activities listed below *should* earn merits for all pledged players when done in the right system type as shown. (modulo bugs and documentation errors).

Additionally, Powers favour particular activities and will award bonus merits (50% has been suggested) according to their 'Power Ethos'. Those Powers are indicated alongside their Ethos activities as follows:

- **A**: Aisling Duval
- **ALD**: Arissa Lavigny-Duval
- **D**: Archon Delaine
- **DP**: Denton Patreus
- **EM**: Edmund Mahon
- **FW**: Felicia Winters
- **JA**: Jerome Archer
- **LYR**: Li Yong-Rui
- **NK**: Nakato Kaine
- **PA**: Pranav Antal
- **YG**: Yuri Grom
- **ZT**: Zemina Torval

**Other abbreviations:**

- **CS**: Controlled system - any system controlled by your Power
- **Supporting system**: a Fortified or Stronghold system where the target system is inside its control range (20LY for Fortified, 30LY for Stronghold)
- **PC**: Power Contact - Contact for your Power via the contacts section in port menu
- **Enemy**: vessel or personnel aligned with a different Power to you
- **Ody**: the activity is an Odyssey (on-foot) task, done at Odyssey settlements
- **BUG?**: likely bugged in some way, and more information is needed

### Undermining vulnerabilities

Each power is weak to up to two additional undermining activities in systems they control. **Note**: The activity may already be an Undermine activity for your Power. Occasionally, in this case, the activity is shown twice in "local activities" in the powerplay info panel for the system.

## Tips & tricks

This sections has various strategies and shortcuts that commanders can use to do things more efficiently or effectively (e.g. off-nav beacon undermining in PowerPlay 1.0).

#### Reinforce existing systems

###### Tips and tricks

- Camp at a station and blow up any power ships you find there. They are nice and squishy and yield anywhere between 36 -- 81 merits per kill, or more even. You can easily get ~500  merits in a few minutes this way before cleaning the instance of power ships. When all the power ships are gone, just jump out of the station instance and return to get a new instance and repeat until done reinforcing.
    - Watch your aim: the station murder guns will shoot you if you hit either the station or a non power ship.
- You can off-nav beacon or in-place power hunt to have power and wanted ships spawn. See the entry in undermining for details.

#### Undermine other powers' systems

###### Tips and Tricks

- You can drop past the nav beacon of a system to spawn Power ships. This is called off-nav beacon undermining. Since the same trick can be done to reinforce a system, this whole process will be called "off-nav beacon power hunting". It is a reliable and safe way to spawn power ships for undermining.
    - Important: in Powerplay 2, you must drop at least 120km away from the nav beacon for this to work. Dropping closer than that will not cause power ships to spawn.
    - You can get into position faster by first dropping at the nav beacon normally, then supercruising out at minimum SC speeds to start the off-nav beacon dropping process.
    - Because you need to drop beyond 120km from the nav beacon, it is best to set your low wakes to be parallel to the nav beacon so you can drop sooner.
- Similar to off-nav beacon power hunting, you can drop anywhere in a system for a chance for power ships to spawn. This is called in-place power hunting.

## Power influence on BGS

It is not known at this time what impact---if any---a power's presence in a system has on the system's Background Simulation (BGS). Most likely, there will no longer be a direct BGS impact caused by a Power's presence in the system. Whether certain traits of a power's presence in a system as found in PowerPlay 1.0 will continue in PowerPlay 2.0 is not yet known. It is known that a system's controlling faction's government type no longer influences a power's hold on a system or their overall rating. For example, a dictatorship controlling a system held by Jerome Archer or Arissa Lavigny-Duval no longer makes a system easier to undermine. Conversely, a Patronage or Feudal government controlling a system held by one of these two powers no longer makes the system harder to undermine.^[7]^

## Development

Powerplay was formally announced to launch as the third major free content updates for Elite Dangerous.^[2]^ It was released on June 5, 2015.^[18]^

Powerplay 2 is a full rework and released on 31 October 2024.^[4]^ Version 2 removed the following:^[19]^

- Merit degradation
- Voting system for expansions
- Defection effects (leaving a Power now only resets your progression)
- Connections to government types
