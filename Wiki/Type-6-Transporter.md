> Manufactured by Lakon Spaceways, the Type-6 Transporter is seen by many independent pilots as a natural progression from the versatile Cobra Mk III. When appropriately outfitted, the ship offers sufficient cargo space for the profitable trading of standard commodities, precluding the need to transport rare commodities long distances. The Type-6 has limited combat ability, however, and pilots who expect conflict are advised to upgrade the ship's shields and hull.

The **Type-6 Transporter** is a medium produced ship manufactured by Lakon Spaceways. One of five dedicated freighters in the Lakon family, the Type-6 is considered an entry-level vessel for traders and is primarily designed for hauling commodities. This ship requires a medium Landing Pad, and unlike the larger Type-7 Transporter, Type-9 Heavy, and Type-10 Defender, it can dock at an Outpost, allowing it access to a wider range of markets than its more expensive counterparts. Pilots making their first trading runs have come to appreciate the Type 6 Transporter's reliability, which has helped many on the path to amassing their fortunes.

## Overview

The Type-6 Transporter is the cheapest medium ship on the market and an amazing trader. It is considered the next step up in terms of cargo capacity from the multipurpose Cobra Mk III. When fitted for maximum cargo capacity, which can reach 114 tonnes, many traders find that the Type-6 becomes quite suited for trading standard commodities in bulk rather than hauling rare commodities in long jump distances. After upgrading the Frame Shift Drive to increase its jump range, the Type-6 Transporter is better at hauling commodities in long jump distances.

The Type-6 Transporter has also found a niche as an exploration vessel; when stripped of all unnecessary weight and stocked with an upgraded frame shift drive, the Type-6 Transporter can reach jump ranges just short of the Asp Explorer at a much lower cost, though it is significantly less capable of defending itself than an Asp Explorer should it encounter a hostile vessel. It is still almost three times more expensive than the Cobra MK III, which can also be used for exploration. Because of its high Compartment count, it is capable of holding more fuel and a bigger fuel scoop and is better at Passenger missions.

In combat, the Type-6 is second only to the Hauler as the worst ship in the role. It has the same hardpoints as the Sidewinder but has much lower mobility and thus cannot evade fire or keep its fixed hardpoints on a target nearly as well and also attracts much more dangerous vessels than the Sidewinder would. Its low maneuverability also makes it more vulnerable to interdiction. Its advantage is it can be quite hardy, its shields and armour are rather good for its price so it can often take hits, though this requires lowering the cargo capacity. The Type-6 has a deceptively low Mass Lock Factor of 8, meaning most ships can mass lock it. Jumping to another system to flee combat is advised due to this, as mass-locking will not occur. If one wishes to take down oncoming enemy pirates while still making some profit from trade the Keelback is a much better option.

Type-6 hardpoints convergence
 		 	 

The weapon hardpoints are located as follows: two bottom mounted Class 1 hardpoints on either side of the ship, separated by a central ridge. This layout makes it relatively easy to keep the ship's weapons trained on its target, but the Type-6's aforementioned poor performance in combat roles make it more likely that the owner will be equipping mining tools than weapons if they choose to install hardpoints at all.

## Notes

- Prior to v1.2, the Type-6 had a tendency to overheat, to 100% or greater, making fuel scooping and consecutive hyperspace jumps more risky unless an A-rated power plant was also used (reducing the average maximum heat to 95%). This was especially dangerous because the cargo hatch module tends to take a lot of heat damage which can lead to a malfunction causing cargo to jettison. As of v1.2, this tendency has been corrected and the ship now runs much cooler, making it less likely to suffer heat damage.
