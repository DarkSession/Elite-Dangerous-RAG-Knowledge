Aegis Core member (formerly)

**Dr. Mia Valencourt** is a scientist who formerly worked for Aegis Core, a division of Aegis. She was originally stationed in Socho, where Aegis Core ran the Eagle Eye installation that monitored for Thargoid activity, but was forced to flee the system with her colleagues after it was overrun by a criminal syndicate called the Socho Gold Raiders in May 3304. In July 3307, Valencourt and other senior Aegis members were forced to resign from their positions after an independent investigation was opened into the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the Aegis megaship Alexandria.

## Timeline

11 AUG 3307

- An investigation into the tri-superpower organisation Aegis is seeking to establish the reasons for its failures. Dr Paul Baumann, chair of the independent board of inquiry, outlined its scope: "The initial phase is to fully understand the work of Aegis, before examining strategic and operational decisions. Interviews with senior staff have been scheduled, with Admiral Aden Tanner providing details on military activity. One specific area of attention is the lost megaship Alexandria. We are performing a thorough analysis, including background checks on its crew. Hyperspace physicists are theorising probable causes for its failure to arrive at HIP 30944. We will be raising issues of culpability, specifically whether the concentration of Guardian artefacts aboard the Alexandria directly led to systems coming under Thargoid attack. Other incidents will be reviewed to identify possible grounds for negligence." Many prominent figures within Aegis have resigned including Professor Alba Tesreau, Director Yazhu Xing and Dr Mia Valencourt. All active projects have been suspended, with routine activities continuing under independent observation. Some politicians in all three superpowers have protested against the inquiry, concerned about weakening defences against the Thargoids. Others believe Aegis is not fit for purpose, calling for a more localised approach to anti-xeno operations.^[1]^

30 MAY 3304

- The Socho system, headquarters of Aegis Core, has been overtaken by a criminal faction. The system is now in a state of anarchy. A courier carrying a message from Aegis scientist Dr Mia Valencourt managed to escape the system. The message was then broadcast by the Rewired news service: "This is an urgent call for assistance. Regional security forces have been overrun, and this vicious gang – they call themselves the Socho Gold Raiders – they're in charge now. They’ve shut everything down. Apparently they're convinced we're building some kind of super-weapon, so that's probably what brought them here. They were so clever. We picked up what looked like a Thargoid signal and the security forces went charging in. Everyone was terrified that the Thargoids had come to Socho. But it wasn’t the Thargoids – it was a trap. The Raiders were waiting, and they cut those ships to pieces. Please, if anyone's listening, this is an emergency. It's absolute chaos here. Please help!" Professor Alba Tesreau, Aegis's chief scientific advisor, made an emotional plea: "It is inconceivable that elements of our own society would behave this way when there's so much at stake. There is vital research taking place at Aegis Core. If it's lost, these criminals will have placed all of us at risk! I implore the galactic community to help free Socho from these unthinking vandals. Aegis is defending humanity against the Thargoid threat. We need your help to survive, so that we in turn can protect you and your families."^[2]^
