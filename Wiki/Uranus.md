**Uranus** is the 7th and coldest planet in the Sol system. Temperatures on its surface, mainly composed of icy gases such as Ammonia and Methane, can reach an icy -371° F. Uranus' extreme axial tilt of nearly 90°  means it orbits Sol on its side. It possesses a thin ring system, thinner than Saturn but thicker than Jupiter.
