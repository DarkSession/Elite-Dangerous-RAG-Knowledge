A **Collared Pod** is a non-sentient, spacefaring entity that inhabits Lagrange Clouds. It appears to be a plant-like organism with multiple bioluminescent spots on either side of its body. While it does not visibly react to light, if a ship approaches it, it will constantly alter its position so that one of its sides is facing the ship.^[1]^
