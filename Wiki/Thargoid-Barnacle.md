A **Thargoid Barnacle** is an organic Thargoid structure that extracts resources from a planet and converts them into Meta-Alloys, a key component in Thargoid ships and technologies.^[1]^ The main structure consists of an organic growth with a central, ribbed peak surrounded by Thargoid Barnacle Barbs. The first Barnacles were documented in the Pleiades Nebula and California Nebula in 3302, and additional sites were discovered in the Witch Head Nebula in 3305 and the Coalsack Nebula in 3306.

## Appearance

At first sight the central column looks very much like a regular, sea-based barnacle sitting on the ground. However, closer up, it appears to consist of a number of individual obelisks making up the structure. At ground level the obelisks do not quite meet, leaving gaps through which a more organic looking material can be seen which radiates a blue-green light. It is approximately twice the height of a Scarab SRV.

The peaks of each obelisk is coloured a creamy white, with a strange symbol visible on the side. This is currently the cause of much speculation amongst commanders with many believing it to be a reference to Barnard's Loop, an emission nebula in the Orion constellation.

## Large Clusters

After September 26, 3303, CMDRs began discovering much larger clusters of Alien Structures aka "Barnacles". These clusters had grown into a roughly octagonal shape, with crystal-like formations erupting from the ground and linking them together. It is possible that these large clusters are the precursors of future Thargoid Surface Sites. It's also called a Barnacle Forest due to the large scale.^[2]^

## Interaction

Thargoid Barnacles have thus far been entirely unresponsive to all attempts at communication as well as attacks, and they are also impervious to damage. Ships and SRVs cannot directly target them, and they do not appear on scanners.

When nearby, a strange sound can be heard coming from it, which sounds similar to an Unknown Artefacts, but rather sounds more like an animal noise.^[3]^

### Connection to Thargoids

On June 2, 3303, CMDR Mobiusetti documented the first known interaction between a Thargoid Interceptor and Barnacles on Pleiades Sector OI-T C3-7 A 6 at coordinates -42.77, -21.70, confirming the two are related. The Unknown Ship approached one Barnacle, incapacitating any nearby ships and SRVs. The craft then rotated until its propulsion array faced and was aligned with the Barnacle, before drawing a pulsing beam of light or energy from it for a brief period. The Unknown Ship then departed as rapidly as it arrived. It is possible that Barnacles serve as refueling stations of some kind for Unknown Ships, and the Meta-Alloys they produce are fuel or repair materials for them, but this is currently only conjecture.^[4]^

It has been observed when a Thargoid Interceptor visits a Thargoid Barnacle site, the Barnacle releases a cloud of green "particles".^[5]^ The Interceptor deploys a shield with a similar appearance when it receives enough damage to The Thargoid ship may need to disable its shields before it can refuel/fire the green beam at the barnacles.^[5]^

### Barnacle Seeding

Ram Tah decrypted ancient Guardian logs that indicated Thargoid Barnacles were designed to extract resources from a planet and transform them into Meta-Alloys for use in the production of Thargoid ships and technologies. The Guardians surmised that for the Thargoids, seeding a planet with barnacles was an important process in preparing an area for occupation.^[1]^ The Thargoids' seeding of a region of space that was later developed by the Guardians became the basis for the Guardian-Thargoid War.

#### Barnacle Matrices

Following the escalation of the Second Thargoid War after the battle of HIP 22460 and the subsequent arrival of the Titans, Thargoid forces began invading the bubble in late 3308. By mid-3309 (after facing stiff opposition from human forces and the newly reformed Aegis), Thargoid forces began entrenching themselves in systems featuring Ammonia worlds. Over time, small clusters of barnacle like structures began appearing on these planets.

By late 3309, many of these 'Matrix sites' had grown into vast Thargoid production sites, known as Spires. The purpose and function of these growths have not yet been determined.

- The existence of Barnacles was first hinted at during a trailer for *Elite Dangerous: Horizons* released on December 15th 2015.^[8]^
