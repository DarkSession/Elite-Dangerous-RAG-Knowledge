**Founders World** is a terraformed Earth-like World in the permit-locked Shinrarta Dezhra system. It orbits the star Shinrarta Dezhra, and is orbited by the Orbis starport Jameson Memorial. The planet is home to the headquarters of the Pilots Federation, and is a common retirement destination for commanders who have achieved an Elite rank.

## Notes

- The system permit for Shinrarta Dezhra, "Founders World Permit", takes its name from Founders World.
- The planet's name is a reference to the *Elite Dangerous* "founders", or people who supported the Kickstarter campaign. All Kickstarter backers were granted a Founders World Permit as a reward, and thus had access to Shinrarta Dezhra from the start of the game without the need to achieve an Elite rank.
