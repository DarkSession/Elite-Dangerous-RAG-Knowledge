The **Narwhal Liner** is a ship manufactured by Saud Kruger. It is a variant of the Beluga Liner.

In 3296, two customised Narwhals were purchased by the Federation to serve in the capacity of Starship One, the Federal President's personal transport. On February 28, 3302, eight months after the Starship One Narwhal carrying President Jasmina Halsey was lost in a catastrophic mis-jump, the remaining Narwhal was retired due to President Zachary Hudson's administration concluding that a luxury passenger vessel could not effectively meet the safety needs of the president. It was replaced by two modified Farragut-Class Battle Cruisers.^[1]^
