## Locations

They are usually found in inhabited systems. NPCs may also be in Anarchy systems less frequently. Most NPCs are neutral and will attack when triggered. Fewer NPCs do not respond to attacks. NPCs can spawn around various signal sources or randomly in normal space. 

## NPC types

There are many NPC types, these includes:

### Advanced Tactical Response

    - *Main article: Advanced Tactical Response*

ATR only spawn if they detect a high-notoriety pilot. If detected, they will drop in and deploy the Stonewall Jammer to prevent SAV from intercepting them and the Reverberating Cascade to immediately damage the offender's shield. Destroying an ATR requires arduous effort. They communicate with audible voices.  

### Crew

    - *Main article: Crew*

You can hire NPC crew to pilot your ship-launched fighters.

### Criminal

These NPC types always incur bounties and can be detected with basic ship scans. NPCs that incur bounties in an anarchy system are not recognized by ship scans and require a Kill-Warrant Scanner. A criminal NPC can have a minimum of 100,000 credits and 600â€“700 thousand credits maximum. A kill-warrant scanner can increase a criminal's bounty by circa 200,000 credits.

### Pirate

    - *Main article: Pirate*

These criminal NPCs spawn around Hotspot, Distress Call etc. to seek valuable cargo. If you have cargo and don't surrender you will be attacked. They deploy a Hatch Breaker limpet to hack the Cargo Hatch and jettison the cargo. 

Pirates will interdict pilots when they approach them. While interdicted they will:

1. Threaten the pilot by broadcasting a threatening message to make them jettison cargo.
2. Attack the pilot if he does not jettison cargo.
3. Scan the pilot's ship to see if there is valuable cargo.
4. If no cargo is detected in the hold or just limpets then they will leave peacefully.
5. In an Assassination mission, they will attack a pilot without hesitation.

### System Authority Vessel

    - *Main article: System Authority Vessel*

These NPCs spawn around a Station, fleet carrier, Nav Beacon, etc.  These authority vessels patrol a star system, scan ships and attack if you have a bounty. System Authority Vessels have different names depending on the star system's allegiance.
