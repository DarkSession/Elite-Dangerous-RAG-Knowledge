### Brewer Corporation Trailblazer Fleet Upgraded

**The campaign to update Brewer Corporation’s Trailblazer fleet has concluded in the Minerva system**.

Thanks to the efforts of independent pilots ferrying shipments to Minerva, a total of 5 additional Trailblazer megaships will be placed in strategic locations on the fringes of the core systems, providing a hub of tradable materials and services for early colonies.

Brewer COO Mark Rennik remarked on the campaign’s success:

“*Once again, we have received widespread support and confirmation of our efforts, which is both humbling and inspiring. It is obvious that there is great appetite for breaching the latest frontier to establish new colonies, further expanding humanity’s sphere of influence in our section of the galaxy*.”

The Trailblazer megaships are expected to be deployed in the coming weeks.

Participants can now collect their rewards from the initiative.

### New Era of System Colonisation Hailed a Success

**The first wave of newly colonised star systems has been labelled a ‘remarkable success’ by observers from across the core systems.**

Harlow Nassry of the Federal Times wrote that “*the raw potential of these new ports and settlements has inspired migration, with a notable number of displaced refugees from Sol boarding colony ships to start fresh*.”

Colm Tornquist of the Imperial Herald noted the “*considerable opportunity offered by Brewer Corporation’s support system for independent system colonisation,” remarking that “these fledgling populations are potential candidates to accept the Empire’s benevolence*.”

Meanwhile, Irfan Karim of the Alliance Tribune suggested the “*commercial enterprise offered by these system architects is truly impressive. One wonders just how far this new frontier will expand, given the industrial potency of these trailblazing communities*.”

Brewer Corporation has released the official figures on the initial colonisation rush:

26,684 Claims have been made

13,165 Systems have been colonised

24,037 New starports and outposts have been built

14,216 Surface installations have been established

983,599,593 Units of cargo have been delivered to construction sites

### Trailblazer Fleet Deployed to Support Colonisation Initiatives

**The Trailblazer fleet announced by Brewer Corporation last month has been deployed to strategic locations on the edges of the core systems.**

Described as ‘colonisation support hubs,’ the Trailblazer fleet provides a bespoke trade market focused on colonisation materials and goods. The first wave of independent colonisation efforts has been described as ‘overwhelmingly popular’ by Brewer COO Mark Rennik.

The fledgling public arm of Brewer’s claim management service has been inundated with requests, and Rennik confirmed that the number of claims had proved challenging. “*The speed at which new systems have been settled and expanded is frankly astonishing*,” Rennik said in a recent interview, “*and I'm delighted that so many pioneers have taken full advantage of this opportunity*.”

The Trailblazer fleet has been deployed to the following star systems:

Trailblazer Dream - HIP 90578

Trailblazer Song - Orgen

Trailblazer Wish - Bletii

Trailblazer Star - 34 Omicron Cephei

Trailblazer Promise - Klikis

Trailblazer Faith - Ngobe

Trailblazer Echo has returned to the Minerva system.

### Brewer Corporation deploying to assist Lantern Light station

An unusual and turbulent situation has arisen for residents of the station Lantern Light in the Lalande 25224 system. The architect, CMDR Lavelain, commissioned the station nearby a neutron star. However, the station was inadvertently deployed deep within the star’s gravitational well. As a result, the station’s movement and rotational speeds far exceed safe limits – time should be taken for caution when attempting docking.

Brewer Corporation has received numerous requests for support from the station’s residents and is mobilising to correct the station’s violent and turbulent movement. The operation is currently undergoing careful planning to ensure the orbit is not destabilized further into catastrophe, and is expected to take several weeks to accomplish.
