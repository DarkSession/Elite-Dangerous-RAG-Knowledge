**Amundsen Terminal** is a Planetary Outpost in the Lagoon Sector NI-S b4-10 system on planet 1. It is part of the Colonia Connection Highway, particularly useful for travels between Sol and Colonia.

A distinctive green and orange nebula situated on the near rim of the Norma arm, approx. 4,500 LYs from Sol in the constellation Sagittarius. It is one of only two star-forming nebulae faintly visible to the naked eye from mid-northern latitudes on Earth. Herschel 36 is the primary star of the Lagoon Nebula. This hot O-type star emanates ultraviolet light, heating and ionizing gases on the surface of the nebula.

Due to its convenient location just on the other side of the Sagittarius-Gap, the Lagoon Nebula has been used as a waypoint for many explorers travelling towards the galactic core regions. It has also been used as a basecamp for several major community expeditions, including the Sagittarius-Carina Mission and the Distant Worlds Expedition.
