# Client
A **Client** represents the interests of a group of citizens of the Empire. Every Imperial Citizen has a right to representation by a Client. A block of Clients is represented by a Patron, who in turn have a proportional amount of influence over Senators based on how many Clients and citizens they represent. A Client can post a petition to their Patron on behalf of their citizens. A Patron has the right to transfer their support from one Senator to another if they feel the original Senator is not furthering their Clients' interests. If enough Clients back a Patron, that Patron can petition the Emperor to be appointed a Senator and replace another Senator with less backing.^[1]^
