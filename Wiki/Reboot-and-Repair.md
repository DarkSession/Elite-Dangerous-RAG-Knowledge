# Reboot and Repair
Reboot / Repair ship
 		 	 

**Reboot and Repair** is a function listed in the right UI panel that allows pilots to repair broken modules by cannibalizing healthy ones. The health taken from healthy modules is double the amount of health given to broken modules. Furthermore, the function will not work if no modules have less than 5% health or if there are no broken modules.

Reboot and Repair will also restore shields to 50% of their capacity after the process is complete, but only if you are moving at a speed of 49 m/s or less. This is useful in faster, well-shielded ships like the Imperial Courier where one can get away briefly to reboot, and with Prismatic Shields due to their slower broken regeneration rate. While riskier in PvP combat, it is an effective time-saver for high-shield ships in PvE situations, such as between targets during bounty-hunting.

Once the function has been activated, the ship will shut down, deactivating all modules in the process, including Shields, Thrusters, and Life Support.

## Notes

- The Reboot and Repair function was added with the Wings Update (1.2).
- Reboot and Repair cannot be used to repair a ship's canopy or hull. Repair Limpets should be used instead.
- Reboot and Repair cannot be accessed during Supercruise, only while in normal space.
