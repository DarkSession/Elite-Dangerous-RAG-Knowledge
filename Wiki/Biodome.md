A **Biodome** is an insulated dome-shaped structure with a closed ecological system (CES). The ecosystem doesn't require exchange of matter with the outside world. Biodomes provide a life-supporting habitat in inhospitable places.^[1]^ Such as for human colonies on planets, moons without breathable atmospheres as well as Megaships in space. A biodome can contain farms, forests and parks.
