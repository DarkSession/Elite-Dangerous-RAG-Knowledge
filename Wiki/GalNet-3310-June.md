### Repel Pirates and Provide Aid to De Caminha Station

**\*PILOTS FEDERATION ALERT\***

Reports are coming in that the strained De Caminha station has been the target of increased levels of pirate attacks.

Jerome Archer has announced a growing state of concern among parts of Federation space, stating that the war has spread supplies and support too thin amongst their territories.

Archer currently remains the Vice President of the Federation until President-elect Felicia Winters returns from supporting her home planet of Rhea 3, which is still recovering from a series of devastating earthquakes.

At an emergency conference, Jerome Archer stated the following:

“*The good work that the Federation is doing in the fight against the Thargoids is noble, and valuable, but it takes its toll. Our president, Zachary Hudson, has done an excellent job maintaining the Federation in spite of this, but we can only do so much*.”

“*It pains me to see De Caminha be the target of attacks by criminals looking to take advantage of the Federation’s continued efforts to end the war as quickly as possible, so I am calling on pilots across the galaxy for aid*.”

“*I urge you to hunt down the aggressors and supply the Earth Defence Fleet stationed in De Caminha with the medicines and equipment to prevent further attacks. Only by doing both will the station be safe again*.”

“*Any help is appreciated, and will be rewarded*.”

### Aegis Wary About Changing Thargoid Behaviour

A recent behavioural change in the Thargoids has prompted urgent discussion among Aegis researchers and strategists.

Since the fall of the fourth Titan, Hadad, there are increasing reports that the Thargoid expansion efforts have been growing weaker. While Thargoids are continuing to expand outwards from the Titans, they are no longer reinforcing their spire sites. Further, independent squadrons dedicated to defeating the Thargoid threat like SNPX, AXI, and MUDD, have noted increasing ease in thwarting attempts to probe and invade systems.

Dr. Ivano Colombera, Imperial Science Academy’s director of xenological studies and Empire liaison to Aegis, gave their view:

“*I have heard the strategy reports touting words like ‘weakening Thargoid presence’, and I must urge caution. I hypothesise that this change signals a strategic defensive response, not an enemy on their last legs*.”

“*I believe that the Thargoids are consolidating and planning, with the likely aim of reinforcing the final four Titans to prevent further losses. They may seem ‘weak’ now, yes, but everything we know of Thargoid behaviour suggests that this change shepherds something else. We are backing them into a corner, but that is when any creature is at its most unpredictable. And at its most dangerous*.”

Aegis has urged pilots across the galaxy to take this warning seriously and work to end the war before the Thargoids have time to retaliate. Humanity’s war effort is currently directed towards Titan Indra.

### De Caminha Station Has Been Successfully Reinforced

The pirates attacking De Caminha have been eliminated, and supplies have been provided to prevent further attacks.

Jerome Archer offered his thanks in an announcement this morning:

“*Time and time again, I am impressed by the skill and compassion of the galaxy’s pilots. Security for Federation citizens is my number one priority, and it pains me that a station in our space could be the target of opportunistic low lives, but through your efforts this station is once again secure and ready if those pirates return. Rewards are now available to those who helped in the defence efforts*.”

“*But I am compelled to raise the question on everyone’s mind: will this situation be better when Felicia Winters finally assumes office? A President-elect who, I remind you, seems uninterested in the security of her citizens. Who wants to shut down resources like the PDB, which has saved many, many lives already*.”

“*Is she a president capable of maintaining peace, when aggressors are increasingly appearing from all sides?*”

“*Or is she a president who puts her ideals before the lives of her people?*”

“*I once again urge congress to reconsider allowing Zachary Hudson another term as President of the Federation in light of Winters’ ongoing, conspicuous, absence*.”

### Achilles Aerospace facility targeted by malicious agents

The Alioth-based facility housing production of Achilles’ new Supercruise Overcharge capable Frame Shift Drives came under attack today.

The crime was perpetrated by a small group of individuals piloting a ship loaded with high-impact explosive weaponry, seemingly with the intention of sabotaging SCO drive production.

The group piloting the ship had posed as Achilles’ Aerospace engineers and had somehow gained high-level clearance to bring the vehicle deep into the facility. Achilles themselves are unsure how this could have been possible, stating to reporters that the malicious agents would have required “incredibly sophisticated technology” to forge the appropriate passes.

The group were able to bypass the facility’s first checkpoint before the automated security robots identified them as a potential threat. The malicious agents apparently opened fire on the facility, preventing the robots from attempting a peaceful resolution.

There were no survivors of the conflict, and none of the malicious agents were identifiable in any active database.

Achilles reports that they have increased security tenfold since the incident, and that this should be considered a testament to the quality of the security robots produced by their Robotics division.

Achilles also reassures consumers that the incident has had no impact on Supercruise Overcharge module manufacturing.
