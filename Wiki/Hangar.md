## Access

The hangar can be entered after a ship successfully docked. The commander connects with a service-link element of the station or settlement which shows the option *"Enter Hangar".* By selecting this option, the docking platform lowers to transfer the ship inside the hangar. To exit the hangar simply select "*Launch*". The station grants permission to exit and undock. The docking clamps are disabled and the ship is released. Large settlements have hangars for SRVs.

## Hangar types

The hangar type is determined by the location. For station hangars it depends on the star system's type, economy and population. The Fighter Hangar and Planetary Vehicle Hangar have only 1 type and are inaccessible on foot.

## Services

Some services are only available while your ship is inside a hangar. You can disembark inside the hangar to walk around to inspect the ship or towards to Express Lift which lead to the Concourse. The station, carrier or settlement will have specific services such as Universal Cartographics, Shipyard, Commodities Market, Mission Board, Contacts, Crew Lounge, local news and ship services. 

## Hangar modules

Ships can be outfitted with a P*lanetary Vehicle Hangar* for a Surface Recon Vehicle. There are multiple hangar sizes. Larger ones increase the number of vehicle bays. A Fighter Hangar is purchasable via Outfitting. It can construct and maintain Ship-Launched Fighters. These fighters can be launched via the role switch panel in the cockpit interface.
