A Crystalline Cluster
 		 	  

**Crystalline Clusters** are small, destructible deposits found at Geological Surface Signals that contain Raw Materials. The Materials obtained from Crystalline Clusters are dependent on the composition of the planet or moon on which they are found.

## Locations

Crystalline Clusters are found among Geological Surface Signals, such as Crystalline Shards or Ice Geysers, which can be detected from space using the Detailed Surface Scanner.
