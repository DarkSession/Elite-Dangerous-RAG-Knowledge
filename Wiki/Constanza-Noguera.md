Mayor of Azaladshu Free

**Constanza Noguera** is the Mayor of Azaladshu Free, an independent minor faction based in the Azaladshu system that was originally a member of the Federation. Noguera was elected in June 3307 on a wave of public discontent within the Federation that followed the passage of the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act and the implementation of the Proactive Detection Bureau. The Mayor promptly declared Azaladshu Free's independence from the Federation on June 29, 3307. The move not only meant the withdrawal of Azaladshu from the Federal Accord, but also the withdrawal of three other systems that were under the faction's control at the time: LFT 824, LHS 277, and LTT 3919. Federal Congress and President Zachary Hudson considered the withdrawal illegal because it was not approved by a referendum held among Azaladshu Free's constituents as required by Federal law.

Mayor Noguera's secession bid instigated a conflict in Azaladshu between her faction and the Federal loyalist faction Neche Inc from July 1, 3307, to July 8, 3307. Azaladshu Free achieved victory and secured its independence, which inspired the secession of three other like-minded factions and their systems: the Coalition of Uteran, which controlled Uteran and Ga'anjob'al; LP 726-6 Free, which controlled LP 726-6 and Aunochis; and Gluscap Labour, which controlled Gluscap and V902 Centauri. In the aftermath, more Federal factions considered following suit.

## Timeline

21 JUL 3307

- More Federal factions are considering declaring independence following the recent conflict in the Azaladshu system. Sofia Trevino, political journalist with The Federal Times, published an overview of the situation: "When Azaladshu Free seceded in reaction to the government's surveillance laws, it inspired three other factions to do the same, making ten systems and a billion people independent. Superpowers routinely gain and lose systems via local politics, but this was a rare instance of member factions abandoning their fealty. The newly sovereign nations have severed all links with the Proactive Detection Bureau, so their communications are no longer being monitored. Despite broad public support for the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, many citizens still consider personal privacy to be a constitutional right. Dozens of other factions are now considering independence. This affects only a small percentage of the systems under Federal control, but is highly embarrassing for President Hudson as well as Shadow President Winters â€“ her organised resistance to the surveillance laws is what inspired factions to secede. Advocacy, the civil rights organisation, claims that the Federal Intelligence Agency has begun arresting secessionist ringleaders under spurious charges. If true, it suggests that the government will go to any lengths to prevent a full-scale rebellion spreading throughout the Federation."^[1]^

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
The Azaladshu Free faction has defeated the forces of Neche Inc and retained independence from the Federation. As a result, the Azaladshu, LFT 824, LHS 277 and LTT 3919 systems have confirmed their independent status. The victory also inspired the Coalition of Uteran, LP 726-6 Free and Gluscap Labour factions to secede from the Federation, affecting all systems under their control. Mayor Constanza Noguera, leader of Azaladshu Free, declared: "A Federation that abuses the rights of its people has no authority. With the help of our loyal supporters, we've made a stand for dignity and civil rights." The situation has caused turmoil in Congress, with President Zachary Hudson being criticised for his inability to contain this rebellion. Shadow President Felicia Winters responded to accusations that she orchestrated the seceding factions: "I support their rejection of our harsh surveillance laws, but not their methods of protest. I have no wish to see the Federation lose member systems for any reason." Pilots who supported the Azaladshu Free faction can collect their rewards at Eratosthenes Ring station.^[2]^

01 JUL 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Conflict has erupted between the Azaladshu Free and Neche Inc factions, as multiple Federal systems declare independence. This was sparked by Azaladshu Free withdrawing from the Federation, which transformed Azaladshu, LFT 824, LHS 277 and LTT 3919 into independent systems. The faction strenuously opposes government monitoring of Federal citizens' private communications. Three other Federal factions are on the verge of declaring independence: Coalition of Uteran, Lp 726-6 Free and Gluscap Labour. All are closely monitoring the situation in Azaladshu and considering their next move. Mayor Constanza Noguera, leader of Azaladshu Free, made this statement: "We refuse to accept the Federation's draconian surveillance laws. I call upon all supporters of independence to help us fight for our sovereignty!" The declaration brought a swift reaction from President Zachary Hudson: "As Azaladshu Free has violated the Federal Accord, I have no option but to order Neche Inc to engage with these criminals. Thanks to advance intelligence on the secession, we were able to establish the megaship Fortress Liberty in the system to help retake it for the Federation." In Congress, Shadow President Felicia Winters faced criticism for allowing the secession to occur within her sphere of influence. She reiterated that she does not support rebellion, but does consider the Proactive Detection Bureau to be unconstitutional.^[3]^

29 JUN 3307

- The Azaladshu Free faction, which controls four systems, has seceded from the Federation in protest against civilian surveillance. The unexpected declaration followed the election of new leadership for Azaladshu Free, which currently controls the Azaladshu, LFT 824, LHS 277 and LTT 3919 systems. Mayor Constanza Noguera announced: "The Federation has become corrupt, authoritarian and untrustworthy. In particular, the public surveillance laws to spy on innocent people cannot be tolerated. From now on, we will govern our systems as independent sovereign nations." Political observers believe that several other Federal factions are also planning to declare independence. All are within Shadow President Felicia Winters's sphere of influence, although she has publicly renounced any support of these actions. Congress has stated that secession is illegal under the Federal Accord, and ordered Azaladshu Free to revert to normal membership status. The Federal Navy and other military organisations have been placed on alert. President Hudson has reacted strongly, stating that "This degree of organised criminal behaviour only proves that the Proactive Detection Bureau is needed to maintain order." Shadow President Winters countered by claiming "Removing our citizens' right to privacy is the cause of this rebellion, not the solution."^[4]^
