## Notes

- Players who start a new game in *Elite Dangerous*, own *Elite Dangerous: Horizons*, and do not choose to begin pilot training in Dromi will first spawn at Baker's Prospect in Asellus Primus. The loan Sidewinder MkI they begin with will have a Planetary Vehicle Hangar equipped and loaded with a Scarab SRV.
