**Core Enterprises** is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Core Dynamics based in HIP 54530. It was created in June 3307 to absorb the assets of Jupiter Division, a rogue corporatist faction that absconded with a significant portion of Core Dynamics' assets in February 3307 and was ultimately subjugated with the help of the Silver Legal Group minor faction and independent pilots. Core Enterprises also controls Jupiter Division's former megaship, Victory's Forge, which is stationed in Ts'ao Tach.

## Timeline

21 JUN 3307

- The fall of Jupiter Division has undermined the popular movement calling for the Federation to be governed by corporations. Conrad Sterling, political journalist for Vox Galactica, reported on developments: "Core Dynamics's recent victory in the Ts'ao Tach system dealt a severe blow to the corporatists. Many companies withdrew their support even before the last shot was fired, and plans for Jupiter Division to become the movement's central organisation have been abandoned. Sighs of relief were undoubtedly breathed through the corridors of power on Mars when this threat to the Federation's democratic principles was defeated. And yet, despite Congress downplaying it and many Federal newsfeeds neglecting to cover the story, calls for a corporatocracy have not been completely silenced. Citizens who seek an alternative to voting for either Hudson or Winters are still attracted to the idea. Would corporate rule be more honest? Opinions vary, but many supporters claim 'big business' already possesses true power behind closed doors. It now seems that history will record this as a path not taken. With Jupiter Rochester imprisoned and Jupiter Division dissolved, replacement figureheads for the corporatist movement are unlikely to arise in time to preserve it."^[1]^

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
The corporate faction Jupiter Division has been defeated by the Silver Legal Group in the Ts'ao Tach system. The breakaway faction from Core Dynamics was unable to resist efforts by its parent company to recover ships and resources. Jupiter Division will soon be subsumed by Core Enterprises, a subsidiary of Core Dynamics. Owen McKenna, the CEO of Core Dynamics, declared: "Thanks to the Silver Legal Group and other loyal allies of the Federation, we have finally crushed this criminal enterprise. Let this be an end to the delusions of Jupiter Rochester." Many newsfeeds believe that Jupiter Division's defeat will have a negative impact on the corporatist movement that has recently emerged within some Federal systems. Director Theodore Sullivan of the Silver Legal Group confirmed that those who fought on their side can now collect payments from the Iron Wings of Justice megaship in the Ts'ao Tach system.^[2]^
