# Orbital Cruise
Orbital Cruise HUD adds artificial horizon, altimeter, vertical speed indicator and coordinates
 		 	 

**Orbital Cruise** is a speed less than Supercruise but faster than Normal Speed. it is the initial stage of Planetary Landings. As pilots approach a planet in Supercruise, they will drop into Orbital Cruise. This will allow the player to fly around the planet at a speed suited to covering vast distances and locate Points of Interest or other suitable landing zones. To maximize their speed in Orbital Cruise, a pilot should keep their pitch angle in the blue zone between -5 to +5 degrees.

Transition between Orbital Cruise and Normal Speed is done through Gliding, if the appropriate speed and angle of approach are achieved. The lowest altitude at which Orbital Cruise is possible is 25 kilometers. Note that when leaving the planet, Orbital Cruise can be initiated at altitudes below 25 km, but pitching the ship below the horizon while under the minimum altitude will result in an immediate drop into normal space.

## Notes

- Orbital Cruise was added in *Elite Dangerous: Horizons* version 2.0.
