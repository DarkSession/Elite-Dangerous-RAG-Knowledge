## Biography

Before meeting Meredith Argent in 3228, Mic Turner was a talented pilot and explorer with a passion for long-distance flight. He graduated with honours from the civilian Pilots Federation school on his homeworld of Jones Colony in the Essafa system. In 3224, he led a Federal expedition to colonise the Olgrea system. He then moved to New California in Alioth just before a revolt against corporate authority broke out. Turner's piloting skills earned him a leading role among the revolutionaries, as he was able to secure Alioth's gas mining platforms and help the fighters weather retaliatory strikes from responding Federal and Imperial military forces. It was at the gas platform where Turner was stationed that he encountered the scientist and Caker cell leader Meredith Argent, forging a partnership that lasted for the rest of their lives.^[1]^^[2]^^[3]^

When the Federation and Empire withdrew their forces from Alioth, Turner and Argent seized the opportunity to establish a new political system for people who sought an alternative to the two reigning superpowers of the galaxy. In 3230, the Alliance of Independent Systems was born, and became a superpower in its own right over the following decades. In honour of Mic Turner's role in the liberation of Alioth and the creation of the Alliance, the planet Gordonworld was renamed Turner's World.^[3]^ Turner returned to Olgrea in 3239 at the head of an Alliance fleet to wrest the system from Federal control.^[2]^

As the Alliance expanded, Argent and Turner turned to business ventures and founded the aerospace company Argent Aerodynamics Amalgamated Inc (AAAI), based out of New Rossyth Shipyards on Turner's World. The company debuted its first ships in 3237, and by 3252, it was working on the Quest-class long-range exploration ship, which was intended for use in an expedition to locate the mysterious Thargoids. Turner piloted a prototype named *Turner's Quest* for test flights in Pleione in the Pleiades Nebula, but was never seen again after jumping out of the system. Argent held a memorial service for Turner the following year.^[3]^

In the 34th century, the Engineer Bill Turner publicly claimed to be Mic Turner's son, but this could not be proven. The Alliance was wary of Bill using the name of one of its co-founders, but tolerated his presence in Alioth.^[4]^

## Timeline

03 AUG 3305

- The Leesti system played host to the second week of the Alliance Festival of Culture, where a new film production has caused minor controversy. The Alliance Tribune's cultural correspondent Corinne Macintyre offered these details: "A grand celebration of cinematic art took place at George Lucas station, featuring a wide range of traditional and interactive media from dozens of systems. The talking point was undoubtedly 'Unity', a historical drama from award-winning director Hal Raskin. It portrays Alliance founders Mic Turner and Meredith Argent as rivals who faked their romance to rally political support. More traditionalist audiences – and not a few critics – took issue with the suggestion that the couple's love was fraudulent, while others applauded it as bold and challenging. But this lively debate did nothing to dampen spirits at the event, which drew appreciative crowds." The Alliance Festival of Culture is scheduled to continue over the next five weeks.^[5]^
