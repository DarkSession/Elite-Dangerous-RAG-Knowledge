> Etienne Dorn used to be the lead shield engineer for Kraken Shield Specialists, but these days he’s mostly self employed. He still shares his developments with his former employers, but he usually offers products to private clients first...for the right price. His burgeoning success has led him to develop state-of-the-art facilities, but he prefers to work with robots to maintain his seclusion.
