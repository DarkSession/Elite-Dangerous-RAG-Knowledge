## History

Defence industry veteran Kinematic Armaments is the galaxy's largest producer of ballistic weaponry.^[2]^ Founded in 3240, the company maximises output while minimising production costs, using a business model seen as monopolistic by some critics. Yet their firearms remain wildly popular and are often used by security forces across colonised space.
