**Wreaken Corporation**, also known as **Wreaken Construction and Mining (WCM)**, is an independent mega corporation with extensive operations throughout independent, Federal, and Allied space. It is the main rival of Mastopolos Mining which has a major presence in Imperial systems. Founded sometime in the 23rd century by Tobias Wreaken, Wreaken Corporation became one of the first interstellar corporations and was a ubiquitous sight in most of the Federation's early colonies. Wreaken's reputation for prioritising employee safety over profits still endures centuries later.

Tobias Wreaken, an Earth-born coal miner, founded Wreaken Corporation in the 23rd century, in the days when mining still required manual labour and could not be completely automated. Wreaken mandated a corporate culture that prioritised employee safety, an approach that remained strongly ingrained in Wreaken Corporation generation after generation. Combined with a substantial mining expertise, this made the company a popular, reliable choice as a contractor for extracting resources from asteroids, airless moons, and hazardous planets across the frontiers of early interstellar civilisation. Almost all of the Federation's early colonial missions carried a Wreaken representative and Wreaken equipment. Consequently, as the Federation grew, so did Wreaken Corporation, and it eventually joined the ranks of the galaxy's mega corporations.^[1]^^[2]^

### Modern operations

In the 34th century, Wreaken Corporation employs over a quarter of a million full-time staff, owns sole mineral rights to 49 planets, and holds contracts with many Federal, independent, and Allied systems.^[2]^^[3]^ Wreaken mining facilities extract vast amounts of natural resources, which are then either refined on-site or transported to industrial refineries depending on the size of the deposit.^[3]^ Sale of refined alloys generates a significant part of Wreaken's revenue.^[4]^

Wreaken specialises in the extraction of tantalum, a vital component in the manufacture of Frame Shift Drives. One of the corporation's main tantalum sources is the Tiliala system; while other mining corporations have been unable to exploit Tiliala's tantalum due to ongoing legal disputes between the Federation and Empire over jurisdiction, Wreaken holds contracts with both superpowers and can operate its extraction facilities without interruption. However, determining how to sell the ore impartially is a recurring issue.^[3]^ Tensions with Mastopolos Mining have also escalated over the latter's suspected tactic of seeding planets with false tantalum deposits, which has caused Wreaken to waste time and resources conducting detailed surveys on prospects that were ultimately found to be barren.^[1]^

Wreaken is a major customer of Sirius Mining. The two businesses signed a long-term deal for Wreaken to have exclusive access to Sirius Mining equipment.^[4]^ Wreaken's ongoing rivalry with Mastopolos Mining, its largest competitor, compels it to keep an aggressive pace of expansion and acquisition.^[3]^

## Subsidiaries

### Wreaken Construction

Wreaken Construction, based in the Ega system, is a subsidiary of Wreaken Corporation that specialises in construction work. A member of The Club known only as "Finance" is known to manage much of Wreaken Construction's activities.^[5]^ Wreaken Construction's CEO is Emmerich Koenig.^[6]^

In November 3302, Wreaken Construction assembled a large, well-defended convoy of heavy construction ships in the Zearla system. Wreaken made no effort to publicise the convoy or clarify its purpose, and curious onlookers who approached too closely were met with warning shots. It was speculated that the convoy was somehow related to Senator Denton Patreus's recent statements indicating that the Empire would ignore the London Treaty and manufacture additional Majestic-Class Interdictors.^[7]^ The convoy eventually entered the permit-locked Col 70 Sector and began work on an unknown project under heavy guard. On January 27, 3303, an unidentified individual was reported dead from radiation exposure at a Wreaken Construction site in the Col 70 Sector. A Wreaken representative claimed the decedent was a trespasser who breached the facility and died in an industrial accident.^[8]^

In August 3307, Wreaken Construction entered LTT 198 on the heels of Torval-Mastopolos Mining, a new independent branch of Mastopolos Mining controlled by Senator Zemina Torval, which sought to establish itself in the permit-locked system. Both companies allegedly purchased access to the system from LTT 198 State Ltd for an exorbitant fee and built local headquarters facilities on the planet Dini. Wreaken Construction also stationed the Megaship Tobias's Gift above moon 5 d. Commentators speculated that Wreaken Construction wanted a presence in LTT 198 mainly to crush Torval-Mastopolos Mining before it could flourish since it was a branch of its old rival.^[9]^ On August 19, both corporations launched competing mining campaigns. The winner would be permitted to remain in LTT 198 and build a new starport. Hoping to draw more support for Wreaken's campaign, CEO Koenig offered to reward participants with a specially-engineered Abrasion Blaster.^[6]^ Unfortunately for Koenig, his campaign lost to his rival's on August 26, and Wreaken Construction was forced to withdraw from the system.^[10]^^[11]^

### Wreaken Defence Force

The Wreaken Defence Force is the private fleet of Wreaken Corporation. The fleet consists primarily of Federal Corvettes and smaller ships, which are used to protect Wreaken facilities and installations. In the event that a Wreaken facility faces an extreme threat, the corporation can call on a battlefleet from the Sirius Navy for assistance under the terms of their commercial relationship. While this security service comes at cost, it is less expensive than if Wreaken were to operate its own cruisers.^[4]^
