## Features

- **New "In Ship" Starter Experience**
    - When starting a new game, players are given essential pilot training by Pilots Federation instructor Theo Arcosta. Lessons include:
        - Basic flight controls and scanning.
        - Supercruise and navigation.
        - A combat exercise around a Megaship.
        - Completing a hyperspace jump and docking at a Starport.
    - These new training missions feature VO across all languages supported by *Elite Dangerous*.
    - Veteran Commanders can experience the new training missions at any time by accessing the training section of the right HUD panel.

- **Improved Livery System and Store**
    - Options to preview cosmetic items before purchase are expanded to include multiple camera angles. Items can also be previewed for ships which the player does not currently own.
    - Players can purchase individual cosmetic items from bundles without needing to purchase the entire bundle.
    - Ship Livery can be changed from the game's main menu at any time without the need to be docked at a station with Outfitting and Livery services.
    - Purchasing Livery and Holo-Me items is now done through the game itself, rather than having to access an external website.^[4]^

- **ARX Currency**
    - Frontier Points, previously used by Xbox One and PlayStation 4 players to purchase cosmetics in the Frontier Store, are rebranded as ARX, and expanded to include PC players, unifying the cosmetic system across all platforms. ARX can be redeemed on all Livery and Commander Customisation items, and can either be purchased outside the game, or earned in-game at a rate of up to 400 ARX per week.^[6]^
