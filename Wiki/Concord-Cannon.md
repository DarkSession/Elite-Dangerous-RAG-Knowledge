## Usage

The Concord Cannon is available only as a Class 2 gimballed hardpoint. Much like standard cannons, the Concord Cannon is a highly specialized weapon that is best suited for targeted module damage over general hull damage due to its high armour piercing value and hull breach chance. However, the Concord Cannon differs from standard cannons in that it trades damage per shot, armour piercing, and hull breach damage for shot speed and overall DPS.

The main drawback of the Concord Cannon is that since it is exclusively a gimballed hardpoint, it is easily countered by Chaff Launchers.
