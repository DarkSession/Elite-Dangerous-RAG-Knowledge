## Timeline

30 SEP 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Enormous amounts of data on Earth-like worlds has been collected for a campaign by shipbuilding firm Saud Kruger. The data is highly valuable to the corporation's subsidiary, Astrogator Tours, which runs holiday cruises across the galaxy and is seeking new locations. The initiative was declared a success by CEO Stanislav Kruger: "Not only have we received data about highly promising systems, but many creative Commanders provided imagery guaranteed to entice adventure-seekers to these new worlds. We are deeply grateful to all pilots who took part." Vistaenis Incorporated, Saud Kruger's partner in this initiative, is now offering payment for the exploration data at Youll Port in the Vistaenis system. Tourist beacons will be added to the most suitable systems by Thursday the 28th of October, which will record for posterity the names of the pilots who submitted the most compelling images. As a result of the initiative, a discount of 15% will be applied to sales of all Dolphin, Orca and Beluga Liner ships from the 1st of October, alongside a reduction in cost for the luxury-class cabins which can be installed in any of Saud Kruger's vessels.^[2]^

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
An initiative to gather data on potential tourist destinations has been launched by shipbuilding corporation Saud Kruger. The luxury passenger ship manufacturer aims to identify new Earth-like planets that would be attractive to holidaymakers. These trips will be managed by its subsidiary, Astrogator Tours. CEO Stanislav Kruger announced the campaign to the press: "We are keen to acquire data on Earth-like worlds, to assess their suitability as destinations for future holidaymakers seeking the adventure of a lifetime. However, all exploration data is valuable and will earn generous payments. In addition, our marketing department is keen to receive images of eye-catching sights found within unpopulated systems containing Earth-like worlds, to spot the most potentially exciting additions to the Astrogator Tours catalogue." Vistaenis Incorporated has agreed to organise the initiative on behalf of Saud Kruger. Contributing pilots are invited to deliver exploration data to Youll Port in the Vistaenis system. They can also submit their most compelling images by Thursday the 30th of September. By Thursday the 28th of October, the most suitable locations will receive tourist beacons and credit the Commander for their submission where appropriate. If successful, Saud Kruger's Dolphin, Orca and Beluga Liner ships will be reduced in price for one week from Friday the 1st of October, with the percentage dependent on the volume of data received. There will also be a discount on the luxury-class cabins used by these crafts to transport VIP passengers.^[3]^
