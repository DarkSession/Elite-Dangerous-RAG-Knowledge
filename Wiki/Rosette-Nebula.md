Rosette Nebula and a planet
 		 	 

The **Rosette Nebula** is a large spherical H II region, three times larger than the Orion Nebula. It's 5000 light years from Sol. The nebula was first discovered piecemeal and thus catalogued in pieces (NGC 2237, NGC 2238, and NGC 2246) in the 19th century. Stars are believed to be forming in the central cluster (NGC 2237).^[1]^

The Asteroid Base New Beginning is in Rosette Sector CQ-Y d59. It has a monopoly control by the New Dawn Commune.
