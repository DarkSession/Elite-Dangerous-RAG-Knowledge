# Data point
**Data points** are interactive objects found in settlements and points of interest. A Data Link Scanner can be used to interact with them.

Scanning data points gives Data Point Intel Packages which can be redeemed with a specific Major Faction for Credits, and also Encoded Materials which are used for Engineering.

Data points can be part of a set of data points, where you have to scan the whole set before being given the package. Scanning a data point activates a timer until the scanned status of the set resets. This timer is topped up each time you successfully scan a data point. There are usually four data points as part of a set.
