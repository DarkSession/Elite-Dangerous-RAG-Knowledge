**NGC 5979** is a planetary nebula in Hawking's Gap. It is a little over half of a light year across, located in the southern constellation of Triangulum Australe (the Southern Triangle). On the third planet in the CSI-61-15434 system, the unique mix of the colors from the dying star and the nebula combine to give the nightside that magical greenish-yellow purple color.
