> 
> Hera Tani's talent with power-management systems was evident from an early age. She grew up with the Jet Rats gang, keeping in close communication with them at all times, but she will also help those who are friendly with the gang. In turn they have responded to her talents by assigning anyone with sufficient technical ability to work and learn from her. Since their demise she has found favour with a mysterious imperial benefactor. She can put you in contact with another engineer if you develop your relationship with her.
