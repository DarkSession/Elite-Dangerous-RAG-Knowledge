# Sol/Io
IO in 3303
 		 	 

**Io** is Jupiter's innermost moon. It's one of the hottest worlds in Sol. Due to incredible tidal forces exerted by Jupiter, Io has a sub-surface ocean of magma and constant volcanic eruptions. There's lava fountains up to 400 kilometers high. The surface has rifts with active lava flows and it changes every thousands of years. The daily tides cause the crust to rise and fall by hundreds of feet.
