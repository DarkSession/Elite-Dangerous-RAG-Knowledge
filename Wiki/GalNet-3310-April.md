### Titan Oya deploys a surprise fleet of Orthrus vessels

The Titan known as Oya appears to have deployed a large fleet of Orthrus vessels into star systems farther from their own territory breaking expected behaviour.

Analysts noted that the locations in which Orthrus vessels have been tracked didn’t appear to have any particular importance, instead suggesting that this may be a new tactic or possibly a simple panic response to the mounting pressure on its fleet.

Titan Oya has been steadily losing territory to large numbers of AX-equipped human forces. These forces, spearheaded by coalitions known as ‘AXI’ and ‘XSF’ have been reclaiming ground from the Titans successfully for some time and were pivotal in the recent successful campaigns against the now-destroyed Titans, Taranis and Leigong.

The Pilots’ Federation have issued an alert to all independent pilots for each of the star systems where Orthrus vessels have been detected:

“*If Oya can be prevented from reclaiming territory, then it’s likely that this third Titan will fall within mere weeks. We encourage all pilots to track and eliminate any Orthrus vessels found patrolling these star systems before the Thargoids can move their assault forces into these footholds*.”

### Prototype Frame Shift Drive almost production ready, competitor sceptical

Material gathered from the Titan Taranis wreckage has reportedly allowed Achilles Aerospace to complete the research on their prototype Frame Shift Drive.

The recent initiative sponsored by Achilles Aerospace saw over 5000 independent pilots enter the hazardous wreckage of Titan Taranis, retrieving enough Titan Drive Components to allow Achilles to allegedly design a new type of Frame Shift Drive based on Titan technology.

A spokesperson for Achilles Aerospace gave the following update:

The Achilles Corporation would like to commend every brave pilot that responded to our request. The data we are gathering from the collected materials is staggering, and our work has progressed at an astonishing rate. Our teams are hard at work getting the prototype ready for production as I speak, and we are eager to show you all the fruits of our labour very soon.

Sirius Corporation, the current sole manufacturer of Frame Shift Drives, was asked for comment on this research:

“*Sirius recognises Achilles’ claims of ‘revolutionising’ an extremely advanced technology in a relatively short span of time, but we remain unconvinced of their substance. If Achilles can produce something other than words we will be happy to comment further*.”

### New Supercruise Overcharge module enters the market, a “turning point for humanity”

Achilles Aerospace have begun mass distribution of their own Frame Shift Drive modules, capable of what their marketing is calling an ‘Overcharged’ Supercruise.

This news follows the corporation urging pilots to gather Titan Drive Components from the dangerous remnants of destroyed Titans. The data gathered from the components seems to have been the catalyst to finalise what were previously only theoretical designs.

The new modules are capable of incredible speeds, much like the Titans themselves. The power of this new Frame Shift Drive does, however, put immense pressure on a ship when used.

In a speech at the private launch event for the module, held at Achilles headquarters, Achilles Aerospace chairman Maxine Patro said:

“*As of right now, our new modules have been distributed across the galaxy, and we fully expect that this will not only be a turning point in history for Achilles, but for the whole of humanity. We have truly revolutionised supercruise and, with this leap, we take another step out from under the Thargoids’ technological shadow. Thank you, Achilles engineers*.”

### The Assault on Oya

**\*Pilots’ Federation Alert\***

Titan Oya is under siege. This is an urgent call to all independent pilots to aid in the complete defeat of the third Titan.

The key modules for the assault continue to be readily available at all Rescue Megaships:

- Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser – To break through the maelstrom defence wave.

- Caustic Sink Launchers – To protect your ship from caustic effects of the maelstrom.

- Guardian Nanite Torpedo Pylon – To hamper the Titan’s vents and make it vulnerable to damage.

Rewards have been requisitioned for all Commanders able to participate in ending the Titan threat.

Good luck, Commanders.

### Anti-Guardian field project yields breakthrough - New modifications available

**\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\***

The engineer Ram Tah has discovered a method of immunising existing Guardian modules against the effects of anti-Guardian fields.

Earlier this year, Ram Tah discovered that certain Guardian relics revealed and activated nanite clusters when exposed to specific electromagnetic frequencies. These nanites proved disruptive to Thargoid technology on a molecular level and, importantly, were entirely unaffected by anti-Guardian fields unlike other Guardian technology.

In an urgent press conference, Aegis leadership announced a breakthrough in researching that latter quality.

The following statement was given by Professor Alba Tesreau:

“*Our knowledge of the Thargoids’ ancient adversary, the Guardians, is still so very limited, and yet Guardian technology has once again paved a way forward for humanity*.”

“*We urge pilots to use the modifications we are producing to utilise any powerful Guardian modules in their possession. Use them to push back against the Thargoid threat. Use them to win this war*.”

Aegis went on to announce that the modifications can now be made at Ram Tah’s workshop in the Meene system.

### Thargoid War Bulletin: Oya Successfully Attacked

Titan Oya in the Cephei Sector BV-Y B4 system has been confirmed as destroyed by Aegis, leaving five still operational.

Aden Tanner, Aegis’s lead anti-xeno strategist, delivered a cautionary statement:

“*I must remind all Commanders that these missions are highly dangerous and cannot be undertaken lightly. Entering a Maelstrom and flying close to a Titan requires your ship to be outfitted with caustic sink launchers and Thargoid pulse neutralisers. AX weaponry will also prove useful, as will Guardian nanite torpedoes to target the Titans’ thermal vents*.”

“*Be warned that your combat skills will be tested. Counter-attacks by Thargoid vessels become more frequent as the Titans take damage , and the mothership’s own turrets are deployed more aggressively. I would like to see veteran anti-xeno pilots passing on their knowledge to less-experienced pilots, to prevent unnecessary risks*.”
