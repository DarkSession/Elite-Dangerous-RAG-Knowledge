In May 3307, following Nova Imperium's defeat of the League of Mandu, a Federal faction that invaded Paresa to hold Nova Imperium responsible for the actions of the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army, Carlisle issued a statement admonishing the League of Mandu for its rashness and informing the public that they would withdraw from Paresa.

## Timeline

13 MAY 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
The conflict in the Paresa system has ended with Nova Imperium defeating the Federal-backed League of Mandu faction. Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval had been targeted following accusations that he controlled the NMLA paramilitary group. He delivered a public address: "Our hard-earned victory brings great honour to all who fought against the Federation's invasion. Their arrogance justifies our long-held belief that the Empire must stand apart from other superpowers, but Nova Imperium will continue to serve in the fight against terrorism. Memento Mordanticus!" Ambassador Catherine Carlisle of the Federal Diplomatic Corps made this statement: "Although we are grateful for their zeal in combatting the NMLA, our intermediaries at the League of Mandu have acted hastily and will soon depart from Imperial space." Pilots who fought for Nova Imperium can now collect their rewards from Dyson City in the Paresa system. Pilots who fought for the League of Mandu can now collect their rewards from Harmony's Shield in the Paresa system.^[1]^
