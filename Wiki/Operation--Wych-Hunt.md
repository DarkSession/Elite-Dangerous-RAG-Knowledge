## Background

On 30th May 3308, logs were found in the DG Canum Venaticorum system. Linking Salvation to the development of the Mycoid Bioweapon, Project Seraph as well as the sabotage and destruction of the Alexandria with all hands onboard.^[1]^ Subsequently trust in Salvation dwindled.

On 20th June 3308, Taurus Mining Ventures, Salvation's partner organisation was announced to be a modern incarnation of Azimuth Biochemicals. The associated minor faction changed its name to Azimuth Biotech, confirming the suspicions of the DG Canum Venaticorum logs.^[2]^ In response to this, the superpowers reasserted their support for Salvation. One journalist commented it this way:

> The reality is that the momentum of Salvation’s campaign is now too strong to be diverted. As is often the case during wartime, legality and morality have been set aside to focus on achieving victory.

No longer wanting to tolerate the crimes committed by Salvation and the apparent lack of agency from any of the superpowers, CMDR Psykit and CMDR Selene Stardragon formed a coalition of independent commanders, named Operation: Wych Hunt. This is related to evidence suggesting that the real name of Salvation is Dr. Caleb Wycherley, also called "The Witch" by several sources. The goal was to oppose the now renamed Azimuth Biotech minor faction with a series of coordinated strikes.
