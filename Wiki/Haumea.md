**Haumea** is a dwarf planet and Trans-Neptunian Object (it orbits the Sun beyond the orbit of Neptune) in the Sol system. It was discovered in 2005 by astronomers Michael E. Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz of the United States, and J. L. Ortiz of Spain. Haumea spins very quickly about its axis, meaning it has a very short day (it rotates once every 4 hours). As a result, the real-life Haumea is shaped like a triaxial ellipsoid, but the in-game version is spheroidal. So far, the real Haumea is the only Trans-Neptunian Object known to have a ring system (not included in-game).^[1]^

Real-life Haumea forms part of a family of collisional objects that are believed to have formed after an ancestral body was shattered in an impact early in the Solar System's history. The resulting fragments eventually formed into Haumea, its moons Hi'iaka and Namaka, and several smaller Kuiper Belt Objects.^[2]^ 

Although Haumea's moon Hi'iaka is included in the game, its other moon, Namaka, and the other members of the collisional family are not.

Haumea is named after the Hawaiian goddess of fertility and childbirth. Hi'iaka and Namaka are her daughters, respectively the goddesses of dance and of the sea.
