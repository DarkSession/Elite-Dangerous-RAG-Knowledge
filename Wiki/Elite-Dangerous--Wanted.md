**Elite Dangerous: Wanted** is a novel written by Gavin Deas (the shared pseudonym of Stephen Deas and Gavin Smith) about pirates and bounty hunters set in the world of the bestselling computer game *Elite*. It launched to tie in with *Elite Dangerous*. It is one of three distinct, but subtly linked novels written by major authors who are fans of the game.^[1]^ 

## Storyline

*When a routine bit of piracy goes wrong, the crew of the Song of Stone realise that there's a bounty hunter on their tail. One who might, finally, be able to outclass them. The Dragon Queen is feared across space, and for good reason. But even the bounty hunter doesn't realise what she's been hired to do. Or what is in the container she's been sent to retrieve.^[1]^*

*And she's not the only hunter in the game...^[1]^*

*Gavin Deas is the pseudonym used by Stephen Deas and Gavin Smith when writing together.*^[1]^
