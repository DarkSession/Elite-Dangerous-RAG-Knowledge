## History

HIP 22550 was one of eight systems selected by Sirius Corporation as sites for a series of new colonies for Marlinist refugees who had fled the Empire for the Federation in late 3306 to escape political persecution. Construction of the Marlinist Colonies began on December 17, 3306, and was completed by January 14, 3307.^[1]^^[2]^^[3]^ Over 800 million Marlinists were relocated to the new settlements by humanitarian aid organisation Safeguard Interstellar.^[4]^ Of the eight systems, since HIP 22550 gained the largest population of the refugees, 400 million, and was also only one of two systems with a starport, it became the de facto capital of the new government of the Marlinist Colonies.

As the Marlinist factions began democratic elections to determine their leaders on January 14, the Marlinists' transitional parliament declared a state of emergency due to a shortage of food stocks in their new homes. Community leader Dr. Jenna Fairfax issued a request for deliveries of food commodities to Stillman Hub in HIP 22550 to build a stockpile that would feed the Marlinists until they could become self-sufficient. The size of the stockpile would determine the scale of the discounts that the Marlinist Colonies could offer on locally-produced commodities, with larger discounts translating to faster development of trade routes with neighboring systems. Furthermore, as the Marlinist Colonies had yet to form system defence forces, the Free Marlinists of Carinae faction, then the controlling faction of HIP 22550, issued bounties on all criminal and anti-Marlinist ships in the area.^[3]^ On January 21, Fairfax was elected to the office of First Minister of the new Marlinist Parliament. In light of the aid campaign's success, she promptly distributed rewards to participants and enacted a 20% discount on commodities for a two-week period ending on February 5, 3307.^[5]^

Stillman Hub in HIP 22550 and Tilman Point in Hyades Sector RO-P b6-6 were bombed by the NMLA on July 29, 3307. The attacks were retaliation for the citizens of the Marlinist Colonies recently voting to elect Kayode Tau, who opposed the NMLA, to the post of prime consul of the Marlinist Consulate over Verity Dexter, who had pledged to provide a voice for the Neo-Marlinist fringe and was endorsed by Senator Lorcan Scordato. According to senior NMLA member Theta Seven, Dexter's rejection by Marlinist voters amounted to a betrayal. Over 35,000 civilians were killed in the bombings, including First Minister Jenna Fairfax.^[6]^^[7]^

On December 16, 3307, the Marlinist Colonies negotiated the reclamation of the Steel Majesty megaship, previously used as a hub by Neo-Marlinists, from the Empire, which had captured it following the second defeat of the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid. The vessel was jumped from Mudhrid to HIP 22550, where it was turned over to the control of the Free Marlinists of Carinane and renamed Fairfax Vision in memory of the late First Minister Fairfax. Her successor, First Minister Octavia Volkov, proclaimed that the Fairfax Vision would represent the Marlinist Colonies' diplomatic interests abroad.^[8]^

HIP 22550 was renamed to Concordia on June 8, 3308. All of the other seven original Marlinist Colonies were also renamed.
