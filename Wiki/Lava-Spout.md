A **Lava Spout** is a small geological feature present on volcanically-active planets and moons that emits smoke, flames, and sometimes lava. Depending on the ferocity of their eruption, they can emit tremendous heat and cause damage to a nearby ship, SRV, or on-foot CMDR. Needle Crystals may be found in the vicinity, making them a great target for raw material farming.
