**Livery** are cosmetic items for Ships, Ship-Launched Fighters, and SRVs. Livery items can be purchased with ARX from the in-game *Elite Dangerous* Store. These are added or removed via the Livery menu in the game's main menu or at any Station with Outfitting services. Available Livery items include: decals, paintjobs, dashboard ornaments, ship kits, engine and weapon colours, name plates, and cockpit voice UI. Livery are purely visual: they do not alter a ship performance or specifications in any way.

## Compatibility

Not all Livery options are available for every vehicle. The table below identifies vehicles that are incompatible with certain Livery options.

| Livery Option | Incompatible Vehicles |
| --- | --- |
| Cockpit Customisation | F63 Condor, Gu-97, Scarab, Taipan, XG7 Trident, XG8 Javelin, XG9 Lance |
| COVAS | None |
| Decals | None |
| Engine Colours | Scarab |
| Name Plates | F63 Condor, Gu-97, Scarab, Taipan, XG7 Trident, XG8 Javelin, XG9 Lance |
| Paintjobs | XG7 Trident, XG8 Javelin, XG9 Lance |
| Ship Kits | F63 Condor, Gu-97, Scarab, Taipan, XG7 Trident, XG8 Javelin, XG9 Lance |
| Weapon Colours | None |

Note that Fleet Carriers are not factored into this table because they have their own specific Livery options. Name Plates are the only Livery item that is compatible with both standard ships and Fleet Carriers.

## Decals

Decals are icons, emblems, and logos that can be placed on up to three predetermined locations on a ship's hull. Each slot can be equipped with a different decal, and decal colours automatically change to suit the ship's paintjob. Decals from the Store cost between 50 and 150 ARX, but a number of decals can be earned or acquired for free during gameplay.

### Pilots Federation rank decals

The Pilots Federation decals^[1]^ are earned through gameplay. There are three types: Combat, Trade, and Exploration. As a CMDR achieves a higher rank in one of the three fields, they will earn the corresponding decal. There are a total of 8 decals per field (there are no decals for the beginner rank in each).

A Triple Elite decal, unlocked by reaching Elite in all three categories, was added in Chapter Four (3.3) of *Elite Dangerous: Beyond*.^[2]^

### Community Goal decals

Beginning on March 29, 2018, exclusive decals were implemented as a reward for participation in select Community Goals. Acquiring the decal usually entails reaching a certain participation threshold, such as being a top 75% contributor, or supporting the winning faction in a pair of competing CGs. Usually, but not always, multiple colours of the CG are available depending on which participation threshold the player reached, including standard, bronze, silver, gold, and "emissive" variants. Some decals may be offered as a reward in more than one CG.^[3]^^[4]^^[5]^

### Interstellar Initiative decals

Interstellar Initiatives can also offer exclusive decals for participation. These decals are only available while an Interstellar Initiative is active, and can be unlocked by docking at specific stations related to them.

### Store decals

The following decals are available for purchase from the Store for 20 to 150 ARX each.

- **Commercial**
    - 12 decals of generic logos suitable for corporations.

- **Creepy Emissive**
    - Six luminescent, Halloween-themed decals.

- **Onionhead**
    - One "Oh" quasi-periodic table emblem, and two smiley faces.

### Other player group decals

Decals have been granted by Frontier Developments to other groups of players:

## Paintjobs

A paintjob can only be applied to the specific ship, SRV, or ship-launched fighter for which it was created and thus cannot be equipped on any other type. If the painted ship is destroyed the player can re-apply it to the replacement ship any time they are docked at a station with an "Outfitting" facility.

Paint degrades by wear over time, which can be seen in the external camera view. If a new paintjob is applied to the ship, the wear remains. Paint wear can only be removed by specifically repairing the paint in the ship maintenance facility at a station (Station Services &gt; Advanced Maintenance &gt; Repair &gt; Paintwork). Note the "repair all" option does not repair paint wear.

Paintjobs for SRVs and Ship-Launched Fighters cost between 460 and 3,280 ARX each. Paintjobs for Ships cost between 620 and 5,520 ARX each.

### Standard paintjobs

All 65 standard paintjob series, which are permanently available in the Store, are listed below. Most paintjob series are only available to a subset of vehicle models.

## Cockpit Customisation

### Dashboard Ornaments

Dashboard Ornaments are small, decorative objects such as bobbleheads, holograms, and potted plants that can be placed on a ship's cockpit dashboard. The dashboard has a total of ten ornament slots, and any ornament can be placed in multiple slots at the same time. Ornaments cost between 2,450 and 6,450 ARX each. Some ornaments are only offered on the Store on a seasonal basis.

Holographic trophies can also be unlocked for members of Squadrons that earn a top-three position on the seven seasonal Squadron Leaderboards. Each Leaderboard can reward a bronze (3rd place), silver (2nd place), or gold trophy (1st place) with an icon unique to that Leaderboard.^[22]^

The Interstellar Initiative The Enclave introduced a third method of acquiring bobbleheads: Technology Broker recipes. A recipe for a bobblehead of a Thargoid Interceptor was permanently added to Human Technology Broker inventories as a reward for the event.^[23]^

### String Lights

String Lights are a string of decorative lights in various colour combinations that are used to adorn a ship's cockpit canopy. Some sets feature ornaments. A slot for String Lights was first added to the Livery menu in August 2017, but it was not until December 2017 that the first set was sold on the Frontier Store. String Light sets are listed below, in chronological order of release:

- Festive (Seasonal item - Christmas)
- Warm White
- Pumpkin (Seasonal item - Halloween)
- Ancient Orb
- Thargoid Sensor
- New Year Lanterns (Seasonal item - Lunar New Year)
- Neon Skulls (Seasonal item - Halloween)
- Sugar Skulls (Seasonal item - Day of the Dead)

## Detailing

### Engine Colours

Introduced the same week as the v2.3.10 update,^[24]^ colours can be purchased for Thrusters and their exhaust contrails. Each colour can be used on any ship the player owns (including ship-launched fighters, but not the SRV). Engine Colours cost 2,240 ARX each.

### Weapon Colours

Weapon colour sets change a ship's weapons fire from the default colours. Each set is a single colour and changes all weapons on the ship to that colour. Combining multiple colours on a ship is not possible. Weapon Colours cost 2,240 ARX each.

Custom weapon colour sets will partially override custom effects applied by Engineering (such as the colour change applied by Scramble Spectrum) and alter any passive lighting effects (such as the glow from Guardian Gauss Cannons).

### Ship Kits

Ship Kits are cosmetic modifications that alter the exterior appearance of a ship, such as fins, winglets, fenders, etc. Each kit has multiple pieces (currently 12 to 16) that can be added in multiple combinations to create a variety of individual looks, though only one piece can be selected per "slot". 

There are three types of ship kits:

- Standard, consisting of various conventional addon components such as spoilers and winglets.
- "Raider", with rusty, ramshackle scrap-metal components. Raider kits also include six 'Corroded' Paint Jobs. Raider kits are used by reinforcement dropoff ships in some On Foot activities.
- "Hazard", with rugged, industrial parts such as roll cages. Hazard kits include six 'Hazard' Paint Jobs and fully functional floodlights that are toggled along with the ship's main lights, but have only one part for each slot.^[25]^

Ship Kits cost 11,750 ARX for a 12-piece kit, and 13,520 ARX for a 16-piece kit.

Ship Kits are available for the following ships:

### Name Plates

Introduced in the The Commanders v2.3 update, users can specify names and ID numbers for their ships.^[26]^ To make these appear on the ship's hull, stylised plates must be purchased from the Store. Name Plate packs include 9 plates (3 designs each in white, grey, and black) and cost 2,250 ARX each. Name Plates can be used on any ship the player owns; notably, Name Plates are the only Livery item that are compatible with both standard ships and Fleet Carriers.

The exact position of Name Plates varies from ship to ship, but each ship has one pair of plates that can only be used for the ID, and a second pair of plates that can be used for either the ID or the full name. In most cases, the former pair will be near the rear part of the hull and the latter pair near the front, though exceptions (such as the Krait MkII, where the ID-only plates are near the front and the full-name plates are further back) do exist. Ships typically come equipped with small floodlights positioned to keep the name and ID areas lit.

On Fleet Carriers, the owner can only use Name Plates to show the vessel's name on its hull, not its ID. There are two areas, one on either side of the vessel's Landing Pads, where Name Plates are displayed. The exact positions of these areas changes depending on which Fleet Carrier Layout is currently equipped.

### COVAS

Introduced in Beyond Chapter One (3.0), users can now choose between multiple COVAS ship/SRV voice options. Two English COVAS voices (Verity and Victor) and five localised COVAS voices (Amélie, Gerhard, Luciana, Maksim, and Vitória) are included as default/free options as of *Beyond* Chapter 4 (3.3). Additional COVAS options can be purchased for 8,850 ARX each.

## Fleet Carrier Livery

Drake-Class Carriers, introduced in the Fleet Carriers Update, have their own unique Livery options. Although certain Fleet Carrier Livery types overlap with standard Livery types that were not specific to ship models, such as Paintjobs and Detailing, Fleet Carrier Livery cannot be used on standard ships, and standard Livery cannot be used on Fleet Carriers.

### Layouts

Layouts are cosmetic modifications that can be applied to change the exterior appearance of a Fleet Carrier. Unlike Ship Kits, which consist of a collection of interchangeable parts, Layouts are a single-piece cosmetic. Layouts cost 12,450 ARX each.

- Fortune-Class Carrier - *"Fortune favors the bold, and the bold favor the Fortune Class Carrier!"*
- Nautilus-Class Carrier - *"Become a dreadnought in space with the Nautilus Class Carrier! For those who always want to be the bigger fish."*
- Victory-Class Carrier - *"For the Commanders that charge headfirst into the fray. The Victory Class Carrier ensures you're always one step ahead."*

### Detailing

Fleet Carriers have two Detailing types: Holo-Marker, and Carrier-Drive Colour.

Carrier-Drive Colours change the colours of a Fleet Carrier's thruster flames, and cost 4,180 ARX each.

### ATC

Fleet Carrier ATC (Air Traffic Controller) options are the Fleet Carrier equivalent of COVAS options for standard ships. ATCs are the "voices" of Fleet Carriers, and are heard by all players when they enter or exit a Fleet Carrier's no-fire zone, request docking permission, dock or launch on a Landing Pad, and experience Fleet Carrier jump countdowns. All Fleet Carriers include the Kelvin ATC as a free, default option, and all other Fleet Carrier ATCs cost 4,870 ARX each.
