Nova Navy is a group formed of independent pilots dedicated to supporting Hadrian Augustus Duval, a long-lost member of the Imperial royal bloodline. The group is headquartered in the Dyson City station within the Paresa system, where it works alongside the Nova Paresa organisation (formerly known as Nova Imperium) to provide safe haven for Hadrian's supporters.

In 3305, the Empire began a coordinated massacre of Nova Imperium members. Kaeso Mordanticus, the prior leader of Nova Imperium, was captured and executed within the Imperial Senate alongside several Senators who had supported his cause^[1]^. In addition to the Empire-wide executions of Nova members, any who had given them assistance were arrested for treason^[2]^. Hadrian Duval and the survivors of the purge were forced into hiding in the Paresa system, where he broadcast a call for assistance to the galactic community^[3]^.

Nova Navy was formed in response, with the goal of protecting Hadrian Duval and Nova Imperium from the ongoing purge. With the aid of the Nova Navy, Hadrian Duval and his supporters were able to reverse their fortunes, the scattered survivors of the purge coming together to take control of the Paresa system among many others. The Empire finally reversed its position in 3307, granting royal pardons to Hadrian and his supporters, ending the purge^[4]^. Nova Paresa now controls over 40 star systems, with a population of more than 100 billion citizens.
