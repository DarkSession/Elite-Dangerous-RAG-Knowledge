The **Enforcer Cannon** is a multi-cannon capable of dealing higher damage at the cost of a lower rate of fire. Despite the low rate of fire, a significant barrel spin-up time is required. This weapon is a merit reward in Powerplay.

It is available as a small class 1 weapon, fixed option only, and is visually represented by the small fixed multi-cannon model.

Compared directly to the class 1 fixed multi-cannon, overall DPS is 145%, and ROF is 56%. Despite having a smaller clip size of 60, the Enforcer Cannon will expend it - and its entire ammunition store - in roughly the same sustained firing time as the multi-cannon. It also has a slightly longer maximum range (4500m) and a significantly longer Damage Falloff range of 3000m. Additionally, the Enforcer Cannon has a small but notable amount of knockback, similar to a weakened version of Force Shell.

In combat, the Enforcer Cannon's higher DPS likely makes it superior to an equivalent multi-cannon against moderate to large targets (especially with engineering to increase its damage further), although its lack of gimballed variant and its spin up time seem to disadvantage it against the smaller, more nimble ships that a small multi-cannon will usually be expected to be effective against.

One of the most useful uses for an Enforcer Cannon is in Piracy. Many players choose to disable a target and then slow it to near-stationary, allowing Limpets to better collect ejected cargo. Enforcer Cannons' small and rapid knockback allow target ships to be precisely slowed, making this process much easier, especially compared to the standard method of ramming ships to a halt!
