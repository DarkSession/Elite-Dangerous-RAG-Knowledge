## Historical information

### Founded

Pre-3255

The **Holloway Bioscience Institute** is an independent research corporation based at the Holloway Biology Centre in Colonia. Founded by the scientist Lord Roland Holloway in the mid-33rd century, its mission is to study the various xenological lifeforms that have been discovered across the galaxy. In recent years, the institute's focus has been vacuum-dwelling lifeforms found in Notable Stellar Phenomena. In January 3307, the Holloway Bioscience Institute succeeded in replicating Notable Stellar Phenomena in the form of Experimental Habitats placed in the Colonia Region. In October 3307, pilots uncovered an abandoned Holloway research facility near the Core Systems that the institute had lost contact with in 3255.

Following the shutdown of Aegis on January 18, 3308, its xenological research projects were transferred to high-security laboratories operated by the Holloway Bioscience Institute, Imperial Science Academy, and Olympus Village University.

## Timeline

18 JAN 3308

- The Alliance, Empire and Federation have accepted the Baumann Report's recommendation to permanently shut down Aegis. The independent inquiry's findings on the organisation's failings will result in Aegis being immediately shut down. However, Chief Administrator Carter Armstrong has cautioned that "full demobilisation of staff, ships and resources might take several months". Senator Denton Patreus has successfully obtained senatorial approval for an increased military budget, to allow the Imperial Navy to directly take on the role played by Aegis. Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori likewise confirmed that the Federal Congress has ordered the creation of a new naval strike force. On his own authority he has also commissioned an investigation into Salvation, following Ram Tah's testimony regarding the nature of the anti-xeno superweapon. Admiral Nikolas Glass, who was recently appointed to the Council of Admirals, stated that the Alliance Defence Force and Sirius Navy will work in conjunction to fulfil Aegis's purpose. Xenological research laboratories set up by Professor Alba Tesreau will now transfer their work to specialist departments in the Holloway Bioscience Institute, Imperial Science Academy and Olympus Village University. In 3304 the Thargoids made targeted strikes against Aegis's labs, but all three institutions have made assurances that the new locations will have the highest security.^[1]^

10 NOV 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
A distress call has led independent pilots to locate an abandoned settlement in the Snake Sector GW-W c1-1 system. The SOS was initially detected by one of the megaships that form the Colonia Bridge, inspiring many ships to search nearby systems. The source was eventually identified as Holloway Bioscience Research Facility 15 on the moon Snake Sector GW-W c1-1 AB 5 b. Pilots unearthed a series of mission logs recorded in the year 3255 by a freelance military unit named Excalibur Troop. As yet, the contents of these logs have not been made available to newsfeeds. Aanya Gupta, CEO of the Holloway Bioscience Institute, gave a statement to the press: "Research Facility 15 was one of the first wave of planetary survey laboratories established by our founder, the esteemed scientist Lord Roland Holloway. Our records of these settlements are patchy, so we are grateful that this has been located. Unfortunately, we can find no data regarding Excalibur Troop or the circumstances under which they were contracted. Our investigative teams are on-site to gather further information." The Holloway Bioscience Institute refused to comment on rumours that a previously unidentified life form had been encountered by the research facility's original crew.^[2]^

29 OCT 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Thirty megaships have been placed between the core systems and the Colonia region to serve as stationary ports. Twenty-five dockable megaships were sent out from the Alcor system toward Colonia, taking position in systems approximately 400 to 500 light years apart. Five further megaships have been established from the direction of the Colonia system. Each vessel serves as a permanent way station for travellers and businesses, designed to improve the journey to and from Colonia. A variety of services are provided, including tritium refuelling for Drake-class fleet carriers. The Colonia Bridge is the product of Brewer Corporation, which ran a highly successful deliveries campaign to collect resources. The megacorp has confirmed that phase two of this project will commence next week. During the creation of the Colonia Bridge, the crew aboard the stationary megaship Memories of Oresrati in the Snake Sector OD-S b4-2 system reported an unusual incident. A distorted transmission that could have been an SOS was detected on long-range sensors. Although they were unable to triangulate its source, the signal strength suggested a point of origin within 50 light years.^[3]^

29 OCT 3307

- Vox Galactica's culture correspondent Lishan Abara looks at the Colonia region, the largest enclave of humanity outside the core systems: "Colonia. A place that few ever see, which exists following a computer malfunction. The famed Jaques Station suffered a mis-jump on its scheduled journey to Beagle Point, relocating some 22,000 light years from Sol. The subsequent rescue effort led to the establishment of the first permanent base in what is now considered a new frontier for humanity. Over the last five years, courageous explorers have struck out to inhabit several dozen local systems. This, in turn, invited a steady stream of colonists seeking a fresh start. Nearly 13 million souls now count this remote area as their home. This is a place beyond the influence of the superpowers and mega-corporations, and most residents prefer it that way. The Colonia Council works hard to maintain order, helping local organisations function along cooperative lines. There have been a handful of regional conflicts, but generally you're less likely to witness trouble out here. Having become self-sufficient early on, Colonia's healthy economy encourages both traders and tourists to make the long journey. The scientific community maintains a notable presence, a notable example is the Holloway Bioscience Institute, which studies the many vacuum-dwelling life forms found in the Colonia Nebula. Independent and faction-aligned pilots are catered to, with shipyards and even a fleet carrier construction dock found in the area. Local engineers such as Baltanos, Eleanor Bresa, Rosa Dayette and Yi Shen also offer suit and personal equipment modifications to those who make a living working on low-atmosphere worlds. With the Colonia Bridge project well underway, it will soon be easier than ever to cross the interstellar gulf and reach this distant haven. Businesses, settlers and visitors alike may find themselves increasingly drawn to the Colonia experience."^[4]^

14 JAN 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
The Holloway Bioscience Institute has rewarded pilots who delivered living matter extracted from space-dwelling organisms. Many shipments of seed pod tissue samples arrived at Jaques Station, from where they will be transported to the Holloway Biology Centre on Colonia 7 G. These will be used to replenish stocks used in the facility's experimentation programme. Dr Roy Casimir, chief researcher at the centre, expressed his gratitude: "These vital supplies mean that we can resume our studies on the incredible organisms that float through the void. Here at Holloway we're making many breakthroughs in the field of xenobiology, some with intriguing commercial possibilities." The Holloway Bioscience Institute now plans to establish experimental habitats for vacuum lifeforms in the following systems:
Eol Prou PC-K c9-221
Eol Prou LW-L c8-99
Eol Prou KW-L c8-301
Eol Prou PC-K c9-154
Pilots who contributed to this initiative can now collect their rewards from Jacques Station in the Colonia system.^[5]^

07 JAN 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
The Holloway Bioscience Institute in Colonia is offering high payouts for delivering samples from space-dwelling lifeforms. The Holloway Biology Centre on Colonia 7 G is the organisation's primary research laboratory, which specialises in xenological studies. Jaques Station, which is also in the Colonia system, has agreed to serve as the delivery point for this initiative. Chief researcher Dr Roy Casimir outlined the requirements: "There is still a huge amount to learn about the fascinating structures that grow within the vacuum of space. As our stock of specimens is running low, we require fresh tissue samples from living organisms to continue our experimentation programme. I appreciate that our facility is located a considerable distance from the core systems, but we're willing to offer generous reimbursement for those who make the journey." Pilots are requested to extract any type of tissue sample, including pod mesoglea, from any type of seed pod. These are to be delivered to Jaques Station in the Colonia system.^[6]^

11 DEC 3305

- Following months of setbacks, the Holloway Biology Centre has finally opened in the Colonia system. The research centre will focus on the study of newly catalogued lifeforms. Dr Roy Casimir, chief researcher at the Holloway Bioscience Institute, held a press conference at the opening ceremony, and discussed the delays that followed a successful campaign to found the centre in February this year: "Our study of the lifeforms discovered over the past year formed the basis of the research centre's designs. As the volume of scans provided by the galactic community continued to grow, it became apparent that we lacked the laboratory space required to study it all. As a result, the Holloway Bioscience Institute committed to several months of investment and redesign, to ensure that a wide variety of material could be analysed. We are confident that this decision will prove more than worthwhile, and our scientists are excited to work in this state-of-the-art facility." The Holloway Biology Centre is located in the Colonia system on Colonia 7 G.^[7]^

14 FEB 3305

- A campaign from the Holloway Bioscience Institute to build a xenological research centre has concluded successfully. Chief researcher Dr Roy Casimir told the media: "Thanks to Nahuaru Crimson Bridge Int we now have sufficient materials to build a planetary outpost where our scientists can study lifeforms identified by the galactic community. We are also grateful for the exploration data provided by many pilots, which will help us create a new research catalogue." Pilots who took part in the campaign can now collect their rewards from Williams Vision in the Nahuaru system.^[8]^

07 FEB 3305

- Dr Roy Casimir of the Holloway Bioscience Institute has announced plans to construct a research centre focusing on new life forms discovered by the galactic community: "The development of the Codex has led to a number of xenological discoveries. Our aim is to construct a dedicated scientific facility to analyse these incredible lifeforms. We therefore request quantities of Cobalt, Indium and Tantalum to be delivered to Williams Vision in the Nahuaru system. In addition, we ask pilots to provide us with exploration data, which will form the core of our xenological research catalogue. Nahuaru Crimson Bridge Int has agreed to fund the initiative and reimburse contributing pilots." The initiative begins on the 7th of February 3305 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.^[9]^
