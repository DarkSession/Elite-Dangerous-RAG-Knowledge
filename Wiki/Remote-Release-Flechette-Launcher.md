## Usage

This weapon shares similarities with the Remote Release Flak Launcher. Holding down the weapon fire will launch a dumbfire missile directly ahead. When in range, the indicator will flash red to alert the player to release and detonate the missile, exploding it into a ball of metallic shards. The metal shards appear to persist for a short while, but appear to deal no damage after initial activation.

The most noteworthy aspect of this weapon is its interaction with shields. It will bounce off an active shield without detonating, but, the weapon is still active. Releasing the fire button in close proximity to a shielded target will cause the target to receive hull and module damage, as well as inflicting the Hull Breach debuff. It has 100% chance per hit at max and minimum integrity to cause a hull break, increasing damage dealt to the modules of a target vessel from all other weapons.
