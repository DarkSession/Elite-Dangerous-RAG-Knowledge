## Trivia

- Alcor, (from Arabic: “Faint One”) also called 80 Ursae Majoris, star with apparent magnitude of 4.01. Alcor makes a visual double with the brighter star Mizar in the middle of the handle of the Big Dipper (Ursa Major). The two are 1.2 light-years apart and may be gravitationally bound to each other. Alcor itself is orbited by a faint red companion star. The ability to separate the dim star Alcor from Mizar 0.2° away with the unaided eye may have been regarded by the Arabs (and others) as a test of good vision. The pair have also been called the Horse and Rider.^[1]^
