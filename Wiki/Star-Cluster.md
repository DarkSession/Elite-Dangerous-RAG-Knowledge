# Star Cluster
A **Star Cluster** or star cloud is a group of stars. There are two types of star clusters: Globular Clusters and Open Clusters. Globular Clusters are a tight group of hundreds or thousands of stars, which are gravitationally bound.

There are a variety of star clusters in *Elite Dangerous* that contain rich survey data opportunities.

## Trumpler 16

 	 	[![Trumpler 16](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/1b/Trumpler_16.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20170219155821)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/1b/Trumpler_16.png/revision/latest?cb=20170219155821) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Trumpler 16
 		 	 

**Trumpler 16** is the home of WR 25 (not the actual in-game designation), currently the most luminous star known in our Milky Way galaxy, together with the less luminous but more massive and famous **Eta Carinae** star system and the O2 supergiant HD 93129A (not the actual in-game designation). 

**Trumpler 16** can be located by navigating to **CPD-59 2574**.

**Eta Carinae** can be located by name, using the search tool.

## Trumpler 14

 	 	[![TRUMPLER 14](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/3/39/TRUMPLER_14.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20170219164326)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/3/39/TRUMPLER_14.png/revision/latest?cb=20170219164326) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Trumpler 14
 		 	 

**Trumpler 14** is about half a million years old and one of the youngest known star clusters in the galaxy. Becuase it is located within the inner parts of the Carina Nebula, Trumpler 14 is currently undergoing massive star formation. As a result, the star cluster exhibits many stars of late **O** to early **A** spectral type, which are very massive (at least 10 solar masses), short-lived and hot (20,000 K).

**Trumpler 14** can be located by navigating to **CPD-57 3518**.

A class A blue supergiant can be located near the cluster by navigating to **HD 91969**.

## Messier 67

 	 	[![Messier 67](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/f/f4/Messier_67.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20170220090659)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/f/f4/Messier_67.png/revision/latest?cb=20170220090659) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Messier 67
 		 	 

**Messier 67** (also known as M67, NGC 2682, or the Cancri Cluster) is an open cluster in the constellation of Cancer.

The cluster had previously been out of reach due to the 219-light-year gap between **Outotch SA-U d4-0** and **AH Cancri**. However, due to a recent discovery of a massive FSD boost via neutron star, what is known as the "Cancri Climb" became possible. M67 does not contain any neutron stars and thus the trip home is currently impossible without the use of a fleet carrier.

**Messier 67** can be located by navigating to **NGC 2682 FBC 4778**.

## NGC 3590

NGC 3590
 		 	 

**NGC 3590** is a small open cluster of stars located in the constellation of Carina (the Keel) and is roughly 35 million years old. 

**NGC 3590** can be located by navigating to **2MASS J11130656-6047542**.

## Orion Nebula

    - *Main article: Orion Nebula*

 	 	[![Orion Nebula](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/b4/Orion_Nebula.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20170225092950)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/b4/Orion_Nebula.png/revision/latest?cb=20170225092950) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Orion Nebula
 		 	 

The **Orion Nebula** (also known as Messier 42, M42, or NGC 1976) is a diffuse nebula situated in the Milky Way. It is one of the brightest nebulae and is visible to the naked eye in the night sky. The M42 nebula is estimated to be 24 light years across. It is one of the most scrutinised and photographed objects in the night sky and is among the most intensely studied celestial features. The **Orion Nebula** contains a very young open cluster, known as the **Trapezium** due to the asterism (any pattern of stars recognized in the Earth's night sky) of its primary four stars.

There are seven star clusters associated with the nebulae in the Orion region:

1. Trapezium
2. NGC 1981
3. Collinder 70
4. Collinder 69
5. NGC 1976
6. NGC 1977
7. NGC 2232

### Trapezium

The **Trapezium** or Orion Trapezium Cluster, also known by its Bayer designation of Theta Orionis, is a tight open cluster of stars in the heart of the **Orion Nebula**, in the constellation of Orion. It is a relatively young cluster that has formed directly out of the parent nebula and may be a sub-component of the larger **Orion Nebula Cluster**.

This star cluster is most readily identifiable by the asterism of four relatively bright stars for which it is named. The four are often identified as A, B, C, and D in order of increasing right ascension. The brightest of the four stars is C, or Theta Orionis C.

### NGC 1981

 	 	[![NGC 1981](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/52/NGC_1981.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20170225093919)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/52/NGC_1981.png/revision/latest?cb=20170225093919)

NGC 1893
 		 	 

> 
> 
> This is an open cluster of class B stars. As such it is nothing especially remarkable except that it sits within the sparsely populated rift within the Outer Arm Vacuus, thus making them really stand out against the sparsely populated backdrop. The cluster requires an engineered frameshift drive or the use of FSD boosts to reach."

**The Hyades** (also known as Melotte 25 or Collinder 50) is the nearest open cluster to the Solar System and one of the best-studied star clusters. The age of the cluster is estimated to be about 625 million years old. From the perspective of observers on Earth, the **Hyades** Cluster appears in the constellation Taurus, where its brightest stars form a "V" shape along with the still brighter red giant **Aldebaran**. However, **Aldebaran** is unrelated to the **Hyades**, as it is located much closer to Earth (hence its apparent brightness) and merely happens to lie along the same line of sight.

**The Hyades** can be located by navigating to **Hyadum I**.

## Collinder 121

 	 	[![Collinder 121](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/9/93/Collinder_121.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20170428084049)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/9/93/Collinder_121.png/revision/latest?cb=20170428084049)

Collinder 140
 		 	 

**Collinder 140** is an open cluster that contains approximately 40 stars and is estimated to be some 20 million years old. Its central star, **HIP 38064,** features unusually large stellar objects with rings, including a class M star, a class L brown dwarf, and two class Y brown dwarfs. The class O primary star lights up the rings with vivid blue and purple colours.

The nearest two planets are in close proximity to the star as well as each other, creating spectacular views. Planet 2 contains a tourist beacon with information on the original discovery of this area. Commanders should take great care when landing on it; as high gravity is present, and its proximity to the star may cause overheating.
