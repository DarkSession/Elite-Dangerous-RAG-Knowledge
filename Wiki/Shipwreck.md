F63 Condor shipwreck on a planet
 		 	 

    - *For Thargoid shipwreck sites, see Crashed Thargoid Ship.*

**Shipwrecks** are sites found on planetary surfaces. They consist of derelict human ships, SRVs or on rare occasions alien vessels such as the Crashed Thargoid Ship*.* They may have scattered Commodities and Materials.

## Finding

Some were located by following transmissions from nearby Listening Posts. This usually involves finding a trio of related Listening Posts and combining their fragmentary data logs to determine the shipwreck's system, body, and surface coordinates. Other locations were randomly distributed to commanders by anonymous sources via "Tip Off" messages. These contain full details about the site and a single-use key that allows valuable Data Packages from the Ship Data Core to be downloaded. Many shipwrecks have uplinks that can be scanned with a Data Link Scanner to retrieve text and audio logs that were recorded by the ship's crew or the owner. The logs shed light on the cause of the crash, destruction or abandonment.

## Notes

- Shipwrecks are not to be confused with generic Points of Interest which appear on planetary surfaces. Points of Interest appear randomly during surface exploration, and are neither static nor persistent sites. One way to determine if a crashed ship is a true Shipwreck or a temporary Point of Interest is to see if the site has a persistent nav point which can be selected from orbit.
