## Usage

Passengers can be housed in cabins of equal or higher quality than their listed requirement.

All VIP passengers will occupy an entire cabin regardless of how many members are in their party. They will occupy the cabin until the mission is completed or dropped. Non-VIP passengers are housed by seat rather than cabin. This means pilots can carry multiple groups in one cabin or even split the groups among different cabins (having the same class).

Unlike Cargo Racks, Passenger Cabins have mass even when empty. However, this mass remains constant and does not increase when passengers are boarded.

Any ship with an appropriate compartment can equip Economy, Business or First Class Passenger Cabins, however only the Dolphin, Orca, and Beluga Liner can be equipped with Luxury Class Passenger Cabins.

Passenger Cabins cannot be mounted into Military Compartments.

## Notes

- Passenger Cabins were added in the *Elite Dangerous: Horizons* The Guardians (2.2).^[1]^
- A fifth class of Passenger Cabins, Prisoner Cells, was also planned but never fully implemented, despite being listed in the patch notes for *Horizons* The Commanders (2.3).^[2]^ According to Senior Programmer Dominic Corner, Prisoner Cells are lower than Economy Class in quality and while they technically exist within the game, they cannot yet be purchased by players. A bug occasionally causes some passenger transport missions that require Prisoner Cells to generate.^[3]^
