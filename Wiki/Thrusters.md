**Thrusters** are what propels a ship when flying in normal space. Upgraded thrusters can accommodate heavier ships, increase ship speed and improve manoeuvrability. If the Optimal Mass of a ship is exceeded, it will be unable to travel at its top speed until its mass is lowered below the Optimal Mass threshold.

## Theory based on player-gathered data

 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Mamba ship thrusters
 		 	 

A ship's top speed is based on the ratio of optimal mass of the equipped thrusters to the total mass of the ship. This ratio is only linear in the case of C-rated thrusters. A- & B-rated thrusters are positively concave, meaning that they benefit more from a total mass lower than optimal mass and have less of a disadvantage from a total mass higher than optimal mass. D- & E-rated thrusters have the opposite effect.^[1]^

At a total mass identical to the optimal mass of the equipped thrusters, a ship's top speed will always be identical to the advertised speed, no matter the rating. This does not mean that a higher rated thrusters won't have a benefit over lower ratings, as they have a higher optimal mass.^[1]^

Power Distributor rating and class appears to have no effect on top speed (outside of its mass), but the number of pips allocated to engines do. Top speed per pip allocated is a linear function, meaning that 2 pips will have a speed exactly between 4 pips and 0 pips, but the speed modifier of 0 allocated pips depends on a hidden value belonging to the ship, as can be seen in the table below.^[1]^^[2]^

| --- | --- |
| Type-9 Heavy | 0.305 |

## Manoeuvring Thrusters

The main thruster(s) obviously push the ship forward, but generally also have flaps to redirect thrust or are even capable of being swivelled and re-pointed, which allows them also to control the direction of the ship. However all ships have multiple smaller thrusters situated in relevant locations over their hull: these are the manoeuvring thrusters, and allow for more refined directional changes. 

Manoeuvring thrusters fire automatically in response of the pilot's stick movements. Pilots will see them as small jets emitting from points along their ship as they move the stick. Turning off Flight Assist will give the manoeuvring thrusters more control over the ship's orientation at the cost of less control over its forward motion.

The force applied by the manoeuvring thrusters relative to the ship mass is used to specify a ship's manoevrability rating, but there are exceptions. It is assumed that upgrading thrusters also upgrades manoeuvring capability, but the effect has not yet been quantified. 

Although they are clearly based on a real physical model, the individual manoeuvring thrusters or arrays were never named by any official publication from Frontier Developments, but in a simplified way they can be labelled by their real-life equivalents.

**Retro** (or reverse) thrusters are those which act in the opposite direction than the main thruster, causing a "braking" effect. Some ships are known for their retros being weak compared to their main thrust (such as the Asp Explorer). Pilots in such ships need to take especial care not to collide at high speed with objects such as stations, especially after boosting. Conversely, strong retro thrusters (such as on the Mamba) allow a pilot to reverse in the face of an oncoming target keep all front-mounted hardpoint weapons on them, and even to decelerate suddenly and allow a pursuer to overshoot and become pursued himself.

It is a common misconception that air resistance is responsible for slowing ships when landing gear is engaged, but in reality it is due to main thruster power being redirected to the manoeuvring thrusters. When landing gear is engaged, a ship can move freely in every direction without changing orientation, but not very quickly.
