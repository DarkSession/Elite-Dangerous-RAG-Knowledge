## Timeline

07 OCT 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
The battle between Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar and EG Union has concluded successfully for Yuri Grom's forces. Freelance war correspondent Karleen Troy reported via Vox Galactica: "For the past week, the Delta Pavonis system has been aflame with ship-to-ship engagements. But despite a fierce effort from Federal auxiliaries, EG Union was able to muster superior numbers. Eventually the Federal flagship, Freedom's Foundation, was boarded. I picked up comms chatter that described intense fighting before EG Union soldiers overran Federal troops. Since then I've learned that Yuri Grom has agreed to let the surviving crewmembers leave, but is claiming the megaship as 'spoils of war'." The following message was sent by Yuri Grom on public channels: "President Hudson has revealed his true nature as the corrupt heart of the Federation's rotting carcass. This treachery will not be forgotten." Pilots who supported Yuri Grom can collect their rewards from the Indomitable megaship. Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar confirmed that although the Freedom's Foundation is now under EG Union control, reimbursement for all Commanders who fought for Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar will be processed remotely by the 9th of October 3307.^[1]^

28 FEB 3305

- The battle in the Drevlyada system, which sprang from a long-running rivalry between two military leaders, has now ended. Warzone reporter Karleen Troy summarised: "The antagonistic relationship between General Kendrick and Marshal Cooper was finally resolved when both were executed by their own lieutenants, who were displeased with the huge loss of life resulting from their leaders' quarrel. Both the Namab Purple Brothers and the Drevlyada League have agreed to honour commitments to members of the galactic community who fought on each side." Independent pilots who took part in the conflict can now collect their rewards from the Drevlyada system. Supporters of Namab Purple Brothers should head to Wheeler Dock, while supporters of the Drevlyada League should travel to Grandin Port.^[2]^

21 FEB 3305

- A long-standing enmity between two military leaders has escalated into hostilities in the Drevlyada system. Details were provided by freelance warzone reporter Karleen Troy: "The personal rivalry between General Kendrick of Namab Purple Brothers and Marshal Cooper of Drevlyada League has lasted for years. Each frequently accuses the other of incompetence and endangering the people of Drevlyada. This grudge match has now spiralled into a state of open conflict. Both Kendrick and Cooper have asked the galactic community to provide support in crushing their opponent's forces." The two factions have set out week-long campaigns to take control of the Drevlyada system, which will begin on the 21st of February 3305.^[3]^

29 NOV 3304

- The conflict between two rival factions in the Loha system has now come to an end. Karleen Troy, freelance warzone reporter, delivered a report for the Vox Galactica news service: "This has been a harrowing week for the people of Loha. In that time, I've witnessed acts of brutality and heroism from both sides. But now that their resources are exhausted, overall control of the system has finally been established. For those pilots who took advantage of the conflict, this will have been a profitable exercise. Both factions have announced that pilots can now collect their rewards from Whitworth Station in the Loha system."^[4]^

22 NOV 3304

- A long-standing rivalry between two factions in the Loha system has erupted into full-scale conflict. The commencement of hostilities was announced on the Vox Galactica news service by Karleen Troy, a freelance warzone reporter: "Relations were already strained when Loha Holdings accused its rivals of hijacking transport ships and murdering their crews. After the New Loha Party claimed this was a false flag operation designed to discredit them, diplomacy was rapidly replaced by weapons fire. Since neither side has an extensive fleet, both Loha Holdings and the New Loha Party have appealed for support. I've received word that they're offering substantial rewards to independent combat pilots who can aid them in this conflict." The two factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 22nd of November 3304.^[5]^
