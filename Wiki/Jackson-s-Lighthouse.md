**Jackson's Lighthouse** is an uninhabited Federal system near the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It is the closest neutron star to Sol, at a distance of 174.01 ly away, and in recent years has become popular location for pilots to practice Frame Shift Drive supercharging. Despite the lack of any infrastructure, the system is claimed by the Federation and has a nominal security presence.
