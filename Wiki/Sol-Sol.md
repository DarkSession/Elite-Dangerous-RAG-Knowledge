**Sol**, also known as the Sun, is the star of the Sol system. It is a G2-V Main Sequence Star, also known as a Yellow Dwarf. It is brighter than 85% of all stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Sol makes up 99.86% of the mass of the Solar System and formed approximately 4.7 billion years ago; 5 billion years from now, Sol will expand into a Red Giant, consuming Mercury and overheating several other planets before eventually contracting into a White Dwarf.
