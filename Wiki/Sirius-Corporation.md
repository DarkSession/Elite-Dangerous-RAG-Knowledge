The **Sirius Corporation**, commonly known as **Sirius Corp.** or simply **Sirius**, is the oldest and most powerful of the mega corporations. While even larger mega corporations exist, such as Faulcon DeLacy,^[2]^ none of them compare to the wealth and influence of Sirius.^[3]^ Such is the impact of Sirius Corporation on galactic affairs that it is sometimes referred to as "the fourth superpower".^[4]^ Its headquarters is located in the Sirius system, which requires a permit that is only granted to Sirius's allies.

Sirius Corporation specializes in the development and production of fusion reactors, Power Generators, Hydrogen Fuel, and hyperdrive models such as the Frame Shift Drive, and it maintains an active interest in furthering the exploration and colonisation of the galaxy.^[3]^^[5]^ It is also one of the galaxy's two main personal computer suppliers, alongside the Achilles Corporation.^[6]^ Divisions of Sirius Corporation include Sirius Catering, Sirius Mining, Sirius Power, Sirius Luxury Transports, Sirius Industrial, Sirius Atmospherics. Another division, Sirius Gov, is a government body operated by Sirius to manage systems and populations directly under the corporation's control.^[3]^

Li Yong-Rui is the current CEO of Sirius Corporation. All stations in systems controlled or exploited by Li Yong-Rui offer a discount on modules, weapons, and ships to all independent pilots.

## History

### Founding

By 2200 corporations had a stranglehold on a great many aspects of life, and this did not stop during colonisation. The colonisation of Sirius by a solely corporate mission in 2339 and Sirius Corporation's rapid rise to become the premier supplier of drive fuel to first the Federation and then the Empire led to much corporate profiteering between the two superpowers. Throughout this period, conflicts of interest were raised by congressmen backed by corporate interests. However, Sirius Corporation delegates were also responsible for initiating negotiations between the superpowers in 2379 to end the long cold war that followed the Battle of Achenar, the first interstellar war. In 2381, this resulted in the signing of a formal peace treaty in which the Federation agreed to grant Achenar and its colonies full autonomy, as well as recognize the hereditary position of Emperor.^[7]^^[8]^^[2]^

### New Drive Technology

In 3278, the corporation saw a turnaround in its decline with the introduction of a new, faster drive system. Any similarities to the system in the Antares incident were denied at the time, though acknowledgements decades later revealed it was based on the results of the same research program. In the following years further improvements were made available both by Sirius and by its rivals, each dramatically reducing jump times, eventually resulted in very rapid hyperspace travel; journeys that previously took days could now be made in seconds.^[9]^ The new Frame Shift Drive (FSD) was released to the public in 3297, and by 3300 all registered ships had been upgraded with the new technology.^[2]^

Unknown to the general public, during the 3270s the Alliance reverse-engineered Thargoid technology to produce the Frame Shift Drive. To prevent any one power or faction from leveraging it, The Club ensured that this technology fell into the hands of Sirius Corporation, which monopolized it and distributed it to all powers and factions to provide a level playing field.^[10]^

Not only did the success of the FSD trigger a new period of galactic expansion, but it also resulted in the expansion of Sirius Corporation into various other fields, with offices throughout human space.^[9]^

### Bid for Ram Tah

On October 26, 3304, Sirius Corporation extended an offer to the engineer Ram Tah to establish a partnership for the purpose of expanding the development of human-Guardian hybrid technologies. The invitation came on the heels of an attempted incursion into Ram Tah's Phoenix Base in the Meene system, ostensibly to seize Guardian technology samples. Sirius CEO Li Yong-Rui remarked that Ram Tah would benefit from access to Sirius's resources and security.^[11]^ Ram Tah declined the offer, fearing that Sirius would try to monopolize the hybrid technology.^[12]^

A mercenary group was then intercepted and defeated in Meene on November 7 before they could attack Phoenix Base.^[13]^ In response, the system's security forces launched a campaign to sweep Meene for any other hostiles and recover their escape pods.^[14]^ A number of mercenaries were captured and interrogated, and it was found that several were junior officers in Sirius Corporation's private fleet. Amid accusations that Sirius had been trying to scare Ram Tah into accepting their offer, the company opened a full inquiry.^[15]^^[16]^

On November 23, Li Yong-Rui revealed the inquiry's findings: a cabal of junior Sirius officers had unofficially collaborated with mercenaries to illegally gain access to Phoenix Base, and had been acting without their superiors' knowledge. He issued a public apology to Ram Tah for his employees' actions, and confirmed they would face multiple charges and could be imprisoned for life.^[17]^ After Aegis stationed additional security forces in Meene to prevent further disruptions, Li Yong-Rui quietly withdrew his offer to work with Ram Tah.^[18]^

### Marlinist crisis intervention

In late 3306, the Federation and Empire threatened to go to war over the issue of Imperial Marlinist refugees who had fled to Federal territory to escape persecution. The Marlinist refugee crisis had been sparked by a series of terror attacks and political assassinations carried out within the Empire by the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army, a group of radicalized Marlinists who believed that the Empire should be converted into a representative democracy by use of force. While the Empire demanded the return of the refugees in order to ferret out any NMLA members, the Federation refused and granted them temporary asylum, creating a tense standoff. On December 10, Sirius Corporation decided to intervene to prevent a major conflict. CEO Yong-Rui presented a solution: resettle the Marlinist refugees in up to 10 new colonies in unclaimed systems. Both Federal Congress and the Imperial Senate approved the plan, with the caveat that any identified NMLA members among the refugees be turned over to the Empire. Dr. Jenna Fairfax, a Marlinist community leader, also voiced her approval of the plan, as it would end the uncertain predicament in which her people had been mired for weeks.^[19]^

Enough supplies were collected by the campaign's deadline on December 17 to colonize the first eight of the proposed systems. Construction of the Marlinist Colonies was expected to be completed in early 3307, after which the Marlinist refugees would be transported to their new homes. Marlinist community leader Aaron Whyte expressed his gratitude, but also remarked that the Marlinists' distant goal of peacefully reforming the Empire into a democracy remained unchanged.^[20]^ Construction work was underway by December 21, and the Marlinists began preparing for the move and setting up an interim government. The logistics of transporting the refugees to their new homes were to be managed by humanitarian aid organisation Safeguard Interstellar.^[21]^ The Marlinist Colonies were officially completed on January 14, 3307, by which time over 800 million Marlinist refugees had already been relocated to the new settlements.^[22]^

### The Galactic Summit

Sirius Corporation attempted to parlay its success with the Marlinist Colonies into proof that it was an impartial player on the galaxy's political stage. After Simguru Pranav Antal of Utopia proposed hosting a Galactic Summit for the three superpowers, CEO Li Yong-Rui countered with his own proposal to host the event, arguing that Sirius Corporation had more resources than Utopia, could provide better security, and was already trusted by the superpowers.^[23]^

On January 21, 3307, after the superpowers provisionally agreed to send delegates to the Galactic Summit and a tentative date in late February was set, Sirius Corporation and Utopia began competing campaigns in Lembava and Polevnic respectively to determine the most suitable host for the conference. Both organisations requested data materials to be used in the planning of security operations, and the group that received the most data would be declared the winner.^[24]^ Sirius Corporation was approved to host the Galactic Summit upon the campaign's conclusion on January 28 after it secured significantly more data than Utopia.^[25]^ On February 18, Sirius Corp revealed that the Galactic Summit would take place in the Sirius system, and requested deliveries of rare food commodities that would be served during the event. When the Alliance and Empire lodged complaints about the choice of Sirius given its location in Federal territory, CEO Yong-Rui pointed out that Sirius Corp was fully independent of the Federation, and all guests of the summit would be protected by diplomatic immunity.^[26]^ The initiative was a success, ensuring that the conference could begin without delay.^[27]^

Delegations began arriving and making formal introductions at Patterson Enterprise in Sirius on February 25. Li Yong-Rui announced that Sirius Corp would partner with a different superpower to provide security for each week of the Galactic Summit, starting with the Federation, then the Empire, and ending with the Alliance.^[28]^^[29]^ On March 4, Sirius Corporation controversially extended diplomatic immunity to Archon Delaine and a delegation from Kumo Crew, who arrived in Sirius unexpectedly and demanded to participate in the conference. Some ambassadors walked out in protest, and accused Sirius Corp of acquiescing to Delaine out of fear of provoking a large pirate incursion in Sirius.^[30]^

The Galactic Summit ended prematurely on March 11, after the NMLA carried out attacks on starports in nine major systems, including Achenar, Alioth, and Sol. The conference was cancelled because it was feared that Patterson Enterprise would be bombed next, and the delegations returned to their home systems under high security. One of the most anticipated achievements of the Galactic Summit, the Sirius Treaty, was left unsigned.^[31]^

### Grand ambitions?

Months later on June 15, 3307, Vox Galactic business analyst Marlon Royce pointed out that the Galactic Summit and other recent moves by Sirius Corporation appeared to be a concerted effort on the part of CEO Li Yong-Rui to broaden the corporation's political influence. Such was Sirius Corp's stature that it was already sometimes referred as "the fourth superpower", and Royce speculated that the corporation's ultimate aim was to achieve superpower status outright.^[4]^ Sirius Corp built on this momentum on June 17 by organising a public initiative to collect the necessary resources to enable the mass-production of an enhanced Detailed Surface Scanner for distribution via Technology Brokers.^[32]^^[33]^

On June 25, Councillor Nakato Kaine of the Alliance Assembly accused Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon of making a backroom deal with Sirius Corporation to help complete the construction of two new starports, Enterprise Market in LHS 2522 and Prosperity Core in Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19. Kaine's investigation revealed Mahon's tritium mining campaign to support the starports' construction had not collected enough material to fully build a second starport, docking records indicated that Sirius Corporation had made a number of unregistered donations, and Prosperity Core inexplicably hosted a Sirius Corporation presence at the time it opened. Sirius Corporation did not address the situation, but the Office of the Prime Minister confirmed that the mega corporation was a partner in the Alliance's expansion programme.^[34]^

With the launch of a new drug, Onionhead Gamma Strain, produced by Kumo Crew in partnership with the Blue Viper Club on July 23, Sirius Corp's previous dealings with Kumo Crew gave rise to speculation that it was a party to this deal, and had agreed to secretly ship Onionhead Gamma Strain to market with its freight transportation network. There was no evidence of such collusion, and VP of Corporate Marketing Sinclair Faraldo rejected the claims outright, but logistics experts noted that Onionhead Gamma Strain had been distributed with surprising speed.^[35]^

### Alliance-Sirius strategic defence pact

CEO Li Yong-Rui personally travelled to Alioth at the invitation of the Alliance Assembly on December 22 to discuss a potential strategic defence contract between Sirius Corporation and the Alliance. The talks were arranged at Prime Minister Mahon's suggestion, which came in response to fears that the Alliance Defence Force was unprepared for a Thargoid invasion of Alliance systems. Councillor Kaine warned that Sirius held too much influence over some of her colleagues, and demanded more transparency for any deals negotiated with the megacorp.^[36]^ Mahon announced the signing of a defence pact with Sirius Corp on January 3, 3308, following a rare, closed-door, joint vote of the Assembly and the Council of Admirals. While most of the terms of the pact were classified, Mahon explained that in exchange for certain financial opportunities, Sirius Corporation would support the ADF exclusively in anti-xeno operations.^[37]^

The pact came into effect on January 10, and was signified by the expansion of the Council of Admirals to accommodate Sirius Navy officer Admiral Nikolas Glass, who would take charge of coordinating the ADF and Sirius Navy's efforts against the Thargoids. While the change was endorsed by Prime Minister Mahon and Fleet Admiral Hayley Sorokin, who noted that the ADF lacked the firepower of the Federal and Imperial fleets and welcomed Sirius Corporation's support, Councillor Kaine was joined in her criticism by Admiral George Varma, who spoke out against the rise of commercial influence in Alliance military matters.^[38]^

Sirius Corp's integration with the Alliance took another step forward on January 14, 3308, with Mahon granting permission for the mega corporation to establish a presence in Alliance space. Four Sirius Megaships arrived in Alioth, Arimpox, Di Jian, and Reorte, and Sirius advisors officially joined the ADF and multiple government departments to streamline ADF and Sirius Navy joint operations. This provoked fresh disapproval from Councillor Kaine, who argued that Mahon's executive action was illegal and Assembly approval was needed to invite Sirius Corp into Alliance systems. Kaine also complained that Mahon's decision could not be reversed in court as it was tied to the defence pact and thus protected as a classified military matter.^[39]^ The Reorte Mining Coalition, the ruling faction of Reorte, concurred with Kaine. On January 24, CEO Fergus Cassidy had the Sirius Megaship Chariot of Rhea blockaded and ordered it to vacate the system, a development that threatened to stall broad acceptance of the pact.^[40]^ Sirius Corp refused to move the Chariot of Rhea, and on January 27, Reorte Mining Coalition forces attacked, claiming they were acting to remove an illegal foreign entity, and they ignored Prime Minister Mahon's orders to stand down. Captain Delfina Dominguez, commander of the Chariot of Rhea, warned that her own forces would defend Sirius assets.^[41]^ The Reorte Mining Coalition struck a decisive blow, and on February 3, Captain Dominguez announced that Sirius Corporation would withdraw from Reorte and the Chariot of Rhea would evacuate to Leesti pending discussions with Allied leaders. The crisis prompted a series of emergency meetings of the Alliance Assembly, and Reorte's representative, Councillor Ainsley Niven, upbraided Mahon for trying to implement the defence pact without seeking the approval of Alliance members.^[42]^ In response to the incident, Li Yong-Rui sought reassurances from the Alliance that his employees would not be attacked again, explaining that he had a responsibility to protect his subordinates from any client hostility. On February 8, Mahon gave the CEO his personal guarantee that the Reorte conflict would not be repeated, and noted that Sirius Corporation forces had been welcomed in Alioth, Arimpox, and Di Jian.^[43]^

The Reorte debacle led to the Assembly censuring Mahon on February 25, 3308 for "disregarding the Alliance's principles by unilaterally forcing cooperation with Sirius Corporation". Councillor Kaine called for the strategic defence pact to be reclassified as civil legislation rather than a military contract, and demanded that Li Yong-Rui either accept these new terms or sever the pact and withdraw Sirius Corporation assets from Alioth, Arimpox, Di Jian, and Leesti.^[44]^ Yong-Rui appeared before the Assembly on March 9, 3308 to negotiate a compromise: allow a trial period for Sirius to prove its worth to the Alliance, and then decide whether or not to continue the pact. This offer was accepted and the trial period was set for three months, but Councillor Niven warned that this might not be enough to win over some Alliance members.^[45]^

## Lore

**The Sirius Corporation – The First of the Mega-corporations**^[3]^

In GalNet’s series relating key points in human history, popular historian Sima Kalhana addresses the rise of the first mega-corporation.^[3]^

Apart from a few isolated backwater systems, the presence of mega-corporations is ubiquitous throughout civilised space. Massive as many of these organisations are, none of them compare to the wealth and influence of the Sirius Corporation.^[3]^

The rise of the largest corporation in history started in 2339 when the Sirius Corporation launched the first completely corporate colonial mission arrived in the Sirius star system. The continual state of conflict between the Federation and the Empire catapulted the Sirius Corporation into an economic powerhouse as they became the lead supplier of fuel, then later drives and other technologies.^[3]^

Within a century, its products were integrated into military and civilian production. It also developed an envied trusted status with both superpowers and indeed supplied both sides during their conflicts. This in part was due to strict information restriction protocols and an open promise that it would favour neither side during any conflict.^[3]^

The Sirius Corporation developed its own code of strict laws to ensure fair dealing as well as the good governance of its workforce. Its influence reached such a state that the so-called ‘Sirius Convention’ was applied not just during deals with the corporation, but between independent systems as well.^[3]^

Throughout the years, fuel and drive production has remained their core business, although judicious expansion into other markets has driven its astronomical growth. The Sirius Corporation now operates several product-oriented divisions including: Sirius Catering, Sirius Mining, Sirius Power, Sirius Luxury Transports, Sirius Industrial and Sirius Atmospherics. Most recently they launched a new venture, Sirius Gov, to provide governmental services for population management on all scales.^[3]^

Its history has been marked with some failures, most notable of which is the Antares incident which I will examine in the next article. However, its successes have far exceeded those failures and the Sirius Corporation remains the most powerful corporation in known space.^[3]^

## Sirius Subsidiaries

The Sirius Corporation has a great many subsidiaries, but its main business centres around fusion reactors of all sorts - it makes and sells hyperdrive fuels, hyperdrives, power plants large and small, luxury surface transports, waste processing reactors, atmospheric processing units, industrial facilities for smelting, refining, and a wide range of mining equipment. It has cemented its position by using standardised parts for its power plants - whether it is at the heart of an industrial smelter, a luxury highliner or a surface city.^[46]^

The Sirius Corporation now runs several dozen systems. These have a strict legal system, their own penal code (based on Federal law), and their own law enforcement. They even have their own navy.^[46]^

Sirius Corporation subsidiary minor factions include:

| Subsidiary | Home System |
| --- | --- |
| Sirius Atmospherics | Mons |
| Sirius Catering | Phanes |
| Sirius Drives | Song Ku |
| Sirius Hot2Cold | Ross 591 |
| Sirius Hyperspace | Ngalia |
| Sirius Industrial | Holler |
| Sirius Luxury Transports | Xi Shan |
| Sirius Mining | Raurt |
| Sirius Mining Merope | Merope |
| Sirius Power | Kikapu |

### Sirius Industrial

Sirius Industrial, based in the Holler system, makes a broad range of bespoke heavy industrial installations for smelting, refining, processing and manufacturing. There are largely automated and easily assembled on site, using local materials for key elements of the construction where possible. All are centred around large Sirius power reactors - often multiple 100GW units are used in a single plant.^[47]^

### Sirius Atmospherics

Sirius Atmospherics is based on the Mons system. Early terraforming tended to use genetically engineered biological processes that would change the atmosphere of a suitable world over many decades to a breathable atmosphere using energy captured from the star via biological processes. This process was both slow, expensive (it was made up of many stages) and only a narrow set of worlds were suitable. The idea of doing direct chemical conversion on a vast scale was there, but not practical because of the vast power requirements.^[48]^

In late 3306, Sirius Atmospherics partnered with the Alliance to organize an expedition to colonize the Coalsack Nebula.^[49]^ Shortly after the establishment of permanent colonies in the region, Dr. Maximilian North of Sirius Atmospherics announced the development of new terraforming procedures tailored to Ammonia Worlds, which had previously been disregarded as terraforming targets and had only been of interest to the Thargoids.^[50]^^[51]^ Dr. North's subsequent report that the terraforming procedures were proving to be less effective than anticipated stoked speculation from observers such as Flint Lafosse that the project was only a cover story for other Sirius activities in the Coalsack.^[52]^

### Sirius Navy

    - *Main article: Sirius Navy*

The Sirius Navy is a large organisation, providing vigorous protection for all Sirius Corporation interests. It owns its own cruisers built by Imperial Gutamaya yards, and built under license in Sirius' own naval yards, branded in the Sirius Corporation's own royal blue livery, but much of their naval force comes from a large number of Cutters built under license and by Imperial Gutamaya, operating as patrol ships, and a great many fighters.^[53]^

Beginning on January 10, 3308, in accordance with a strategic defence pact approved by the Alliance, the Sirius Navy assumed responsibility for assisting the Alliance Defence Force in anti-Thargoid operations, and a Sirius Navy representative was granted a seat on the Alliance's Council of Admirals.^[38]^

## The Sirius Convention

The Sirius Corporation operated under its own strict laws, governing workers rights, privileges etc., and also put in place conventions whereby in dealings with customers for large projects it voluntarily operated under a special hybrid of local law and Sirius law - where the strictest provision was deemed to be in place. This became known as 'The Sirius Convention' - and was often applied in treaties between independent systems.^[54]^

The Sirius Corporation developed a strong reputation for fair dealing too. It would never refer to rival jurisdictions or deal terms in a negotiation with a government, and would keep such negotiations strictly to the scope of the deal - not using any of the many levers less scrupulous organisations would frequently call upon. Such deals were said to be conducted 'under the Sirius Rule' - another term that effectively entered the language, much like the 'Chatham House Rule' a millennium earlier.^[54]^

### Other

- Highliner Antares - An experimental passenger liner that went missing during its maiden flight in 3251.^[59]^ Some of its wreckage was recovered in 3301, and it was officially determined that the ship's loss had been caused by a hyperdrive malfunction, but the deaths of Federal Vice President Nigel Smeaton, Federal Security Service agent Susan Monroe, and Federal Times reporter Elaine Boyd are thought to have been a coordinated scheme to deter a deeper investigation.

## Locations

### Core Systems

Sirius Corporation maintains an extensive presence throughout the Core Systems, and especially in a cluster of systems around Sirius, its permit-locked headquarters. CEO Li Yong-Rui also bases his Powerplay operation in Lembava, but this system does not fall directly under Sirius Corp control.

- **Sirius**
- Avik
- Luhman 16
- Luyten 674-15
- Luyten's Star
- Mildeptu
- Procyon

### Sirius Colonies

Beginning in March 3301, Sirius Corporation established a network of colonies and support outposts stretching beyond the Core Systems.^[5]^ While Sirius still maintains a presence in most of these systems, a number of the stations have since fallen under the control of other minor factions. Also, one system that Sirius Corporation had slated for colonization, Wredguia SX-L d7-92, was inexplicably never colonized despite the presence of two natural Earth-like worlds.

On March 22, 3304, Sirius Corp announced that their presence in Sothis and Ceos would be expanded with new Starports, Settlements, and Megaships.^[60]^ On April 5, 3304, Sirius completed 15 new orbital and planetary starports and multiple Bulk Cruiser Megaships (Aquarius Class Tanker KTF-895, Demeter Class Bulk Cargo Ship HXO-889, Dionysus Class Agricultural Vessel GTP-8846, Freedom Class Survey Vessel MRM-629, Gordon Class Bulk Cargo Ship QLR-562, Hercules Class Bulk Cargo Ship KAS-093, Naphtha Class Tanker HTH-082, and Sagan Class Tourist Ship VOY-438) distributed throughout its colonies. Sothis, Ceos, Robigo, and HIP 8396 each gained three new ports, Takurua gained two, and Almagest gained one.

## Timeline

14 MAR 3308

- The Reorte Mining Coalition wants to cut ties with the Alliance in protest against the military defence pact with Sirius Corporation. Vox Galactica featured an announcement from the faction's CEO, Fergus Cassidy: "The pact's three-month probationary period is clearly a ruse. It is designed to allow time for Sirius agents to bribe, convince or threaten Allied decision-makers into accepting Li Yong-Rui's presence. We'd rather become an independent faction than allow this greedy and untrustworthy company into Reorte space." Councillor Ainsley Niven, who represents Reorte, told the Assembly: "Obviously I have argued against this extreme move, but I cannot ignore the strength of feeling from the system's governing faction. For Reorte Mining Coalition leaders, leaving the Alliance is less risky than allowing Sirius Corporation to become embedded in the system's infrastructure." Vanya Driscoll, political correspondent for The Alliance Tribune, reported: "There are already wild rumours that this situation might spark mass declarations of independence, similar to the Federation's secession crisis last year. But there is no indication as yet that these events will play out quite so dramatically. What is certain, however, is how damaging this is for Prime Minister Mahon's campaign to promote acceptance of Sirius Corporation. A historically significant system such as Reorte withdrawing from the Alliance would likely sour the megacorp's reputation with those it seeks to impress."^[61]^

09 MAR 3308

- The Alliance and Sirius Corporation have negotiated a three-month probationary period for its proposed anti-xeno defence agreement. In response to a summons by Councillor Nakato Kaine, CEO Li Yong-Rui appeared in person before the Assembly. As part of a longer speech he stated: "I fully understand that, in order to be effective, the strategic defence pact requires broader political support. But to share its details before the Alliance can experience its benefits may lead to hasty decisions. Instead, we propose that Sirius Corporation is provided with an opportunity to demonstrate how we can enhance Allied security against the Thargoids. At the end of a contractually defined period of time, the Assembly can review the pact and decide whether or not to continue with our partnership." Following further discussions, Yong-Rui accepted that the probationary period would be reduced to three months from the originally suggested six. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon expressed his gratitude that a solution had been reached. Councillor Ainsley Niven, representing the Reorte system, sounded a cautionary note: "Frankly, some Allied factions won't tolerate Sirius's presence for three minutes let alone three months. I fear that this will not be enough to convince all of our member systems to cooperate."^[45]^

25 FEB 3308

- The Alliance Assembly has delivered an official rebuke to its prime minister following the recent skirmish in the Reorte system. There have been heated debates following the conflict between Reorte Mining Coalition and Sirius Corporation. This was triggered by the megacorp's unpopular attempt to establish a presence in the system as an anti-xeno defence partner. Councillor Nakato Kaine led a motion to censure against Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, which successfully passed with a plurality of votes after some abstentions. The strongly-worded reprimand focused on 'disregarding the Alliance's principles by unilaterally forcing cooperation with Sirius Corporation'. After Mahon formally accepted the reprimand, Councillor Kaine addressed the Assembly: "This body does not have the right to govern its member systems without their consent. The strategic defence pact must become civil legislation rather than a military contract, so it can be passed as law. I call upon Li Yong-Rui to agree to these terms, or else to abandon the pact and remove Sirius Corporation's forces from the Alioth, Arimpox, Di Jian and Leesti systems."^[44]^

08 FEB 3308

- The recent battle in the Reorte system has caused Sirius Corporation to question the terms of its partnership with the Alliance. The Alliance Tribune's political correspondent Vanya Driscoll reported: "When Sirius Corporation megaships arrived in four Allied systems, it's fair to assume they anticipated a degree of public resistance. But being directly attacked by the Reorte Mining Coalition clearly wasn't part of their risk assessment. Li Yong-Rui has urgently sought assurances from the Alliance that such conflicts will not happen again. The megacorp's CEO claimed that he has a duty to protect his employees from aggression by their own clients. In response, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon personally guaranteed that this unfortunate incident was a one-off, stressing that Sirius personnel have been welcomed in the Alioth, Arimpox and Di Jian systems. He added that the Alliance Defence Force is working closely with Admiral Nikolas Glass, the Sirius Navy's representative. But others in the Assembly are now openly questioning the wisdom of the strategic defence pact. Although Councillor Nakato Kaine's opposition to Mahon is often viewed as predictable, more members now agree with her that many Allied factions will reject the assertion that Sirius Corporation is an ally to be trusted."^[43]^

03 FEB 3308

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
The Reorte Mining Coalition has succeeded in forcing Sirius Corporation to withdraw from the Reorte system. Despite the megacorp's strategic defence pact with the Alliance, Reorte's controlling faction claimed the Sirius megaship Chariot of Rhea was an illegal intruder. This resulted in open conflict, which has ended with Sirius Corporation's defeat. Fergus Cassidy, CEO of the Reorte Mining Coalition, transmitted this message: "With the support of many brave pilots, we have prevented Sirius from sinking its claws into the Reorte system. I hope our victory will convince the Alliance's leaders to think twice about their deal with the devil." Captain Delfina Dominguez has confirmed that Sirius Corporation has started to withdraw from Reorte. The megaship Chariot of Rhea will leave Reorte and jump to the Leesti system pending further discussions with Allied leaders. Sources have confirmed that permits to the Alioth and Sirius systems have been allocated to independent pilots depending on the faction they supported during the conflict. The Assembly has held emergency meetings to debate this turn of events. Councillor Ainsley Niven, who represents the Reorte system, delivered a warning to Prime Minister Mahon: "You have invited Sirius Corporation to provide military aid against the Thargoids, but without seeking the approval of those we are pledged to protect. That is not the way of the Alliance, no matter how grave the threat."^[42]^

The Reorte Mining Coalition has declared its intent to remove the Sirius Corporation presence from its home system. The megaship Chariot of Rhea arrived in Reorte as part of Sirius Corporation's new role as the Alliance's strategic defence partner. But the system's controlling faction ordered it to withdraw. The megaship's non-compliance has resulted in skirmishes targeting Sirius forces. Fergus Cassidy, CEO of the Reorte Mining Coalition, announced: "We fully support Councillor Kaine's position that Sirius Corporation is operating illegally under Alliance law. Therefore, we will defend our territory from this aggressive foreign entity." A response was broadcast by Captain Delfina Dominguez of the Sirius Navy, who commands the Chariot of Rhea: "Our presence is authorised by the military contract between Sirius Corporation and the Alliance Defence Force. If local forces continue to attack, we will have no option but to defend our assets." The fighting is not believed to have reached surface level and is expected to remain a ship-based conflict. To rally support from independent pilots, both factions are offering access to permit-locked systems. Reorte Mining Coalition will sponsor distribution of an Alioth system permit, while Sirius Corporation will authorise a permit to the Sirius system. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has ordered the Reorte Mining Coalition to cease hostilities immediately. However, Councillor Ainsley Niven – who represents Reorte in the Assembly and is a political supporter of Nakato Kaine – claims that the faction has the right to protect its territory, since it was not invited to ratify the defence pact.^[41]^

24 JAN 3308

- The presence of Sirius Corporation in the Reorte system at the Alliance's invitation has been challenged by the controlling faction. In its new role as a strategic defence partner, Sirius Corporation recently established itself in several Alliance systems. But its megaship in Reorte, Chariot of Rhea, has found itself blockaded by system security and refused permission to offload cargo or personnel. A broadcast was made by Fergus Cassidy, CEO of the Reorte Mining Coalition: "Councillor Kaine is right to say that Sirius is acting illegally. The prime minister did not consult us or any other Allied faction on working with them, and there's good reason to be sceptical of their motives. We regard the Chariot of Rhea as an intruder and insist that it leaves immediately." Li Yong-Rui has assured Alliance leaders that Sirius Corporation will only be collaborating on anti-Thargoid defence projects. He stressed that there will be no disruption to any local civil or commercial activity. The Alliance Tribune commented on the situation: "Many Allied systems welcomed the news that our military is being bolstered by Sirius Corporation. But others expressed disapproval, particularly among the Old Worlds where the populations tend to be more sceptical of change. What happens in Reorte could determine whether or not the new defence pact becomes widely accepted."^[40]^

14 JAN 3308

- Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has invited Sirius Corporation to establish a permanent presence within the Alliance. The Alliance Tribune's political correspondent Vanya Driscoll reported: "Sirius Corporation's new role as a strategic defence partner has expanded swiftly, with a Sirius faction established in the Alioth system to represent the megacorp. In addition, several megaships have arrived in other Allied systems to provide support. The Alliance Defence Force and some government departments now have official advisors from Sirius Corporation on their staff. Prime Minister Mahon announced that these developments will streamline joint operations with the Sirius Navy, and in turn provide effective countermeasures against Thargoid aggression. But Councillor Nakato Kaine claims that the presence of Sirius Gov is illegal as it was not ratified by the Assembly. She has pointed out that since the defence pact makes this a classified military matter, any civil action to reverse Mahon's executive decision has been deliberately blocked."^[39]^

10 JAN 3308

- A new member has been appointed to the Council of Admirals to represent Sirius Corporation as the Alliance's strategic defence partner. Political correspondent Vanya Driscoll reported for The Alliance Tribune: "There are always six seats on the Council of Admirals, taken by senior military commanders from the largest regional fleets. Not only is this the first time that a seventh position has been created, it's also the first to come from outside the Alliance. The new addition is Admiral Nikolas Glass, a highly decorated officer with the Sirius Navy. His new role is to coordinate the Alliance's anti-Thargoid operations, which from now on will be directly supported by Sirius Corporation. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Fleet Admiral Hayley Sorokin both endorsed this development as a way of strengthening the Alliance Defence Force, which lacks the might of the Federal or Imperial Navy. Many member systems have demanded increased protection against the Thargoid threat, so this news is likely to be well received. As expected, Councillor Nakato Kaine opposed the defence pact, with Admiral George Varma also critical of 'merging commercial interests with military matters'. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran also admitted that she abstained during the recent joint vote, but chose not to elaborate on her reasons. So it seems that the Assembly is not fully confident about this union with Sirius Corporation."^[38]^

03 JAN 3308

- Sirius Corporation has signed an agreement to provide the Alliance with ships, materials and personnel to help combat the Thargoids. The Alliance Assembly and the Council of Admirals held a rare joint vote on the issue of inviting the megacorp to become a strategic defence partner. The motion was debated in private and reportedly passed by a slim majority. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon told The Alliance Tribune: "The danger posed by the Thargoids is increasing once more, perhaps accelerated by the loss of Aegis and a lack of any binding treaty between the superpowers. It is vital that we make a proactive decision to maintain security for Alliance systems. Sirius Corporation will work closely with the Alliance Defence Force to reinforce our member vessels, focusing exclusively on anti-xeno operations. In return, new commercial agreements will provide the company with increased access to certain financial endeavours." Councillor Nakato Kaine spoke on behalf of several disapproving members of the Assembly: "We are already too entwined with this ruthless corporate giant, so to hand our defences over to them is another blow to the Alliance's identity. It is also convenient that the details of the pact remain classified under military restrictions. We don't even know what price we're paying to hire Sirius to be our guard dog."^[37]^

28 DEC 3307

- The noted historian Sima Kalhana takes a look back at the turbulent events of the last year in a four-part series of articles.
"The start of 3307 was a time of crisis. The rise of the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army (NMLA), the Marlinist refugee crisis and increased Empire-Federation tensions had brought a full-scale superpower war closer, with renewed attacks from the Thargoids increasing the pressure. All of this led to Pranav Antal's proposal of a diplomatic conference for all three superpower governments to work through their problems – the very first Galactic Summit. Within weeks, Sirius Corporation was selected as the neutral host for the conference. Li Yong-Rui scored another triumph by establishing the Marlinist Colonies for millions of political refugees who had fled from the Empire. In February came the trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent, accused of arranging Starship One's destruction back in 3301. His paymaster was revealed as Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester, who wanted to replace Federal democracy with direct corporate rule. His breakaway faction Jupiter Division was defeated in battle and Rochester himself jailed for life. This also led to Core Dynamics's acquisition of Lakon Spaceways being cancelled, leaving the Alliance to purchase a majority sharehold in the company. Key players on the political stage finally gathered when the Galactic Summit began in late February. The Sirius system hosted leaders from the Alliance, Empire, Federation and independent systems. Even pirate warlord Archon Delaine gatecrashed the event, causing controversy with his 'crown of bones' speech. It seemed for a while that the bickering between so many strong personalities might trigger a war rather than avert one. But gradually there was progress, with the possibility of a treaty to increase unity against the Thargoid threat. But before reaching this conclusion, the Galactic Summit was derailed by a threat from another source. Nine Martyrs – as named by the NMLA leader Theta Seven – was the largest terrorist attack in history. Hundreds of thousands were killed by starport bombings in nine systems, including the superpower capitals of Alioth, Achenar and Sol. This horrific tragedy ended the conference abruptly, but did give rise to some inter-power cooperation. A new agreement signed at the Galactic Summit allowed the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit (ACT) to be formed rapidly. Drawing on the superpowers' security services and other organisations, its sole purpose was to hunt down and eliminate the NMLA, a task that would dominate the headlines for the rest of the year."^[62]^

22 DEC 3307

- The Alliance Assembly has invited Sirius Corporation to collaborate on enhancing protection for member systems against the Thargoids. Political journalist Vanya Driscoll reported on the development for The Alliance Tribune: "Sirius Corporation has been a key partner in the Alliance's expansion programme. Most notably, its subsidiary Sirius Atmospherics helped establish colonies in the Coalsack Nebula to support meta-alloy harvesting. But according to insiders, the suspension of Aegis and the increasing Thargoid presence has raised fears that Alliance systems may be vulnerable to xeno invasion. This has led to Prime Minister Edmund Mahon suggesting a strategic defence contract with the megacorp. In response, CEO Li Yong-Rui himself has travelled to the Alioth system. It's understood that high-level discussions are taking place on ways in which the company might augment the Alliance Defence Force's capabilities. Councillor Nakato Kaine, Mahon's political rival, has repeated her claim that Sirius Corporation has a disturbing amount of influence over some council members. She fears that private agreements are being made behind closed doors, and has called for increased transparency."^[63]^^[36]^

17 DEC 3307

- The recent counterstrike against the Thargoids has revealed that Salvation is being unofficially supported by trained military personnel. Commodore Morag Halloran was a senior officer with the Alliance Defence Force who is now working for Salvation. She sent this statement to the media: "Over the last few years, I have fought hard to protect Allied interests from the Thargoids. But every battle against them felt like a defensive measure, a holding action. I'm convinced that these creatures are more than capable of wiping us all out. When an entire Thargoid fleet was forced out of the Cornsar system in September, I approached the Council of Admirals about sending ships to help, but my proposal was rejected. Then Salvation contacted me directly, saying that he required military leadership and my experiences in the Coalsack Nebula made me an ideal candidate. Along with Lieutenant Commander Glynn and nearly a hundred crewmates, we resigned our commissions and headed for Hind Mine. I now command many others who were recruited from the Federal, Imperial and Sirius Navies to serve on the Taurus megaships and elsewhere. I'm aware that some will view my actions as dereliction of duty, but I believe our true duty is to stop the Thargoids at any cost. And as our recent success proves, only Salvation has the means of doing so." The Alliance Assembly, Federal Congress and Imperial Senate have all acknowledged the loss of some military personnel to Salvation's cause. While efforts are being made to prevent further losses, it is rumoured that potential concessions include official support for Salvation's anti-xeno activities.^[64]^

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Onionhead gamma strain is now available in selected industrial anarchy systems. Following the Kumo Council's initiative, enough product was manufactured to supply approximately 10% of all industrial-based markets controlled by anarchic factions. Unlike previous versions of onionhead, this variant is not listed as a rare commodity. Adalyn Cross, a journalist for Vox Galactica, reported: "Onionhead gamma strain is being marketed to the public for medicinal use, but most customers are under no illusions regarding its real benefits. The Coalition for Legalisation claims that it is 'no more harmful or addictive than alcohol or coffee, with potential psychological and palliative benefits'. This has not prevented many authorities, especially in the Federation, from demanding that it remain universally outlawed. It is currently illegal in all but anarchy jurisdictions. There are serious concerns that it may act as a gateway drug to more harmful substances. Security services are also unhappy about the extra revenue flowing into Archon Delaine's coffers. Some logistics experts noted that onionhead gamma strain was distributed with surprising speed. It is already being reported as available from the following systems: Alici, Baraswar, Kishpakho, Nastrond and Nocori. It's been suggested that Sirius Corporation is secretly ferrying shipments of the drug via its freight transportation network, and is part of the deal between the Kumo Crew and the Blue Viper Club. Sinclair Faraldo, VP of Corporate Marketing, rejected this claim as 'absurd and libellous'."^[35]^

25 JUN 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Two Alliance stations have been constructed following a successful re-election campaign by Prime Minister Edmund Mahon. Enterprise Market in the LHS 2522 system and Prosperity Core in the Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19 system are now fully operational. Prime Minister Mahon welcomed visitors to the new starports, promising that they would "further enhance the Alliance's commitment to creating opportunities". However, Councillor Nakato Kaine triggered heated debate in the Alliance Assembly when she made this announcement: "My investigation turned up irregularities in the tritium mining campaign, suggesting that it only received enough deliveries to allow one starport to be built. Furthermore, docking records seem to indicate that Sirius Corporation made up the shortfall with a number of unregistered donations. Sirius Corporation now has a presence in the Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19 system. This suggests disturbing parallels with the company's recent dealings to help build Archon Delaine's new starports. The question is – what did Mahon promise in return?" A statement from the Office of the Prime Minister clarified that Sirius Corporation was one of many companies currently partnered with the Alliance to support its expansion programme. It did not address the discrepancy in tritium deliveries or refer to any contributions from the megacorp.^[34]^

Pilots have delivered commodities to enable Sirius Corporation to mass produce a fully engineered detailed surface scanner. The enhanced ship module will shortly receive a commercial release, having previously only been available during a terraforming initiative by Sirius Atmospherics in late 3306. The Engineered Detailed Surface Scanner V1 increases probe coverage to twice the normally achievable range, offering a more efficient mapping of planetary surfaces. The project's success was declared by Sinclair Faraldo, marketing director for Sirius Corporation: "We are most grateful to all pilots who brought us shipments of CMM composites, muon imagers and synthetic reagents as requested. Mass production of the enhanced detailed surface scanner has already begun, and it will be available for purchase from human technology brokers very soon." All pilots who took part in this campaign can now collect payment from Sirius Corporation at Ashby City in the Luyten's Star system.^[33]^

Sirius Corporation has requested commodities to make a fully engineered detailed surface scanner commercially available. The ship module was produced in limited numbers during a terraforming programme campaign by Sirius Atmospherics in late 3306. It was awarded to pilots who provided data on worlds with ammonia-based atmospheres for its terraforming programme. Sinclair Faraldo, marketing director for Sirius Corporation, provided details: "Following a feasibility study, we have determined that this module can be economically mass produced for general sale. Our fully engineered detailed surface scanner has twice probe coverage, allowing planets and moons to be mapped more efficiently. In order to begin production, we require large quantities of CMM composites, muon imagers and synthetic reagents. We will generously reward pilots who can deliver these to Ashby City in the Luyten's Star system." The Engineered Detailed Surface Scanner V1 will be available for purchase at all human technology brokers, assuming that sufficient quantities of commodities can be obtained.^[32]^

15 JUN 3307

- The galaxy's largest megacorporation is continuing to influence the political arena and affect billions of lives. A review was published by Marlon Royce, business analyst for Vox Galactica: "With its own government, laws and naval fleet, it's not surprising that Sirius Corporation is occasionally referred to as 'the fourth superpower'. That now seems to be its actual goal, as its impact upon interstellar politics increases. When Sirius Corporation resettled the Marlinist refugees in their own colony systems, it averted war between the Empire and the Federation. But this seemingly altruistic move enabled CEO Li Yong-Rui to claim political neutrality, gaining public support to host the Galactic Summit in the Sirius system. That success was undermined by the controversy of granting diplomatic status to pirate warlord Archon Delaine. Rumours of secret business dealings were reinforced when Sirius subsidiaries appeared alongside the Kumo Crew's new starports. High-level agreements were also made with the Alliance, with Sirius Atmospherics aiding colonisation of the Coalsack Nebula. But some believe that its project to terraform ammonia worlds brought retaliatory strikes from the Thargoids and enormous casualties. The latest news is of a collaboration with technology brokers to make a previously limited ship module commercially available. Is this a shrewd business decision, or part of Sirius Corporation's strategy of political dominance?"^[4]^

30 APR 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Five new starports constructed by Archon Delaine's recent campaign have now become fully operational. The Orbis stations, which are run by the Kumo Council faction, are listed below:
Kumo City in the Pegasi sector PN-T C3-14 system (Harma region)
California Freeport in the HIP 18390 system (California Nebula)
Crimson Exchange in the HIP 10792 system (Sothis region)
Fort Xeno in the HIP 62154 system (Coalsack Nebula)
Delaine Terminus in the Eol Prou PC-K c9-91 system (Colonia region)
The starports will provide a full range of services, although their low populations bring concerns that they may be under-staffed. Additionally, security agencies in nearby systems expressed fears that since they are operated by the Kumo Crew syndicate, they are likely to harbour black markets and promote illegal activity. Arch-Corsair Kay Volantyne, a senior member of the Kumo Council, addressed this when she told The Pegasi Sentinel: "These starports exist solely to encourage trade, which is the lifeblood of our galaxy. Sometimes a little lifeblood can get spilled here and there, so I'm sure our new neighbours will welcome our protection, yes?" Other factions have appeared in the five systems, including subsidiaries of Sirius Corporation. Several newsfeeds have speculated about an ambiguous connection between the syndicate and the megacorp, whose financial support might explain how the Kumo Crew managed to extend so far beyond its territory.^[65]^

11 MAR 3307

- The conference in the Sirius system has ended prematurely after terrorist bombings against nine starports across the Alliance, Empire and Federation. Sirius Corporation confirmed that the cancellation was due to fears that Patterson Enterprise station may be the next target. All scheduled business, including finalising the Sirius Treaty, has been halted. The delegations are returning to their home systems under high security. Temporary permits for the Sirius system will remain in place for one week. Pilots who contributed to the security and trade initiatives held in partnership with the Empire can collect their rewards at the Spirit of Laelaps. Core Dynamics, Gutamaya and Lakon Spaceways will continue to offer a 10% discount on all their ships for one more week. The Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army has claimed responsibility for the simultaneous attacks in nine systems, including superpower capitals Achenar, Alioth and Sol. The following message was broadcast on NMLA propaganda channels: "I no longer have a name. Nor a family. Nor a future. Each taken by the Empire. Now all I have is the dehumanising number printed on my uniform in their torture chambers. Now all I am is Theta Seven. The Alliance and Federation's rulers have revealed themselves as imperialist supporters of the Duval dynasty, which has crushed our ideals for a thousand years. Peoples of the galaxy – you can change this. We give you your own Nine Martyrs. Use them to retake control and regain your power." Media newsfeeds are detailing the impact and implications of the attacks. There is speculation that NMLA activists were concealed among Marlinist refugees that fled to Alliance and Federation space to escape Imperial persecution. The Marlinist Parliament has officially stated it has "no connection to Neo-Marlinist extremists", and that it will cooperate with security and emergency services during this crisis.^[31]^

08 MAR 3307

- At the Galactic Summit, the infamous pirate leader Archon Delaine has demanded to be accepted as the legitimate leader of a political power. A gap in the schedule allowed him to make an address in the main conference chamber: "Most of you see me as a common criminal, rather than the rightful ruler of multiple systems. That must end now! My efforts to build a Kumo nation deserve respect. I am here to declare my sovereignty and take my rightful place on the political stage." This was immediately dismissed by many delegations. Princess Aisling Duval said this was a barbaric mockery of nobility, while Shadow President Winters asked how much bloodshed the pirates had caused to obtain their power. Archon Delaine replied: "Are you all so innocent, then? Every civilisation begins with barbarism, and maintains authority with the threat of violence. None of you can say otherwise. We all wear a crown of bones." There followed intense debate as to whether the Kumo Crew's territory could be recognised as a new nation-state or was simply a rebranded crime syndicate. There is suspicion that some of the many criminal vessels detected in the Sirius system are from Delaine's pirate fleet. The Federal and Imperial delegations have offered to remove Archon Delaine's retinue, only to be reminded that Sirius Corporation has granted them full diplomatic immunity.^[66]^

04 MAR 3307

- Pirate warlord Archon Delaine has unexpectedly appeared at the diplomatic conference and demanded to participate as a political delegate. Delaine is the leader of the Kumo Crew, a notorious crime syndicate that controls dozens of systems. Their arrival at Patterson Enterprise station initially caused many delegations' security teams to begin evacuations. However, representatives of the Sirius Corporation called for calm and delivered this message: "We have vouchsafed Archon Delaine's presence and extended full diplomatic immunity to his retinue. As with all attendees, they are expected to abide by our rules and etiquettes." This reassurance did not prevent several ambassadors from walking out in protest. Some accused Sirius Corporation of striking a deal with Delaine to prevent even more pirate vessels from swarming through the Sirius system. Mainstream newsfeeds also covered the impact of Delaine's arrival.
The Imperial Herald: "Senator Patreus officially complained about 'the repulsive sight of pirate scum strolling alongside respectable politicians'. However, Chancellor Blaine agreed that Delaine could address the conference, albeit under close scrutiny."
The Federal Times: "Neither Hudson nor Winters have commented on Delaine's appearance, but the security chief for the Federal delegation remarked: 'One wrong step and we'll put some big holes right through their immunity.'"
The Alliance Tribune: "This is an unwelcome distraction from Prime Minister Mahon's proposal for Aegis's remit to be enormously expanded. The Sirius Treaty will fully unite superpowers, corporations and independent systems against the Thargoids – assuming that Mahon can convince his fellow leaders to agree."^[30]^

The Empire is aiding Sirius Corporation by offering bounty hunting and trade opportunities to support the Galactic Summit. The diplomatic conference is now entering its second week, with superpower and independent leaders gathered at Patterson Enterprise in the Sirius system. Sirius Corporation's CEO Li Yong-Rui announced: "Our thanks to the Federation for organising additional security against unexpected numbers of vessels this past week. Anarchic extremists, political enemies and opportunistic criminals all attempted to disrupt the conference to no avail. Pilots who helped maintain the peace can collect their rewards at the Spirit of Laelaps. For the coming week, we are working with the Empire to maintain the security operation by offering bounties on all wanted ships. The Empire will also pay generously for extra supplies of animal meat, coffee, fish, fruit and vegetables, and wine that are delivered to the Spirit of Laelaps." Pilots are reminded that neither permanent nor temporary permits to enter the Sirius system apply to fleet carriers. This joint initiative will run for one week, followed by Sirius Corporation partnering with the Alliance for the final week of the Galactic Summit. In related news, Core Dynamics, Gutamaya and Lakon Spaceways are continuing to offer a 10% discount on all their ships to mark the historic occasion.^[29]^

01 MAR 3307

- Delegates at the diplomatic conference have clashed over long-standing political issues, with some threatening to abandon the event. Journalists at Patterson Enterprise in the Sirius system reported their observations via mainstream newsfeeds.
The Imperial Herald: "Minister Whyte's claim that the Empire had fomented terrorism by repressing Marlinism was somewhat predictable. But nobody expected Princess Duval's icy retort, which caused shocked gasps across the chamber."
Sol Today: "President Hudson easily dealt with Patreus's whine about the Federation's so-called 'war-mongering', putting the bombastic Imp in his place."
Eye on Achenar: "The dull-witted thug of a president was no match for Senator Patreus, who received cheers for his condemnation of typical 'Fedneck' arrogance."
The Alliance Tribune: "The conference's hosts were visibly embarrassed by Councillor Kaine's claims that Coalsack Nebula terraforming projects had triggered recent Thargoid attacks. Shockingly, several delegates dismissed this as an internal matter for the Alliance."
The Federal Times: "Chancellor Blaine's stonewalling on the co-funding of humanitarian aid brought a rare flash of anger from Felicia Winters: 'Maybe the Emperor's puppet could loosen a few strings?'"
The Sovereign: "Despite Prime Minister Mahon exaggerating the benefits of Alliance membership, several independent ambassadors complained about its incomprehensible bureaucracy, saying it would be less damaging to declare war against the Alliance than join it."
A representative from Sirius Corporation reported that the Galactic Summit was "going well".^[67]^

The Federation is working with Sirius Corporation to offer bounty hunting opportunities to protect the diplomatic conference. The first Galactic Summit has officially opened at Patterson Enterprise station in the Sirius system. Temporary permits have been issued to all arriving delegates and Commanders for the three weeks of its term, although these do not apply to fleet carriers. Sirius Corporation's CEO Li Yong-Rui announced: "The data supplied to us in January revealed several unanticipated threats, putting additional strain on our navy and security forces. Working with the generous support of the Federation, we have placed bounties on all wanted ships to ensure delegates' safety. Pilots defending the Sirius system will be rewarded for handing in bounty vouchers at the Spirit of Laelaps." The joint initiative will run for one week, after which Sirius Corporation will partner with the Empire to provide for the needs and security of the conference. In related news, Core Dynamics, Gutamaya and Lakon Spaceways are celebrating the political gathering of all three superpowers with a 10% discount on their ships during the next three weeks. Delegations have begun to arrive and formal introductions are taking place, with much media attention. This is the first time that universally recognised figures such as President Zachary Hudson, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Princess Aisling Duval have been seen side by side.^[27]^

A wide range of luxurious food and drink for the Galactic Summit has been delivered to the Sirius Corporation. Orders were placed for Eden Apples Of Aerial, Ethgreze Tea Buds, Gerasian Gueuze Beer, Giant Irukama Snails, Goman Yaupon Coffee, Karsuki Locusts and Lavian Brandy. Large quantities of these rare items were shipped to Ashby City in the Luyten's Star system. The consumables will be ferried to the nearby Sirius system, where the diplomatic conference will take place. This initiative was considered a priority, since some delegates only agreed to attend if their requests for these rarities were met. CEO Li Yong-Rui has expressed his personal thanks to all pilots who delivered the rare goods, who can now collect their payment at Ashby City in the Luyten's Star system. Sirius Corporation has been organising the Galactic Summit for the past month, which has involved increased freight runs into its home system as well as heightened security. Preparations are now complete, and the first ambassadors from the Alliance, Empire and Federation are on their way.^[28]^

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Sirius Corporation has requested deliveries of consumables to Luyten's Star for the forthcoming diplomatic conference. The Galactic Summit will take place in the Sirius system and last for three weeks, beginning on Thursday the 25th of February. It will be attended by leaders from the Alliance, Empire and Federation, plus representatives from independent systems. Sirius Corporation has placed orders for these rare commodities: Eden Apples Of Aerial, Ethgreze Tea Buds, Gerasian Gueuze Beer, Giant Irukama Snails, Goman Yaupon Coffee, Karsuki Locusts and Lavian Brandy. All shipments are to be delivered to Ashby City in the Luyten's Star system. They will then be ferried to Sirius before the conference begins. CEO Li Yong-Rui discussed these preparations at a media event: "We will provide all honoured delegates with a comfortable, luxurious environment. This includes offering the finest cuisine from across the galaxy." Several journalists pointed out that both the Alliance and Empire had registered official complaints about the Galactic Summit's location being situated deep within Federal space. Li Yong-Rui responded: "I assure you that the Sirius system is politically neutral territory, and Sirius Corporation remains independent from the Federation. I can personally guarantee the safety and diplomatic immunity of all attendees."^[26]^

12 FEB 3307

- Delegations have been formed by the Empire and the Marlinist Colonies to take part in the forthcoming diplomatic conference. Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval will not attend in person, but will be directly represented by Chancellor Anders Blaine. During the conference, Senator Zemina Torval will temporarily assume chancellor duties and act as head of the Senate. In addition, Princess Aisling Duval and Senator Denton Patreus will be in attendance. They will be accompanied by experienced ambassadors from the Imperial Diplomatic Corps. The Marlinist Colonies have also finalised their delegation, which includes First Minister Jenna Fairfax and Minister Aaron Whyte. A spokesperson for the Marlinist Parliament said: "The Galactic Summit offers us an opportunity to engage with the Empire diplomatically, and we sincerely hope our voices will be heard. We also aim to establish mutually beneficial relations with other governments." There is widespread speculation on how the Empire will respond to political overtures from its own ex-citizens, who were persecuted for following the democratic ideology of Marlinism. However, most societies within the Marlinist Colonies still remain culturally Imperial in nature, despite their republican governance. The Galactic Summit is being hosted by Sirius Corporation and will officially commence on Thursday the 25th of February 3307.^[68]^

10 FEB 3307

- The acquisition of Lakon Spaceways by Core Dynamics has been revoked following revelations of illegal activity. An inquiry by the Independent Commission for Market Equality stated that former Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester "exerted unduly influence on Lakon shareholders, including bribery and blackmail". This led to new appointees to the board of directors, who were paid to approve the hostile takeover. The inquiry also factored in the recent Federal High Court trial, which proved that Jupiter Rochester was directly responsible for the destruction of Starship One in 3301. In both cases, he set up shell companies to move enormous funds via unregistered banking systems. Core Dynamics refused to comment on the allegations, but its legal team has terminated the transfer process. The entire corporation is currently in disarray due to several departments becoming an independent faction under the name Jupiter Division. At Lakon Spaceways, Trent Delaney and several other directors have resigned. During an emergency meeting, a majority of stakeholders approved reinstating Naomi Landseer as chairperson. With stock values plummeting and industry confidence low, the future of the company remains uncertain. However, Sirius Corporation confirmed that it has made preliminary offers with regards to acquiring Lakon as a subsidiary.^[69]^

Sirius Corporation has received more data than Utopia and will therefore host the Galactic Summit. Both organisations proposed to organise a diplomatic conference for the Alliance, Empire and Federation. After calling on the galactic community to gather data that would support security operations, many pilots handed in anomalous bulk scan data, atypical disrupted wake echoes, exceptional scrambled emission data and unusual encrypted files. All three superpower governments confirmed that due to its success in preparing effective security systems, they will accept Sirius Corporation as the neutral territory for the conference. CEO Li Yong-Rui made this announcement: "Thank you to all the independent pilots who supported us. Sirius will now begin work preparing for the first Galactic Summit, which we hope will increase peace and prosperity across the galaxy." Pilots who delivered to Sirius Corporation can collect their rewards from Goldstein Port in the Lembava system. Simguru Pranav Antal expressed disappointment, but confirmed that all who contributed to Utopia's initiative will be rewarded at Tanner Settlement in the Polevnic system. Sirius Corporation has stated that the Galactic Summit is provisionally scheduled to take place over a three-week period in late February and early March.^[25]^

Rival initiatives to arrange a diplomatic conference have been launched by Sirius Corporation and the Utopia commune. The Alliance Assembly, Federal Congress and Imperial Senate have each provisionally agreed to send delegates to the first tri-superpower Galactic Summit in late February. This political gathering will also be attended by representatives from independent systems. All parties have specified that their participation depends upon the event being successfully organised in neutral territory, and with sufficient resources and security in place. Sirius Corporation and Utopia have begun to gather supplies to host the conference. Both have requested assistance from the galactic community to provide a broad range of data, which will be vital for planning security operations. Whichever organisation obtains the greatest amount of data will be deemed most suitable. The following data sources are of interest to both parties: anomalous bulk scan data, atypical disrupted wake echoes, exceptional scrambled emission data and unusual encrypted files. Simguru Pranav Antal has called upon all pilots who support Utopia's proposal to deliver the data to Tanner Settlement in the Polevnic system. CEO Li Yong-Rui has asked all those who believe Sirius Corporation to be a more suitable host to deliver the data to Goldstein Port in the Lembava system.^[24]^

- Utopia's ability to host a diplomatic conference for all three superpowers has been challenged by the Sirius Corporation. The megacorp's counter-proposal was announced by CEO Li Yong-Rui: "With all due respect to Simguru Antal, his commune cannot match our level of resources. Sirius is far better placed in terms of logistics and security, and our navy will be able to ensure the safe transportation of all delegates. Furthermore, we already have excellent commercial relationships with the Alliance, Empire and Federation, and can therefore guarantee neutrality. Our recent philanthropic gesture at creating the Marlinist Colonies proves that we are an impartial, stabilising force for the whole galaxy." Discussions regarding the conference have been ongoing in superpower and independent systems alike. Some leaders have decried it as a pointless exercise, while others view it as a rare opportunity for political cohesion. Sirius Corporation and Utopia's propositions for a Galactic Summit are now being compared by potential attendees. However, Zachary Rackham's offer to host the conference at the actual galactic summit of Rackham's Peak is not being seriously considered.^[23]^

The newly settled Marlinist Colonies have asked for urgent deliveries of foodstuffs. Millions of Marlinists have relocated to eight systems colonised for them by the Sirius Corporation, thereby reducing tension between the Empire and the Federation. They have asked Universal Cartographics to delay a census of the systems' populations, while the refugees lay the infrastructure for their new societies. The Marlinist factions are holding democratic elections to select their leaders. However, the transitional parliament has declared an emergency due to the shortage of food stocks. Community spokesperson Dr Jenna Fairfax announced: "We are grateful to the galactic community and Sirius Corporation for providing homes. However, we need further help to feed our people in the short term, until we can become self-sufficient. The more supplies we can stockpile, the faster our economies will develop. This in turn will allow us to offer greater commodity discounts, to encourage the establishment of regular trade routes." Pilots are asked to deliver animal meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, and grain to Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550 system. As this system's defence forces are still being formed, the Free Marlinists of Carinae have offered bounties on all wanted ships to secure these initial trade runs to the Marlinist Colonies.^[22]^

- Sirius Atmospherics has delivered an update on its experiments to terraform ammonia worlds in the Coalsack Nebula. The subsidiary of Sirius Corporation is working closely with the Alliance to exploit the nebula's resources and pursue scientific investigation, including terraforming terrestrial planets with ammonia-based atmospheres. Project director Dr Maximilian North gave this progress report: "Preliminary efforts at ecosphere conversion have delivered promising results, but our new techniques are not as effective as the simulations based on exploration data suggested. We are still a long way from fully transforming these worlds into habitable environments." Independent journalist Flint 'Firemaker' Lafosse commented on this via the Rewired network: "Does anyone really believe Sirius is there for the terraforming? Of course they can't magically turn ammonia hellholes into paradise planets overnight! I know a cover story when I smell one. I wouldn't be surprised if they're deliberately trying to provoke the Thargoids for some reason, maybe to capture some specimens. Where there's xenos, there's credits." The Alliance has corroborated Dr North's report, but also confirmed an increase in Sirius Corporation personnel and equipment arriving in the Coalsack Nebula.^[70]^

21 DEC 3306

- As independent colonies are set up for Marlinist refugees, there has been a lull in terrorist strikes from the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army (NMLA). In recent months, the paramilitary group launched multiple attacks across the Empire. Starports and administrative buildings were bombed and dozens of individuals assassinated, including Prince Harold and more distant members of the Duval family. However, the number of incidents has fallen drastically following successful operations by the Imperial Internal Security Service: "After the Federal Security Service identified NMLA members aboard the emigrants' megaships, these were transferred to us for interrogation. We obtained information that enabled us to shut down many terrorist cells, although there is evidence that the NMLA's network remains widespread." In related news, hundreds of thousands of Marlinist refugees are preparing to occupy new colony systems established by the Sirius Corporation. Mass transportation will take place early next year, overseen by Safeguard Interstellar. The Empire, Federation and Sirius Gov have all agreed that the settlements will remain fully independent. The refugee population has already begun to determine its future social structure, based on the principles of Marlinism. A transitional parliament has been formed by community leaders such as Dr Jenna Fairfax, Aaron Whyte and Amrita Ross. Democratic elections for a representative government will take place once the Marlinist Colonies are operational.^[21]^

Sirius Corporation has successfully gathered materials to construct new independent settlements for Marlinist emigrants. Both the Empire and the Federation accepted the proposal from Sirius Corporation to establish colonies for the political refugees, who have been the cause of increased tension between the superpowers. CEO Li Yong-Rui made this announcement: "As always, the galactic community's immense contribution has made this achievement possible. The shipments of atmospheric processors, auto-fabricators, structural regulators and water purifiers will be used to construct new outposts and settlements in 8 uninhabited systems." The Omega Merchant Command is now offering rewards at Ellis Gateway in the Bd+05 1146 system to all pilots who delivered commodities. Aaron Whyte, a community leader among the refugees, commented on Vox Galactica: "I suppose we should be grateful that these colonies give us a chance of survival. But none of us wanted to set up our own kingdoms – only to remove the kings. And one day, we will." The Marlinist population is expected to be transferred from Federal space to the new colonies in early 3307.^[20]^

Commodities are requested to create new settlements for Marlinist refugees who fled from the Empire to the Federation.
Sirius Corporation has offered to resolve the current standoff between superpowers by establishing colonies where the refugees can live independently. Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corporation, summarised his proposal: "It is clear that the Marlinists cannot return to the Empire, and are a destabilising presence within the Federation. We offer an alternative by constructing permanent habitats for their population. These will be self-governed and may freely trade with the galactic community. Sirius cannot stand by while the risk of interstellar war increases. I sincerely hope this leads to a more stable and profitable period for us all." After intense debate, both Congress and the Senate accepted the proposal, with the proviso that any refugees identified as NMLA members will be returned to the Empire. Dr Jenna Fairfax, a Marlinist community leader, also offered her approval: "We were forced to abandon our entire lives because of our political beliefs. This at least gives us a chance to have homes again." Traders are asked to deliver atmospheric processors, auto-fabricators, structural regulators and water purifiers to Ellis Gateway in the Bd+05 1146 system. From there, the Omega Merchant Command will distribute resources for the colonisation of up to ten uninhabited systems.^[19]^

Explorers have catalogued many ammonia worlds for a Sirius Atmospherics terraforming project in the Coalsack Nebula.
The subsidiary of Sirius Corporation is one of several companies that are working in partnership with the Alliance to commercially exploit the region. Project director Dr Maximilian North announced the successful completion of the initiative: "The data provided on planets with ammonia-based atmospheres will be invaluable to our terraforming simulations. With our new environmental techniques, some of these poisonous worlds within the nebula may one day become habitable." Sirius Atmospherics has confirmed that payouts for all contributing pilots are now available at Betancourt Base in the Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 system. As the expansion into the Coalsack Nebula progresses, Commodore Morag Halloran of the Alliance Defence Force commented on the possibility of further attacks from the Thargoids: "Anti-xeno security is not as stringent as we had planned, due to the low availability of ADF vessels and Aegis being impacted by Federal and Imperial defunding. It may be necessary to call upon the galactic community again, should we encounter further interference from the Thargoids."^[71]^

Sirius Atmospherics has requested help from independent pilots to provide exploration data focusing on ammonia worlds for terraforming purposes. The subsidiary of Sirius Corporation is working in partnership with the Alliance to establish colonies within the Coalsack Nebula, and to identify sites of commercial and scientific interest. Dr Maximilian North, Sirius Atmospherics's project director, outlined the requirements: "We have developed revolutionary new terraforming procedures for terrestrial planets with ammonia-based atmospheres. Our collaboration with the Alliance is the perfect opportunity to try and put these to practical use, with the goal of transforming the region into a more human-friendly place. Sirius Atmospherics offers rewards for explorers who can provide us with exploration data. We are particularly interested in detailed scans focusing on the composition of ammonia worlds, not just in the Coalsack Nebula but elsewhere. Gathering wide-ranging data will enable us to determine the most suitable targets for environmental conversion." Pilots are requested to deliver exploration data to the Sirius Atmospherics research facility at Betancourt Base in the Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 system.^[72]^

09 NOV 3306

- Discoveries made two hundred years ago by an abandoned megaship have revealed untapped sources of meta-alloys within the Coalsack Nebula. The Adamastor, which was launched in 3111, returned to the Chukchan system from the Coalsack Nebula on autopilot with no traces of its crew. Thargoid barnacle sites were found in the nebula by independent pilots. The Alliance Assembly has announced an expedition to thoroughly explore the nebula, with the primary goal of securing fresh sources of meta-alloys. A press release stated: "Recent Thargoid activity in the Witch Head Nebula and over-exploitation of that region mean that this latest discovery has come at an opportune time. The Coalsack Nebula will now be the focus of an initiative to identify sites of commercial and scientific interest. To achieve this, we have established new partnerships with several corporations including Sirius Atmospherics. Although the mystery of the Adamastor may never be fully resolved, we hope it will leave a positive legacy for the people of the Alliance." Mention of corporate partnerships caused ripples in certain industries, with speculation that these have been in the pipeline for months. Political commentators also observed that 3307 will be an election year for the Alliance, placing pressure on Prime Minister Edmund Mahon to secure economic stability.^[49]^

30 NOV 3304

- Aegis has stationed a security force in the Meene system to protect the engineer Ram Tah. An announcement was made by Professor Alba Tesreau: "Ram Tah's research has been enormously beneficial to our understanding of the Thargoids, and resulted in developments that aid us in the conflict. We therefore have a vested interest in protecting his work. We have deployed a security force that will provide continual support while allowing Ram Tah's operation to remain completely independent. Hopefully this will prevent any further disruption." There has been no response from the Sirius Corporation, which recently arrested a cabal of junior officers from its private fleet for launching an incursion into Meene. Li Yong-Rui, the CEO of Sirius Corp, has allegedly withdrawn his offer to work with Ram Tah on Guardian-human technology.^[18]^

23 NOV 3304

- The Sirius Corporation has responded to the revelation that members of its private fleet coordinated a mercenary raid on the Meene system. Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corp, told the media: "Following a thorough inquiry, we have confirmed that a cabal of junior officers, with the aid of mercenaries, orchestrated an illegal operation to gain access to Phoenix Base. Although their intentions remain unclear, I can confirm they were acting purely in their own interests, and without official knowledge. The rogue officers, including those extradited into our custody by the Meene Defence Force, now face multiple charges, and could be imprisoned for life. I would like to express my sincere regret over this incident, and to personally apologise to Ram Tah. I continue to hope that we can work together on further Guardian-human technology."^[17]^

16 NOV 3304

- A link has been established between the mercenary group recently intercepted in the Meene system and the Sirius Corporation. Security Chief Harper Vargas of the Meene Defence Force said: "With the vital assistance of the galactic community, we were able to apprehend several of the mercenaries. Interrogations revealed that a number of them were in fact junior officers in Sirius Corp's private fleet. Other mercenaries confirmed that the attack was funded and organised by these individuals, which raises the question of why Sirius should be involved with this criminal enterprise." The engineer Ram Tah, who operates from Phoenix Base in the Meene system, commented: "Did Sirius really think it could obtain my research by force? Or was this an attempt to scare me into accepting Li Yong-Rui's offer?" A spokesperson for the Sirius Corporation refuted any allegations of criminal activity, and insisted there would be a full inquiry.^[16]^

07 NOV 3304

- A mercenary group has been intercepted by security forces in the Meene system. Security Chief Harper Vargas of the Meene Defence Force reported: "Six hours ago, our forces were attacked by a small fleet belonging to a known mercenary group. Fortunately, we were able to defeat them before they could do serious damage. There is no doubt that the mercenaries' primary target was Phoenix Base. We suspect that this incident is connected to an attempted raid on the base that was repelled a few weeks ago." Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corporation, addressed the incident: "I'm relieved that the attack was foiled, but this only demonstrates how precarious Ram Tah's situation is. I urge him to accept my offer to work with the Sirius Corporation – not only for his own safety, but also to safeguard future Guardian-human technologies."^[13]^

02 NOV 3304

- The engineer Ram Tah has rejected an offer from the Sirius Corporation to support the manufacture of Guardian-human technology. In a public statement, he said: "These technologies, developed using principles discovered by the Guardians, are too important to become corporate products. I have no doubt that Sirius would aim for maximum profits, rather than using the knowledge to aid humanity. Using tech brokers to distribute the designs allows them to be widely available, and thanks to the generosity of Aegis, the tech brokers' costs have been reduced, making Guardian-human fighters and systems more affordable." Li Yong-Rui, CEO of Sirius Corporation, has stated that his offer remains open, and that he hopes Ram Tah will have a change of heart.^[12]^

26 OCT 3304

- The Sirius Corporation has publicly offered to work with engineer Ram Tah in the development of further Guardian-human technology. Li Yong-Rui, the corporation's chief executive officer, made this statement: "Ram Tah's research into the Guardians is of central importance to humanity's future, and I would therefore like to place the resources of the Sirius Corporation at his disposal. As the recent incident at Phoenix Base illustrates, Ram Tah's operation is currently at risk. Not only can we guarantee his safety, but with our manufacturing capabilities we can bring the benefits of Guardian technology to the whole galaxy." There has been a range of reactions from business analysts. Some have advised Ram Tah to take advantage of the offer to mass-produce his designs, while others have warned that Sirius Corp is seeking a monopoly over Guardian-human technology. As yet there has been no response from Ram Tah. Repairs to his base in the Meene system have been completed, following an attempted incursion by armed intruders.^[11]^

22 MAR 3304

- Sirius Corporation announced that it would be expanding its presence in the remote Sothis and Ceos systems with multiple new starports, settlements, and Megaships. The move was a response to the steadily increasing traffic in those two systems.^[60]^

- Li Yong-Rui announced that the search had resulted in the recovery of the wreckage of the Antares.

> 
> 
> The wreckage appears to confirm that the component failure described in the ship's final status report did indeed result in the destruction of the Antares. My hope is that by subjecting the wreckage to further analysis, we will be able to determine exactly what caused the malfunction and apply this knowledge to the development of new safety protocols. With luck, we will be able to reintroduce the innovative drive technology used aboard the Antares. This discovery could serve as the catalyst for a whole new era of interplanetary travel.

> Since the Antares was lost 50 years ago, there have been great advances in scanning technology, and we believe it may now be possible to find the remains of the ship. We are inviting every pilot in the galaxy to deliver wreckage components to our research base at Davy Dock in the Procyon system. Once we have accumulated enough material, we will subject the debris to comprehensive analysis to determine its origin. With luck, not only will we find the remains of the Antares, we will be able to determine her fate.

3251

- A Sirius Corporation vessel known as the Highliner Antares disappeared during its maiden flight in the Sirius system. It was the first ship to use a production version of a new type of hyperdrive. When attempting a hyperspace jump it experienced a simultaneous explosion and mis-jump. The final report concluded that the most likely cause was that a part in the drive had failed just before the jump. No wreckage from the vessel was found. This led to considerable speculation and many conspiracy theories concerning what actually occurred.^[74]^^[59]^
