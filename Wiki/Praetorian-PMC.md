**Praetorian PMC**, more commonly known as **Praetorian**, is a para-military mercenary group composed of ex-military and civilian personnel, working together to provide a community to those in need. Starting as a group of wandering CMDR’s of all professions, the Praetorians banded together to use their diverse skills to earn credits and reputation. Now, Praetorian provides high quality mercenary services to those who need it, having worked for some of the largest factions in both the Federation and Empire. Over time, Praetorian established their own territory, evolving into a hybrid of government and mercenary force, trusted by their growing population to provide both protection and leadership.     

Praetorian PMC was added to Elite Dangerous as a Player Minor Faction on 19 December 2017.^[1]^

## **History**

#### **Humble Beginnings (3302 - 3305)**

Praetorian PMC was founded on March 20th, 3302, by CMDR Wyatt Novak and CMDR bb942. The group started as a combined force of mercenaries, traders, miners and explorers, all working and travelling together for survival. After stopping in LP 1-52, the yet to be named group decided to settle in the system due to its proximity to several useful systems.   

This burst of activity caught the attention of Titan Industries, another mercenary corp who had settled nearby. Several pilots clashed with Titan Industries recon elements in LP 1-52. The group began to stock up on resources for engineering and credits for repairs. The leaders uncovered much intel that could be capitalized on, and the first action using this intel came by June of 3302, when several pilots engaged several Titan mining vessels, caught off guard by the attack. This assault caused a flood of Titan combat vessels in LP 1-52, and soon an all-out war broke out. Friendly pilots continued to defend their territory, while the leaders came up with a plan. Eventually, after both sides suffering many losses, Titan Industries began to slowly decrease the frequency of attacks, and eventually they stopped altogether in August.   

Between the Titan War and the growing need for a purpose, Praetorian PMC was formed. Together, as a unified force, Praetorian PMC began to offer their services to other groups in the galaxy. With the appearance of Thargoids in the Pleiades Nebula, Praetorian pilots spent a good chunk of their time engaged in Thargoid combat, exploring the Milky Way, and working contracts. This continued well into 3304 and 3305.  

#### **Noxx Conflict (3305 - 3306)**

With mounting casualties in the Pleiades Nebula due to the Thargoids, mass recruitment campaigns began to strengthen their numbers. Among the new recruits was CMDR Noxx, who became a trusted advisor to Praetorian. He quickly rose through the ranks, until one day Noxx sabotaged the Praetorian Network, and tried to overthrow Praetorians leadership. He was quickly removed from the faction, but still took a number of members with him. They founded the 104th Humanity Defense Force. 104th Pilots began attacking Praetorian pilots, both in LP 1-52 and other systems. The factions began fighting conflicts, with Praetorian mostly working to defend its territory while the 104th tried to push inside of it. Eventually, after losses on both sides, Praetorian and the 104th met for mediation. The fighting was briefly stopped, but the cease-fire didn’t last, and battles continued for control of LP 1-52. Eventually, the 104th forces pulled out and moved to the “Marines” system. They issued a formal declaration, informing Praetorian to stay away from the system, and the conflict ended.

#### **New Friends, New Faces (3306 - 3307)**

By 3306, Praetorian had largely become a different corporation, and Shepard introduced a new name to the corporation; Blackstar Interstellar Corp. Shepard also began moving resources to a new home, the Barathaona system. As it’s influence grew, the faction gained many contracts, completing multiple anti-xeno contracts and several mining contracts. Eventually, in late 3307, Blackstar was contacted by the Elite Xbox Stellar Alliance, and offered a place in the coalition. The EXSA was a multi-faction alliance headed by CMDR Lev of the Deep Space Syndicate. Blackstar happily accepted, becoming the third faction to join the alliance and a founding member. During this time, Blackstar also reached out to several other independent factions, including the Guardians, The Explorers of the Galactic Table, and the 227th DSRT. 

#### **The Guardians War (3308)**

Flying with the EXSA, Blackstar participated in several events and operations with the faction. During this time, Blackstar pilots participated in several money-making ventures. During one of these trips, Blackstar pilots were engaged by a known pirate, CMDR Kermit. As Blackstar pilots moved to defend themselves, the leader of the Guardians, CMDR Dog Brandon, began defending Kermit, attacking Blackstar pilots. Communication attempts were made, to inform Brandon who he was attacking, but Brandon continued the assault. The news of the Guardians attack was brought to the EXSA, who sent reinforcements. CMDR Lev and several DPSS ships entered the system and helped Blackstar push Brandon and Kermit out of the system. Blackstar and the EXSA began making preparations for war. The EXSA offered several attempts to make peace, offered that Brandon only play reparations for the ships destroyed. The Guardians denied all requests, on January 24th, 3308, Blackstar officially declared war on the Guardians. EXSA war ships poured into the Guardians home system of Dvorsi. The fighting lasted several weeks, and more attempts to get Brandon to pay reparations were made, but ultimately all failed. During this time, the Guardians hired many pirates and gankers to aid in their fight, but eventually Brandon's wealth ran out, and he was forced to retreat. The EXSA celebrated a well-fought victory.

#### **A New Era (3309)**

By the end of 3308, Praetorian was nearing its 50th anniversary, and Shepard, always looking towards the future, made several announcements. First, Blackstar would be moving all its assets back into LP 1-52, their old home. Second, Blackstar would once again return to its original name, Praetorian PMC. By February of 3309, these changes had been complete, and a new era in Praetorians history had begun.

Praetorian Emblem, 3310
 		 	 

Praetorian uses a shield shaped crest as a coat of arms, and for its flag. The main shape is based of a shield of the ancient Earth unit from which Praetorian gets its name, the Praetorian Guard. The shield symbolizes the protection and security that Praetorian provides to its members. The scorpion symbol is derived from the same source, the ancient earth Praetorian Guard. The Scorpio constellation and the stars represent Praetorians interstellar reach. The lightning bolts represent Praetorians power and authority.
