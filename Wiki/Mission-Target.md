A **Mission Target** is a type of signal source that contains mission objectives. They usually only appear when the player has accepted certain types of missions via the Mission Board, but some will appear spontaneously and contain ships that will offer missions of their own.

When a player scans the system with the Discovery Scanner or uses the Nav Beacon, they will receive a message that directs them to a specific celestial body within the system. The signal will spawn within the sphere of influence around the target body and is accompanied by an audio message: "Mission Objective Detected".

## Spawn Locations

Dependent on mission, but usually within the sphere of influence around a celestial body.
