### A New Dawn for Humanity?

**With the Thargoid invasion force seemingly on the edge of defeat, political analysts have presented several arguments for what follows.**

The potential balance of power across the core systems will be heavily influenced by the ambitions of its primary players – perhaps crucially in the Federation, claims Jean-Daniel Moulin:

“*President Winters has finally taken up residence in the White House, ready to face a multitude of challenges. A depressed war economy, mass citizen displacement and a series of late-term policies implemented by the outgoing Zachary Hudson will keep her schedule full for months. Jeremy Archer stands opposite her in Congress, ready to pounce on any signs of weakness and eager to fully emerge from the long shadow of Hudson as the true leader of the Republican party*.”

On the Imperial front, Cassia Carvalho of the Imperial Herald has provided a summary of those most likely to benefit post-invasion:

“*Emperor Arissa remains the figurehead of Imperial authority, and the successful navigation of military, migrant and domestic challenges has only enhanced her popularity. Likewise for Senator Denton Patreus, whose tactical leadership during the Thargoid war reinforced his power as Admiral of the Fleet. Princess Aisling enjoys glowing praise from Aegis figures as part of the Imperial delegation to the anti-xeno initiative, particularly her focus on humanitarian operations. And Senator Zemina Torval seems poised to assume the position of Chancellor in the near future. What comes next for the continued glory of the Empire?*”

In the Alliance, Prime Minister Mahon faces his strongest opposition for some time in the Alliance, according to Vanya Driscoll of the Alliance Tribune:

“*There have been some accusations towards the Prime Minister of a lack of decisive leadership during the Thargoid invasion. His reliance on a military pact with Sirius Corporation to enhance the Alliance Defence Force’s AX capabilities awoke key dissenters to Mahon's otherwise popular rule – most notably from Councillor Nakato Kaine, whose anti-corporate stance and strong devotion to the Alliance’s founding ideals have won her plenty of support*.”

Various newsfeeds discussed other figures: Sirius Corporation’s continued influence over many aspects of the corporate landscape gives CEO Li Yong-Rui considerable power. Pranav Antal, Simguru of the Utopia, leads a far smaller but vital community of devotees convinced of their guide’s future-tech vision.

Yuri Grom remains a prominent independent fleet commander – viewed as a principled liberator to some, and a ruthless dictator to others. Finally, the Pirate King Archon Delaine’s recent targeted attacks on Emperor Arissa and Shadow President Archer suggests he sees an opportunity to expand his criminal influence in the early post-Invasion era.

### Powerplay Standings: November 3310

**With a renewed focus on internal politics within the core systems, Conrad Sterling of Vox Galactica has provided an analysis of the current support for key figures of importance based on system allegiance.**

Population surveys suggest the following five powers lead the way in this early stage:

Rank 1: Edmund Mahon - 1355 systems

Rank 2: Aisling Duval - 1296 systems

Rank 3: Arissa Lavigny-Duval - 1162 systems

Rank 4: Yuri Grom - 956 systems

Rank 5: Pranav Antal - 659 systems

With power influence fluctuating from week to week, it remains to be seen if these powers will enjoy their relatively large influence over the coming months.

Powers are offering plenty of incentives and rewards for those pledging to their cause, with independent pilots reaping the benefits of the growing struggle for prestige and authority.

Vox Galactica will continue to monitor the ongoing political landscape as it unfolds.

### Aegis Urges High Alert for Anti-Xeno Forces

Professor Alba Tesreau, Head of Aegis, has issued a warning for all anti-xeno fleets to remain on high alert.

The warning comes as human forces continue to push towards the last remaining Thargoid Titan, Cocijo. While victory over the Thargoid invasion force seems likely at this stage, Tesreau has urged defensive fleets not to become complacent.

“*We have seen repeatedly that the Thargoid fleets are capable of surprising us when their defeat seems inevitable. The Proteus Wave incident in HIP 22460 is a perfect example of this – our confidence was such that Salvation’s celebratory speech was broadcast across the core systems only moments before he was killed by a Thargoid counterattack, along with thousands of military personnel*.”

“*Seo Jin-ae has - rather publicly - insisted that her recent medical emergency was the result of the Thargoids seeking to learn about her and, by extension, humanity as a whole. Should this prove true, we must assume that the Thargoids have new information to identify human targets, orchestrate attacks and more. In recent days, Seo stated that the Thargoid hive mind has altered its ‘tone’ in a way which has previously led to a change in Thargoid tactics*.”

“*With this in mind, I implore AX defensive forces protecting our ports and worlds from Thargoid assault to stay vigilant. Shinrarta Dezhra’s recent invasion proved the Thargoid fleet can still push behind the war’s front line*.”

Aegis has received criticism over its perceived failure to protect Seo Jin-ae from Thargoid interception. Most notably, Imperial Fleet Admiral Denton Patreus commented that Seo should be ‘closely watched’ following her medical incident.

### Titan Cocijo Moves Deeper into Core Systems

The last remaining Thargoid Titan, Cocijo, has unexpectedly left the Col 285 Sector BA-P c6-18 system.

Reports from human AX forces fighting through surrounding systems to expose the Titan say it has reverted to the transient signal source detected prior to the Titan’s arrival on the edges of human space. Travelling at phenomenal speeds, Cocijo appears to be heading further into the core systems.

A general alert has been raised in all populated systems. Aden Tanner, special military advisor to Aegis, gave the following statement via all newsfeeds:

“*Aegis sensors have confirmed that Cocijo is on a path deep into human territory. Rather than seek to escape from the war, the final Titan intends to bring the fight to our heartlands*.”

“*Precautionary evacuation efforts have begun in Sol, based on our earliest predictions of Cocijo’s trajectory. But all civilians must be prepared to evacuate their homes at short notice. Our first priority is to minimise casualties wherever it arrives – we saw the devastating effect of a Titan beachhead in the first days of the invasion and must do our best to avoid any repeat of this*.”

Thargoid controlled systems appear to be completely empty, amid fears that the remaining Thargoid fleet has set a course in pursuit of the Titan. AX defensive forces are scrambling to prepare for Cocijo’s arrival, though Allied, Federal and Imperial fleet admirals have all stated that a plan exists for this very scenario.

Rescue megaships are awaiting orders but are expected to move from their current locations to aid in the predicted evacuation efforts.
