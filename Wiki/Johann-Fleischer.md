### Occupation

Vice President of Caine-Massey

**Johann Fleisher** was the Vice President of Caine-Massey, a Federal mining mega corporation. In January 3308, he filed a complaint with the Federal Commerce Authority over Torval Mining Ltd's efforts to claim an expired mining contract with multiple corporations operating in the vicinity of Dulos that Caine-Massey had held for the previous decade. When the FCA ruled the Imperial company had not violated any law, Fleisher struck an agreement with Torval Mining Ltd to decide who would win the contract by holding a mining competition. Caine-Massey garnered more support from independent pilots than Torval Mining Ltd, and renewed the Dulos contract through 3318.

## Timeline

20 JAN 3308

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
The Caine-Massey corporation has beaten Torval Mining Ltd to retain a mining contract in the Dulos system. Competing campaigns were waged by the two rivals for the rights to supply ore and mined materials to many local subsidiaries. Johann Fleischer, vice president of Caine-Massey, declared their victory: "We wish to thank the large number of pilots who delivered bromellite, samarium and gallite. Thanks to your hard work, our contract has been renewed for another decade. I like to think that we have also secured the honour of the Federation by stalling the Empire's plans." Rewards for contributors to Caine-Massey are now available for collection at Smith Port in the Dulos system. Torval Mining Ltd also received many deliveries of materials but in insufficient quantities to secure the contract. Constantia Torval has confirmed that the pilots who supported their initiative can collect payment at the Pride of Bitterwood megaship.^[1]^

13 JAN 3308

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
Caine-Massey and Torval Mining Ltd are running rival campaigns to deliver mined commodities to the Dulos system. For the past decade, the megacorp Caine-Massey has supplied ore and other raw materials to several subsidiaries in the region. But with the contract up for renewal, Torval Mining Ltd is making a bid for the lucrative business. Constantia Torval, operations director for the Empire-based company, outlined the initiative: "We are calling upon pilots to provide the following mined materials: bromellite, samarium and gallite. These should be delivered to the Pride of Bitterwood in the Dulos system. Your assistance will directly support our proposal to win this contract and expand our entire enterprise." Caine-Massey published a similar request from its vice president, Johann Fleischer: "The citizens within this region deserve a high standard of service, and we aim to continue meeting their needs. The Green Party of Dulos, acting on our behalf, shall offer generous rewards for shipments of mined bromellite, samarium and gallite delivered to Smith Port in the Dulos system." The corporate distributors within the region have agreed that whichever candidate is able to provide the greatest amount of materials will be awarded the contract for the next decade.^[2]^

11 JAN 3308

- The company owned by Senator Zemina Torval is attempting to acquire a mining contract previously awarded to the Caine-Massey corporation. The agreement affects multiple corporations on the fringes of Federal space around the Dulos system, who for the last decade have purchased mined ore and other raw materials directly from Caine-Massey. With the contract up for renewal, Torval Mining Ltd has made an official bid. An announcement was made by Constantia Torval, the company's operations director and daughter of Zemina Torval: "We have enjoyed enormous success in a short space of time by providing services to the Empire. This is an opportunity to reach a broader customer base, and convince them that they too can benefit from Torval Mining's expertise." Johann Fleischer, the vice president of Caine-Massey, remarked: "Our corporation is proud of its origins within the Federation, and we have supplied these systems with resources for many years. This is a surreptitious attempt by an Imperial senator to boost her own standing by hijacking Federal business." The Federal Commerce Authority has responded to Caine-Massey's request for intervention. An initial review found that, while it recognises the aggression of the Torval Mining claims, there is no exclusivity clause in place that prevents the companies in question from holding talks with an Imperial supplier now Caine-Massey's contract term is expiring.^[3]^
