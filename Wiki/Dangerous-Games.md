# Dangerous Games
The **Dangerous Games** were a competition held from June 2, 3302 to July 21, 3302 that involved 16 minor factions seeking to achieve Power status with backing from commanders. Five of the competitors were some of the largest and most supported minor factions of the time, and were granted five of the six participation slots of the Dangerous Games' main phase, the "Rise to Power". The other 11 competitors vied for the sixth slot in the Dangerous Games by competing in the preliminary "Pledge" and "Wildcard" phases. The Wildcard and Rise to Power phases of the Dangerous Games were divided into three heats, through which supporters of each faction were required to make a tangible demonstration of their support in a series of weekly Community Goals. The winner of those phases was whichever faction had accrued the greatest combined support across all three heats.

The EG Pilots, led by Dictator Yuri Grom, a former Federal Navy admiral, swept the entire competition, winning the greatest percentage of support in the Pledge phase, winning all three heats of the Wildcard phase and advancing to the main event, and then winning all three heats of the Rise to Power. Grom's status as the galaxy's newest Power was made official on October 27, 3302, and he established his headquarters in the Clayakarma system.

## Timeline

27 OCT 3302

- The Dangerous Games dominated headlines earlier this year, as some of galaxy's most powerful minor factions took part in a brutal battle for supremacy. After weeks of fierce competition involving hundreds of independent pilots, it was the EG Pilots who emerged victorious. Having spent the intervening months consolidating their assets, the EG Pilots are now ready to enter the galactic stage. Consequently, the temporary restriction on preparatory activity in systems within 30 light years of the Clayakarma, Nauo, Gyhldekala, Boga and Kpaniya systems – imposed by the United Research Council partly to allow the EG Pilots an opportunity to secure their position – has now been lifted. Like all powers, the organisation will seek the support of the galaxy's independent pilots, who will play a central role in its fate. Very little is known about the group's leader, Yuri Grom, although he is understood to have started his career in the Federal Navy, reaching the rank of Admiral before parting with the Federation and entering politics. Following a brief conflict in the Euryale system, in which Grom clashed with his former Federal allies, the ex-admiral emerged as the leader of his own independent power. Propaganda distributed by the EG Pilots offers a succinct description of Grom: "Yuri is idolized by his supporters and respected throughout his controlled systems. His support among the populace is absolute, his dominion unshakable." One thing is for sure – Grom's career, and the future of the EG Pilots, promises to be anything but boring.^[3]^

21 JUL 3302

- The third and final heat of the Rise to Power campaign is over. For this stage of the competition, pilots were asked to recover salvaged precious gems and deliver them to Laura Elizabeth in the Meropis system. Matters were complicated by the fact that the event organisers refused to reveal the precise whereabouts of the salvage site, giving just a single clue to its location. Once the location was found, a desperate race began as pilots urgently ferried the gems to the Laura Elizabeth starport in support of their chosen faction. Ultimately, it was the EG Pilots who received the most salvaged precious gems and claimed victory. But the celebrations were short-lived, as the EG Pilots waited tensely for the announcement of the overall victor. Now that the results of each heat have been reviewed, the event organisers have announced that the winner of the Rise to Power campaign is...the EG Pilots. Trinity Avon, reporting for The Sovereign, commented on what has proved to be an exciting competition: "The EG Pilots have shown that they has the necessary strength and influence to be recognised as a power in their own right. I for one look forward to seeing what the future holds."^[4]^

14 JUL 3302

- The third and final stage of the Rise to Power campaign is about to begin. For this heat, pilots have been asked to salvage precious gems and deliver them to Laura Elizabeth in the Meropis system. But the event organisers have chosen to complicate matters by refusing to reveal the precise whereabouts of the salvage site. Pilots participating in the event have been given just one clue to its location - the following signal:
353133313639313835 3432313232313132 31393235313932303531333139 A6B1D4H1I4K1L1M2N1O2R1U1V1Y1Z1 3132313533313132 373131323134353230 32353133313531343139
The group that manages to accumulate the most precious gems will be declared the winner of the final Rise to Power event. At the close of the event, the results of each heat will be reviewed. The faction that has garnered the most support over the course of the campaign will join the ranks of the galaxy's major power players. The event begins on the 14th of July 3302 and will run for one week.^[5]^

14 JUL 3302

- The second heat of the Rise to Power campaign is over. For this event, pilots were asked to head to the Nervi system and gather technical blueprints for their chosen faction. The one condition imposed on the pilots was that the technical blueprints must be stolen – a stipulation that gave rise to a number of clashes with Nervi security forces. The final tally indicates that the largest quantity of technical blueprints was received by the EG Pilots, making them the winner of this stage of the campaign. But whether or not the EG Pilots will win the Rise to Power competition remains to be seen, as it will not be clear which faction has received the most support until the end of the campaign. The Rise to Power competition will run for one more week, and the victor will go on to join the ranks of the galaxy's major power players.^[6]^

07 JUL 3302

- The first stage of the Rise to Power campaign is over, and the second is about to begin. This phase of the competition will focus on what has been euphemistically referred to as commodity reallocation, with pilots being asked to gather as many technical blueprints as they can for their chosen faction. The only condition is that the technical blueprints be obtained unlawfully...which is to say stolen. The group with the most technical blueprints at the end of the event will be declared the winner. The Rise to Power competition will run for a total of three weeks, and the victor will go on to join the ranks of the galaxy's major power players. The event begins on the 7th of July 3302 and will run for one week.^[7]^

07 JUL 3302

- Last week saw the start of the Rise to Power competition, a three-week campaign to determine which of the galaxy's largest factions wields the greatest degree of power and influence. The winner of the competition will be in a position to compete with the galaxy's major power players. The first Rise to Power event required pilots to gather Gilya signature weapons for their chosen faction and deliver it to Gohar Station in the Jaradharre system. The week-long event saw plenty of conflict, with pilots doing everything in their power to disrupt their rivals' operations. The final tally indicates that the EG Pilots are the winner of the first Rise to Power heat, having received the largest quantity of Gilya signature weapons. But whether the EG Pilots will claim ultimate victory remains to be seen.^[8]^

30 JUN 3302

- For much of the past month, the galactic community has been captivated by the Dangerous Games, a semi-official competition organised by some of the galaxy's largest factions to determine which wields the greatest degree of power and influence. Three events have taken place so far, with pilots from across the galaxy fighting fervently to support their chosen group. With the 'Wildcard' stage of the competition over, it is time for the main event to begin. Trinity Avon, a reporter for The Sovereign, explained how the Rise to Power will work: "There are six factions taking part: the EG Pilots, the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps, the Border Coalition, GalCop, the Interstellar Communist Union and the Social Eleu Progressive Party. Over the next three weeks, there will be a series of campaigns in which each faction will try to rally as much support as possible. The faction that dominates its rivals will join the ranks of the galaxy's most powerful." The first Rise to Power event requires pilots to gather Gilya signature weapons for their chosen faction and deliver them to Gohar Station in the Jaradharre system. The faction that accumulates the most Gilya signature weapons will be declared the winner of the first heat. The event begins on the 30th of June 3302 and will run for one week.^[9]^

23 JUN 3302

- The third and final heat of the Dangerous Games Wildcard competition is over. For this stage of the competition, pilots were asked to fill their cargo holds with conductive fabrics and deliver them to Tartarus Point for their chosen faction. Hundreds of pilots participated in the event, eager to help their faction secure a place in the Dangerous Games. But ultimately it was the EG Pilots that accumulated the most conductive fabrics and once again claimed victory. With the competition over, the results of each heat have been reviewed to determine which faction received the most support over the course of the campaign. The final result indicates that the winner of the Dangerous Games Wildcard competition is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the EG Pilots. The EG Pilots will now enter the Dangerous Games, competing with the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps, the Border Coalition, GalCop, the Interstellar Communist Union and the Social Eleu Progressive Party for the right to join the ranks of the galaxy's most powerful. Trinity Avon, a reporter for The Sovereign, commented on what has proved to be a dramatic competition: "Each faction has enjoyed its share of success, but ultimately there could be only one winner. The EG Pilots have proved they can attract considerable support, but does that mean they can go toe to toe with the likes of the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps and the Social Eleu Progressive Party? Only time will tell." The Dangerous Games will begin on the 30th of June.^[10]^

16 JUN 3302

- With the second stage of the Dangerous Games Wildcard competition complete, the third and final stage can now begin. This phase of the competition will focus on trade, with pilots being asked to gather as many conductive fabrics as possible for their chosen faction. The group with the most conductive fabrics at the end of the week-long event will be declared the winner. At the close of the Wildcard competition, the faction that has garnered the most support over the course of the campaign will enter the Dangerous Games and compete for the right to be recognised as an official power. With the end of the competition looming, each faction is eager to secure as much support as possible, and is doing all it can to attract pilots to its cause. The event begins on the 16th of June 3302 and will run for one week.^[11]^

16 JUN 3302

- The second heat of the Dangerous Games Wildcard competition is over. For this event, pilots were asked to deploy their hardpoints and gather bounties for their chosen faction in the Bjorti system. The group that accumulated the most bounty vouchers during the week-long event would be declared the winner. The final tally indicates that victory goes once again to the EG Pilots, which received the largest amount of bounty vouchers. Whether or not the EG Pilots will win the Wildcard competition remains to be seen, as it will not be clear which faction has received the most support until the end of the campaign. The Dangerous Games Wildcard competition will run for a total of three weeks, and the victor will go on to vie for the right to be recognised as an official power.^[12]^

09 JUN 3302

- The first stage of the Dangerous Games 'Wildcard' competition is over, and the second is about to begin. For this heat, pilots have been asked to head to the Bjorti system and deploy their hardpoints for a bounty-hunting contest. The faction that accumulates the most bounty vouchers during the week-long event will be declared the winner. The Dangerous Games Wildcard competition will run for a total of three weeks, and the victor will go on to vie for the right to be recognised as an official power. The event begins on the 9th of June 3302 and will run for one week.^[13]^

09 JUN 3302

- Last week saw the start of a three-week campaign to determine which of the galaxy's minor factions would earn a place in the forthcoming Dangerous Games. The victor of the so-called 'Wildcard' competition will go on to vie for the right to be recognised as an official power. The first Wildcard event required pilots to fire up their mining lasers and gather gold for their chosen faction. Predictably, the week-long event saw no small measure of conflict, with pilots doing everything they could to disrupt their rivals' operations. The final tally indicates that the EG Pilots received the largest quantity of gold. But whether or not this will result in ultimate victory remains to be seen, as it will not be clear which faction has received the most support until the end of the three-week campaign.^[14]^

02 JUN 3302

- The galaxy is home to countless factions, some boasting thousands of members and others comprising only a handful of individuals. Some exist to serve the galactic community, while others follow more antagonistic dogmas. For almost every creed in human space, there is a corresponding faction. Recent reports indicate that the largest of these factions have gained such significant levels of power and influence that they are on the cusp of being recognized as powers in their own right. This development coincides with mounting speculation that the empire of Pirate Lord Archon Delaine, once the most formidable power in the Pegasi Sector, is on the brink of collapse. With a paradigm shift looming, the largest of the galaxy's factions have taken the unprecedented step of organising a semi-official competition for the right to be recognised as an official power. The name of this competition? The Dangerous Games. Trinity Avon, a reporter for The Sovereign, elaborated on the nature of the event: "There are five factions competing in the Dangerous Games: the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps, the Border Coalition, GalCop, the Interstellar Communist Union and the Social Eleu Progressive Party. Between June and July 3302, these groups will participate in a series of community campaigns, giving the galaxy's independent pilots a chance to support their chosen faction." But these will not be the only factions taking part. With the start of the event still some weeks away, a number of smaller factions have begun competing for their chance to participate in the Dangerous Games. In the coming weeks, these factions will attempt to rally Commanders to their respective causes through a series of community-oriented events. Whichever faction successfully dominates its rivals in these 'Wildcard' events will enter the Dangerous Games, competing for the right to join the ranks of the galaxy's most powerful. The first Wildcard event requires pilots to fire up their mining lasers and gather gold for their chosen faction. The faction with the most gold at the end of the week-long campaign will be declared the victor of the first Wildcard heat. Naturally, pilots are also free to disrupt their rivals' efforts. The event begins on the 2nd of June 3302 and will run for one week.^[15]^

## Notes

- All of the minor factions involved in the Dangerous Games were player-supported minor factions. The Dangerous Games themselves were a competition arranged by Frontier Developments to allow one player minor faction and their custom-designed leader character to become the 11th Power in Powerplay.
- EG Pilots' victory in the Dangerous Games became controversial when it was discovered that they had used bots during the competition, and continued to use bots to support Yuri Grom in Powerplay. On July 26, 2019, EG Pilots announced they would cease active support of Yuri Grom.^[16]^
- Members of all ten participating minor factions in the Dangerous Games were given exclusive ship decals made from their respective logos.
