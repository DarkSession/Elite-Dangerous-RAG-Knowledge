The **Galactic Insurance Company** is a corporation that provides insurance to pilots. When a ship is destroyed, the pilot can recover their old ship loadout for a percentage fee or take an unmodified Sidewinder MkI loaned by the Pilots Federation. The insurance fee is derived from the ship's purchase cost. If the fee cannot be paid and the pilot has no alternative but to accepted the loaned Sidewinder, the pilot's old ship loadout will be permanently discarded.^[1]^
