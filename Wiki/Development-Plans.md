### Future plans

Plans for seasons or expansions after *Odyssey* are not yet announced.

## Roadmap

The expansions were planned include significant new features such as seamless freeform (manual pitch/yaw/roll) atmospheric flight and landings (see Atmospheric Landings) and on-foot and out-of-ship activities (see On Foot) such as FPS combat, walking around and boarding ships, walking in stations and walking and driving vehicles on entire 1:1 scale populated living planets (see Procedural Cities) with multi-player crew and player executive controlled capital ships.^[11]^

Frontier wrote in a newsletter, *"We plan to follow that same incremental development philosophy that we’ve done throughout our Alpha and Beta phases, and continue to significantly enhance the game via further expansions post-launch."*^[11]^

Frontier intends to release small, free updates after launch. Expansions that include significant new features and content will have to be purchased.^[11]^

For example, the roadmap is to add these features with major updates (in no particular order): ^[11]^^[12]^

- Walking around interiors and combative boarding of other ships. - see On Foot.
- Combat and other interactions with other players and AIs in the internal areas of star ports - speculated
- Accessing richly detailed planetary surfaces - see Atmospheric Landings and Procedural Cities.
- Availability of giant ‘executive control’ ships to players. - see Capital Ships.
- Base Building was a rumored feature (not on the roadmap) - this was revealed as System Colonisation in Nov 2024

The Development Plan video (14 Dec 2012) Braben stated: "w*e're designing all the ships with the interiors in mind, how the cargo is unloaded all that sort of thing, how damage occurs. That's because another thing that we are doing again down the line is you will be able to walk around inside your ship, you will be able to get out of your ship, walk around inside space stations, other vehicles. All of that sort of thing. We've shown the damage on the ship, the damage models. Imagine looking at that from inside the ship outwards seeing your cargo flying out into space, seeing the flames, trying to fight them. All of those things that we plan with time, they won't be at the first release because we want to do them right and want to do them well. All of these will be done as updates."*^[13]^

## 10 Year Development Plan

During the 2016 Elite Dangerous 24 Hour Charity Livestream! David Braben confirmed a 10 year development plan and that he hopes it will be a lot longer than that: "*Looking back at those (developer videos), you can see what we've done, we're executing on the plan. There's still a lot of things that are to come and those are very exciting. We do have a long plan. It would take us a long time to deliver all the things that we want to do. The great thing is the more things get added to the end of it. So it may well be never ending. I've said sort of 8 years, 10 years, but actually it could end up and I'm hoping it'll be a lot longer than that. The key point is we'll keep doing exciting things and we'll work out how best to do that."*^[15]^

## Lifetime Expansion Pass

The Lifetime Expansion Pass or **LEP** is a content pass for Elite Dangerous that includes ownership of all current and future expansions produced for the game plus a selection of cosmetic Livery items.^[11]^

The LEP was included for Kickstarter backers who purchased the £80 "Digital Download Pack" tier in 2012. It was also available during the pre-launch beta period in 2014 and for a final time from August 6, 2015 to September 14, 2015. 

## Developer Comments

On 12 March 2015, David Braben said, *"We’ve said things like going down to planet surfaces, walking around inside your spaceship, getting out of your ship, all of those things would be part of paid updates. And we would phase it, we wouldn’t necessarily do them as part of one big thing, there would be multiple over time. Cause each of those, if you think of the work to do each one, it’s a major new-game-level of content. And so we’re just trying to take that seriously. We don’t want to do half-baked solutions."*^[16]^

On 20 March 2015, David Braben was asked about the long roadmap ahead and he answered, *"Well I'm very excited. I've said over a long time I'm very excited about some features that we will do down the road including things like landing on planets, walking around inside your spaceship, getting out of your spaceship, all of those things I think are very very exciting and obviously those are in the long-term roadmap."*^[17]^

On 26 July 2018, Braben said, *"We’ve continued to support and nurture the existing franchises. Elite Dangerous has continued to grow, the team size is actually getting bigger. The plan was – beyond the current season for Elite, which is mostly announced – there are a lot of things that we will be announcing that are really exciting, some of which will be free, some of which will be paid."*^[18]^

This is a traders quote from the investment firm Liberum in 2019: *"The company is working on a number of exciting updates for both franchies and our expectation is that we could see a big refresh release of ED in FY20, five years after launch (we expect Elite Dangerous to be closing in on £100m of life-time revenue by the end of this financial year)."*^[19]^^[20]^

## Development Team

On 26 May 2017, Frontier's Lloyd Morgan-Moore said, *"The Elite Dangerous team is over a hundred people strong."*^[21]^

On 31 August 2018, Zac Antonaci reaffirmed that more than 100 people are working on Elite Dangerous: *"The Beyond season was always something that we wanted to do in order to bring even more enhancements to the core experience of Elite and being able to dedicate a full development team (over 100 people!) for a full year of free content was specifically to gear ourselves up to support our long term vision for the game."*^[22]^

On 27 September 2018, a small group of community guests visited the Frontier headquarters in Cambridge to check features of Beyond Chapter Four. One of them, Vingtetun, then posted, *"For the record, yes, the numbers of people working JUST on ED are what they say, their other games were on other floors and no, jobs like HR and finance etc staff weren't part of that number. It was all people actively working on Elite. Compared to my last visit, they aren't kidding when they say the team has never been bigger. The sweeping improvements and changes have satisfied me that they haven't been idle in the last year of the free 'Beyond' update."*^[23]^

## Elite Dangerous Sequel

In an interview with PCGN at E3 2018, Frontier's founder and CEO, David Braben, said that while he would not rule out a sequel to the deep-space adventure, fans should not expect to see anything on that topic soon.^[24]^

Braben said, *“The world has changed. We’re coming to the end of the fourth year of Elite Dangerous.”* This advanced development is *“a wonderful place to be in”* but they continue support for the current game. That *“isn’t to say there won’t be something at some point.”* A potential sequel is a *“long time off and there is lots to do in the Elite Dangerous world.*”^[24]^
