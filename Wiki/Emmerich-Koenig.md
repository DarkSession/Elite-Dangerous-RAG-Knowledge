## Timeline

03 SEP 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
A new starport has become operational in the LTT 198 system, following Senator Zemina Torval's mining initiative. Torval Orbital will serve as the administrative headquarters for Torval-Mastopolos Mining. The company successfully competed against Wreaken Corporation to establish a presence within LTT 198. Marlon Royce, business analyst for Vox Galactica, observed: "Mastopolos Mining should be boasting about the positive start for its new subsidiary. Instead, its reaction has only confirmed the widening rift between the Mastopolos family and their corporation's majority shareholder, Zemina Torval. CEO Gabriella Mastopolos officially distanced herself from the offshoot company, claiming it 'hijacked our name with the intention of luring our clients'. And speaking to Imperial media, both Adrian and Elena Mastopolos criticised Constantia Torval's suitability to act as operations director. Speculation persists as to why the families have become estranged. For now, Zemina Torval seems to be focusing solely on her direct descendants. With her youngest daughter Petra Torval becoming a fellow senator, and grandson Titus Torval promoted to a senior role in Imperial Intelligence, the future seems bright for the Torval dynasty."^[1]^

The Torval-Mastopolos Mining initiative in the LTT 198 system has outperformed Wreaken Construction's rival campaign. Pilots delivered mined resources to the megaships Pride of Bitterwood and Tobias's Gift to support the competing corporations. Ultimately, it was the new subsidiary of Mastopolos Mining that received the greatest quantities. Senator Zemina Torval provided a statement to Imperial media: "This is an auspicious beginning for my new enterprise. I am pleased to offer rewards to my supporters at the Pride of Bitterwood in the EGM 559 system." In addition to credits, the top 75% of Torval's supporters will be provided with an experimental mining laser and permanent permit access to LTT 198. Constantia Torval, one of the senator's daughters, has assumed the role of director of operations with Torval-Mastopolos Mining. There has been no comment from the Mastopolos family regarding the subsidiary, which is being run autonomously by Zemina Torval. CEO Emmerich Koenig confirmed that Wreaken Construction will soon withdraw from LTT 198. Pilots who supported its efforts can now claim reimbursement from Tobias's Gift in the EGM 559 system. The top 10% of Koenig's supporters will receive an experimental abrasion blaster as well. LTT 198 State Ltd has reinstated permit control for entry to the LTT 198 system. A new starport will shortly be constructed and administered by Torval-Mastopolos Mining.^[2]^

Torval-Mastopolos Mining and Wreaken Construction have requested deliveries of mined resources to the LTT 198 system. LTT 198 State Ltd, its controlling faction, will only allow one of the rival corporations to remain permanently. The company with the most successful campaign will establish a new starport in the permit-controlled system. Senator Zemina Torval, who has sole control of the Mastopolos Mining subsidiary, announced: "My company is working on an experimental mining laser with increased range. To achieve this, shipments of mined resources must be delivered in sufficient numbers to the Pride of Bitterwood megaship in LTT 198." Emmerich Koenig, CEO of Wreaken Construction, outlined a counter-initiative: "We will pay handsomely for deliveries of mined resources to the megaship Tobias's Gift in the LTT 198 system." Both factions have requested units of coltan, gallite, praseodymium and silver. LTT 198 State Ltd will provide all contributors to these initiatives with temporary system permits lasting one week.^[3]^
