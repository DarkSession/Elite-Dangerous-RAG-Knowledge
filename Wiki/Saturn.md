**Saturn** is the 6th and lightest planet in the Sol system. Saturn is famous for its prominent ring system which surrounds the gas giant, which is so light it would float in water. Saturn also has 82 moons, the most of any planet in Sol. Two of Saturn's moons are famous for how surprisingly habitable they are: Enceladus and Titan. Titan possesses a substantial atmosphere about as dense as Earth's and has liquid lakes of methane and ethane on its surface, and Enceladus has a life-supporting ocean of water beneath its icy surface which may contain life as we know it.

Saturn's planetary ring system consists of countless particles, shattered comets, moons and  asteroids.^[1]^^[2]^
