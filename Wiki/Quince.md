## Tourist Beacons

### Quince Visitor Beacon

Binary planets are always fun places to visit, such as in this case, before you head on to the outdoor world to sample the delights there.^[1]^

### Gaylen's Ascension

The ascension of Gaylen Trasken Duval was marked with chaotic celebrations in the Achenar and **Quince** systems. With a new Emperor on the throne, the imperial political agenda changed again. Gaylen proved to be a more prickly and temperamental character than his predecessor. Hostilities at Alioth were renewed in 2994, whilst a Federation supported coup in the Ackwada system was ruthlessly suppressed by the Imperial backed forces in 2996.^[2]^
