**Eden** is a high metal content world in the Alpha Centauri system. It is the only planet orbiting the star Proxima Centauri. Hutton Orbital orbits it.

> Eden was the first planet on which liquid water was detected by spectroscopic methods in 2038, and so it was a major driving force for the exploration of space. However, Eden turned out to be extremely inhospitable with the added danger of hard radiation from Proxima. There is now a small research station on Eden, but little else in the rest of the system. Star was once known as Rigel Kentaurus.
