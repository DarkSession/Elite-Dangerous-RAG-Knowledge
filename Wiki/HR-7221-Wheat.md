> This blood-red, grain-like plant - sometimes known as 'Mars Grass' - has proven itself to be terribly invasive and highly aggressive to all other plant types. For this reason, its growth is now restricted to HR 7221. Its restriction has proved a blessing as its unique colouring and flavour are in demand in exotic cookery.
