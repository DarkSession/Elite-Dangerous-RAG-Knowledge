# Clean Thrusters
**Clean Thrusters** is an engineer modification that can be applied to thrusters. It reduces thermal load and increases speed, at the cost of increased power draw, and reduced integrity.

It is available in 5 grades, with the highest grade offering up to 60% reduction in thermal load, and 28% increase in speed.

Although Clean drives have a reduced thermal load, they do not run significantly cooler than unengineered thrusters. This is because their increased power draw will increase the heat produced by the ship's power plant. The reduced thermal load of clean drives is more noticeable when compared against dirty drives. When rigged for silent running, a ship equipped with clean drive tuning will take longer to overheat than if it is equipped with dirty drive tuning.
