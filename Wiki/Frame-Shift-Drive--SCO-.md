The **Frame Shift Drive (SCO)** is a hyperdrive system manufactured by Achilles Aerospace. It was introduced to the market in 3310 after research on Thargoid Titan travel.^[1]^ The SCO Frame Shift Drive is capable of both supercruise and hyperspace jumps, with an additional capability of supercruise overcharge, allowing faster travel within a star system.

## History

From 3297 to 3310, Frame Shift Drives manufactured solely by the Sirius Corporation were in predominant use among human civilisation. In 3308, during the Second Thargoid War, seven Thargoid Titans were observed travelling through interstellar space at faster-than-light speed, towards the core systems. ^[2]^ Following the destruction of one of the Titans designated *Taranis*, Achilles Aerospace announced their research into the Titan's travel technology, requesting independent pilots to collect Titan drive components from the wreckage of *Taranis*. ^[3]^ This initiative was successful^[4]^, and Achilles Aerospace brought their prototype Frame Shift Drive to market on 10 April 3310. ^[1]^ The line of SCO Frame Shift Drives was initially limited to C-rated modules, with safety limits restricting the potential range for hyperspace jumps. A full selection of SCO Frame Shift Drives became available in May 3310, with the safety limits being lifted at the same time. ^[5]^^[6]^

The first pilots who used Achilles' Frame Shift Drives reported immense mechanical and thermal stress when using the supercruise overcharge function. ^[7]^ Ship manufacturers started designing ships that could overcome overcharge stress. The Python MkII was the first ship to be designed around the Achilles Frame Shift Drive, boasting improved performance and reduced fuel consumption.^[8]^

## Usage

In supercruise, the boost function will activate and deactivate Supercruise Overcharge by pressing the assigned button. During an overcharge, the Frame Shift Drive will accelerate rapidly, but there are multiple drawbacks: it will consume large amounts of fuel, generate a thermal load which can overheat the ship, and the ship's controls will suffer interference.  

After deactivating a supercruise overcharge, there is a cooldown before the ship can start another overcharge. Commanders can see when another ship is in cooldown on their HUD's target info panel. The ship will decelerate to normal supercruise speed, but setting maximum throttle will reduce the rate of deceleration. 

Supercruise overcharge will be deactivated during an interdiction.

Supercruise overcharge (SCO) is very beneficial for shorter-distance travel rather than long-distance such as to Hutton Orbital. It can be used for short bursts of speed to overcome the gravity wells of celestial bodies, greatly speeding up the start and end of a typical journey within a system.  

For example: the C7 FSD has the slowest and worst acceleration curve. When using the C7 FSD in a star system with a second star that is 182,000ls from the primary star; with normal supercruise the journey is 11 minutes, 30 seconds. If you do use SCO, the journey is just 5 minutes, 30 seconds. So travel time is cut by more than half. For shorter jumps it can cut travel time to 1/10th or less.^[10]^ Leaving a planet's gravity well is reduced from 1-3 minutes to 3 seconds.

The SCO enables rapid interplanetary travel, making planet mapping, exobiology, mining, and exploration activities in general much faster and more convenient, especially in combination with a Fleet Carrier. 

Comparing the A-rated modules, the SCO-capable Frame Shift Drives have an "optimised mass" stat around 12% higher than the older Sirius drives, as well as a 4% higher "max fuel per jump" stat, meaning the Class 5A SCO drives offer more jump range when fully engineered than even the "Engineered FSD V1" that is acquired through Technology Brokers.^[11]^ 

### Downsides

While using supercruise overcharge, acceleration increases rapidly and continuously to the max speed. The boost cannot be throttled. SCO also has a very high fuel consumption. During overcharge, a ship's handling is decreased due to turbulence, and has a similar effect to being interdicted.^[8]^ SCO also generates a substantial amount of heat while active, which can severely damage the ship and its modules if left unchecked.

If your ship ends an overcharged supercruise in an emergency drop, it will suffer severe damage to its hull and modules. If the ship runs low on fuel during supercruise overcharge, the safety mechanism of the Flight Assist will perform an emergency drop, leaving a small amount of fuel in the reserve fuel tank. You should refuel at the nearest station, settlement or visit a scoopable star. If you run out of fuel you can ask the Fuel Rats for assistance.

To sustain a supercruise overcharge for a longer period of time, a ship needs to equip heat sink launchers and carry fuel tanks in its optional slots.   

### Ships Designed for Supercruise Overcharge

The Python MkII, Type-8 Transporter, Mandalay, and Cobra Mk V were designed from the ground up with advanced Supercruise Overcharge capabilities for better handling, heat management, better acceleration and deceleration, and less fuel consumption with SCO. The result is an overall smoother ride.

### Outfitting

Unlike standard Frame Shift Drives, only a full size Frame Shift Drive (SCO) is compatible with a ship's given Frame Shift Drive component slot. Using a lower class Frame Shift Drive (SCO) than the highest the ship can equip is not possible, producing an Incompatible Slot error.

### Hyperspace Fuel Equation

The Frame Shift Drive (SCO) use the same equation for hyperspace jumps as standard Frame Shift Drives, however the linear constant for drive rating uses different values.

| Rating | A | B | C | D | E |
| ---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Linear Constant | 13 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 8 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

E-rated SCO Frame Shift Drives match the jump range of a C-rated Sirius FSD, while C and B ratings match an A-rated Sirius FSD. The D and A ratings offer greater jump range than an A-rated Sirius FSD for different reasons; the D rating has a lower mass (except for class 2D), while the A rating has a higher optimised mass and max fuel per jump stats.

## Specifications

Unlike Frame Shift Drives, you can only install a Frame Shift Drive (SCO) if its size class matches the size of your ship's Frame Shift Drive Internal Compartment.

## V1 Pre-Engineered SCO Drives

You can purchase a pre-engineered SCO drive available in all sizes from human tech brokers. Once purchased, the drive will be located in the station's storage. As it is not an unlock, subsequent drives will need to to be purchased again. Each purchase requires materials and a Titan Drive Component.

These drives have both Faster Boot Sequence and Increased Range applied, giving the full benefits of both. It is normally impossible to apply two different blueprints to a single module. This results in an approximate 10% jump range increase (actual increase varies by ship mass and drive size). An experimental effect can be applied to these drives at an FSD engineer, as with normal engineering.

CMDRs received one of every class (2A-7A) V1 SCO FSD for their help in fighting and destroying Titan Cocijo on Dec 18 3310.
