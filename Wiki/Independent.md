## Independent systems

The majority of the Core Systems and other human-inhabited territories such as the Pleiades Nebula and Colonia Region consists of unaligned, independent systems. Independent systems have rich and diverse cultures, politics, and beliefs, and generally rely on locally-funded and trained security forces for protection. The main appeal for remaining independent is the freedom of self-governance and the new opportunities in uncharted, deep space. These systems are generally less populated and secure, but not necessarily anarchic.^[1]^

### Population

The total population of all independent systems in the galaxy is 2,477,835,166,138 as of April 3306.^[2]^
