**Toxic Waste** is a Waste Commodity that can be salvaged from System Signal Sources, or pirated from traders. It is considered illegal in all inhabited systems, and transporting it can result in a fine or bounty if scanned by system security.

Toxic Waste has no market value anywhere, including in Black Markets, although some missions will reward pilots for smuggling it. It is extremely volatile, and while stowed in any Cargo Rack, it will continuously damage ship modules.
