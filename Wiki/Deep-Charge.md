# Deep Charge
> 
> 
> Toughened FSD power conduits and a reinforced charging field increase the amount of fuel injected when charging, allowing larger jumps at the cost of increased power draw.

**Deep Charge** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to Frame Shift Drives through Engineering. It increases maximum fuel consumption per jump by 10% to boost overall jump range, but increases power draw by 5%.

Deep Charge is most beneficial for Class 4 and lower FSDs; for Class 5 and higher FSDs, Mass Manager is more suitable. It is recommended for explorers and ships with low jump range.

## Applicability

The effect is available for the following modules:

- Frame Shift Drive

## Required Materials

- 5x Atypical Disrupted Wake Echoes
- 3x Galvanising Alloys
- 1x Eccentric Hyperspace Trajectories
