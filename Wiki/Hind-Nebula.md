Hind Nebula and a planet
 		 	 

The **Hind Nebula** (NGC 1555) is a reflection nebula located in the constellation Taurus, roughly 600 light years from Sol. It was discovered by John Russell Hind on October 11, 1852. 

The Hind Nebula is the smallest nebula known in the Elite Dangerous galaxy. From a distance of 25 light years it appears as an orange halo surrounding the T Tauri star. From inside it's a bright orange "shell" surrounding the bright star.

There's an Asteroid Base called the Hind Mine in the system T Tauri.
