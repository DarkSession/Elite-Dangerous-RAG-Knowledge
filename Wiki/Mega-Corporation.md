**Mega corporations** are massive conglomerates of multiple corporations with different businesses that are part of larger corporate groups. A mega corporation can be a parent company with many subsidiaries, or a set of companies with interlocking business relationships and shareholdings.^[1]^ In the 34th century, the planet-spanning mega corporations employ entire nations and rule unchecked over vast sections of the galaxy.^[2]^ They are not above the law, but they hold a very wide remit as far as what they are permitted to do in the name of profit concerns.^[3]^  

The mega corporations are super-rich and super-powerful with innumerable subsidiaries in multiple industries. They are huge, interstellar and operate in many star systems. They conduct various operations like manufacturing, farming, mining, tourism, entertainment, energy, terraforming and utilize entire planets and star systems. Entire worlds are gouged for minerals and foods. These corporations and their drive for growth are essential for providing basic goods and technology for trillions of people in the galaxy.^[2]^ Apart from a few isolated backwater systems, the presence of mega-corporations is ubiquitous throughout civilised space.^[4]^
