## Timeline

15 FEB 3304

- Imperial Senator Gianna Tachibana offered an assessment to The Imperial Herald as questions mounted about the apparent lack of an effective military response to the Thargoids: "The Pleiades is at risk of becoming a no-go zone, accessible only to the most courageous pilots. The formation of militias of independent pilots has unquestionably had an impact, as has the advantage afforded by Aegis's ongoing research. But one cannot escape the feeling that humanity is being reactive, rather than proactive. What is needed is a comprehensive military strategy. The time for a coordinated response is now."^[1]^
