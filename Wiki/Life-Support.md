**Life Support** is a module that continuously provides breathable atmosphere within a ship as long as it is powered and activated. The rating of Life Support also determines the size of the reservoir of air that can be stored in the pilot's suit. In the event that Life Support is rendered inoperable or the ship's canopy is breached, the pilot's Remlok Survival Mask will automatically activate and begin drawing from the suit reservoir. The reservoir can be replenished at any port by docking and fully entering a hangar; in the case of Starports and Asteroid Bases, the ship only needs to cross the Access Corridor threshold and enter the docking bay to stop consuming the reservoir. Pilots can also use Iron and Nickel to synthesize Life Support refills on the go, which may be enough to keep them alive until they can repair at a port.
