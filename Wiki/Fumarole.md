Silicate Fumarole
 		 	 

A **fumarole** is an opening in a planet's crust that allows gases and dissolved minerals from deep below the surface to eject into the surroundings or deposit around the sides of the openings.^[1]^ Fumaroles can be found in various places on terrestrial planets and moons. Fumaroles can be detected from orbit using a Detailed Surface Scanner to identify geologically-active areas where they are likely to occur.

The Codex has two categories: *fumarole* and *ice fumarole*. The Regular fumaroles tend to be large and round.

## Notes

- Prior to *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*, the Detailed Surface Scanner identified specific sites with fumaroles and other geological phenomena as "Geological Sites", which would be clearly marked and numbered for ease of navigation.
- Prior to *Elite Dangerous: Beyond* Chapter 4, explorers would document the planetary body, latitude, and longitude of geyser locations for later reference. Manual discovery of these locations could take many hours or even days. Chapter 4's improvements to discovery tools enabled automatic logging of these locations in the Codex for easy reference. An unfortunate side effect of that update is that some classic geological locations were erased or heavily modified.
