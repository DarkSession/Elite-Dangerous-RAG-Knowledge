### Premium items

Occasionally, a Pioneer Supplies store may offer premium items for sale. These unique exclusive items are meant for the most enthusiastic clients.^[2]^ Premium suits and weapons are between Grade 2 and Grade 5 in quality, and may have one or more Engineering modifications already attached. They cost substantially more than unmodified Grade 1 suits and weapons. Once a unique exclusive item is purchased from a specific Pioneer Supplies store, it is sold out.^[2]^ So the premium item is unavailable for other commanders at that specific store.^[2]^ Restocking of premium items happens once per week, usually on Thursday.
