### Atmospheric landing and on-foot activities

The landmark feature of *Odyssey* is the addition of the ability to explore planets on foot. This is permitted not only on all non-atmospheric landable planets, but *Odyssey* also adds atmospheric landing on planets with tenuous or thin atmospheres for the first time, increasing the number of available landable bodies in the game by over 20%. Landing on planets with tenuous atmospheres requires the new Advanced Planetary Approach Suite module. On Foot activities require a suit to protect the player from the hostile environment, but some planets are so inhospitable that players cannot disembark from their ships even if their ships are able to land.^[5]^^[6]^ In order to disembark from a ship on foot, the player must first land the ship on the ground.^[7]^ A planet's gravity is also a factor during On Foot activities, and can affect the player's movement, jumping, and their thrown grenades.^[8]^

The first player to set foot on a planet will receive the "First Footfall" credit on the System Map. First Footfall credit can only be claimed on planets in systems with 0 population; inhabited systems have already been explored at some point in the *Elite Dangerous* universe's 1300-year history of interstellar exploration, and thus First Footfall credit in those systems is already long claimed. Unlike the "First Discovered" and "First Mapped" credits, "First Footfall" credit is recorded immediately upon a player dismebarking on a previously unclaimed body, and does not require selling scan data to Universal Cartographics.^[6]^

Millions of older planets have refreshed visuals with new levels of detail. Each sunset feels unique with a new algorithm that factors in the composition of the planetary atmosphere, the color, distance of the nearby stars, and other variables. New living creatures are distributed across the galaxy based on complex, in-fiction rules and logic. These biologicals (flora and vegetation) can be located from orbit. The player can then land to sample their genomes, and return to a starport and exchange those discoveries for credits and buy upgrades. Player names are permanently attached to the things they discover.^[9]^

Players can explore both settlements and crashed ships, as well as Guardian and Thargoid sites.^[10]^

*Odyssey* also introduces a multi-layered tactical environment in which commanders (on foot), SRVs, and ships can engage in combat with each other simultaneously. With Multicrew, multiple commanders aboard the same ship can deploy on foot, in an SRV, and in a Ship-Launched Fighter all at the same time. Ship weapons cannot target commanders because they are too small to target, but commanders can use certain handheld weapons to target ships. SRVs can damage commanders by running over them, but ships cannot ram commanders.^[7]^

In the event a player is critically injured while on foot, where they redeploy is determined by their location and whether or not they own a ship. Players who do not own a ship will redeploy at the nearest Concourse. Players who own a ship and used it to travel to the planet where they were injured may choose to redeploy aboard that ship, which will be automatically relocated to a safe orbit above the planet, or the nearest Concourse. Players who own a ship but left it at a port will redeploy aboard that ship at that port.^[8]^ Players also lose any items in their suit's backpack when they are injured, but not equipped tools or weapons.^[10]^

### Concourses

 	 	[![Concourse Interior ED](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/6a/Concourse_Interior_ED.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20241228215740)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/6a/Concourse_Interior_ED.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20241228215740) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Concourse interior
 		 	 

Starports, orbital Outposts, Asteroid Bases, and Planetary Ports are home to new Concourses, public common areas where players can meet with each other, take on missions, purchase equipment and ships, exchange or sell certain commodities, and redeem discoveries. All Concourses provide access to seven different vendors, each offering a unique service. Players can even travel from one Concourse to another, or to settlements, without the need for their own ship via Apex Interstellar Transport's shuttle service.^[11]^^[12]^^[13]^ Players can also participate in large ground battles through Frontline Solutions.^[10]^

### Equipment

On-foot activities require new equipment types: suits, consumables, and handheld weapons and tools. The player can change the suit and equipment while aboard their ship or SRV.^[10]^ The player's suit includes a specialised HUD interface.

There are four different suit models, each optimized for a different type of activity. The basic Flight Suit used by pilots is the least versatile and resilient of the four, but is safe enough for venturing out of the ship. Premium suits include the Maverick Suit, designed for scavenging, the Artemis Suit, designed for exploration, and the Dominator Suit, designed for combat. All suits possess shields and life support systems which are maintained by a battery with a finite charge; the player can adjust the power distribution for these systems. Suits also have varying backpack capacities; the Maverick has the most amount of space, while the Dominator has the least. Lastly, suits can be cosmetically customized with different skins.^[11]^^[8]^^[10]^

Handheld weapons and tools allow the player battle other players and NPC or defensive emplacements, and interact with the enviroment. Weapon types include assault rifles, rocket launchers, shotguns, sniper rifles, carbines, pistols, and three types of grenades, including Frag Grenades, EMP Grenades, and Shield Grenades. The first weapon that players receive is a pistol.^[14]^ Tools include the Genetic Sampler, which is used to take samples of organisms that can be sold to Vista Genomics, the Arc Cutter, which can open panels and carve new pathways inside settlement buildings, the Energylink, which can drain power from or overload devices, and the Profile Analyser, which can scan targeted individuals and clone security authorisation profiles. Tools are tied to the type of suit the player is wearing. The Maverick Suit is equipped with the Arc Cutter, Energylink, and Profile Analyser, the Artemis Suit is equipped with the Genetic Sampler, and the Manticore Dominator eschews tools in favor of carrying a second primary weapon and extra grenades.^[8]^

The corporations Kinematic Armaments, Manticore, and Takada each specialize in handheld weapons that fire a certain type of projectile. Kinematic Armaments weapons fire kinetic rounds (very effective against armoured targets), Takada weapons fire lasers (very effective against shielded targets), and Manticore weapons fire plasma rounds (moderately effective against all targets). In addition, rocket launchers and grenades are explosive weapons that are especially effective against ships and SRVs.^[14]^^[8]^

All handheld weapons possess an aim-down-sight function. They can also be modified with a number of attachments, such as scopes, but replacing one attachment with another results in the loss of the old attachment. Players can own multiple copies of the same weapon, but can only carry a limited number of weapons when disembarking from their ships. Weapons have finite ammunition which can be replenished with consumable pickups found in the field. Players can drop ammunition and grenades for other players in their instance to pick up if desired.^[14]^ Other consumables include the Medkit and the E-Breach.^[8]^

Players can also collect new items: Components, Data, and Goods. These are variously used as mission objectives, a source of income, and materials for upgrading pilot equipment.

### Settlements

*Odyssey* added over 400,000 settlements to the galaxy.^[4]^ Settlements have an expanded range of functionality in *Odyssey*, as well as new layouts. There are over 16 new settlement types with distinct structures and room types. These are located on planets and moons with tenuous atmospheres. The type of settlement determines everything from its layout, the kind of NPCs present, the range of available activities and missions, and what items can be retrieved or stolen. The interiors of all settlement buildings have breathable atmospheres, which means players will not draw on their suit's life support while indoors. Players can interact with the local NPCs peacefully, such as through trade, or violently, such as by eliminating NPCs loyal to a hostile faction or engaging in piracy.^[15]^^[11]^ Players with a neutral or positive reputation with the minor faction that controls a settlement will be permitted to land at a settlement's Landing Pad or in its vicinity without triggering the settlement's defence turrets.^[10]^

Settlements can be found in one of nine different states, which further determine its contents. If a player attacks a populated settlement, the controlling minor faction will dispatch a squad of military-strength reinforcements. A player who massacres an entire settlement and manages to defeat all reinforcements will face severe consequences. Depopulated settlements will repopulate over time. Anti-ship defences also make aerial attacks on settlements dangerous to attempt unless players on the ground disable those defences first, either by deactivating them in a settlement's security center or shutting down a settlement's power plant. Players can also deactivate a settlement's power plant to unlock restricted areas that are normally sealed or steal the Power Regulator.^[16]^^[8]^^[10]^

NPCs at settlements are classified as either guards, who are armed and will investigate disturbances or attack detected hostiles, or civilians, who lack personal shields to protect themselves but can alert guards to intruders. When intruders or illegal activities are detected by an NPC, the player can kill that NPC to try and prevent them from contacting other NPCs and alerting them. Certain actions such as shutting down a settlement's power plant will trigger a general alert across the settlement, but it still takes time for guard NPCs to gather at the reactor building to investigate the problem.^[8]^

### Stellar Forge improvements

 	 	[![ED-Horizons-Odyssey-Qa&#39;wakana-7-A](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/e/ea/ED-Horizons-Odyssey-Qa%27wakana-7-A.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/300?cb=20210601060645)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/e/ea/ED-Horizons-Odyssey-Qa%27wakana-7-A.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20210601060645) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Qa'wakana-7-A in ED Horizons and Odyssey
 		 	 

The Stellar Forge (SF) has been upgraded with terrains and terrain materials of various different types and scales which are deterministically selected and blended together depending on the SF-driven properties of that planet. Land-able planets are classified between rocky, icy, rocky ice, high metal content and metal rich depending on what emerges from the SF, but their terrains are dependent on those simulation values more than these discrete titles. Terrain shapes, styles, and combinations are mixed together, meaning there is a lot of variation within these classes.^[17]^^[18]^

Across a planet there is now a large scale mask processed which determines different zones of types of terrain based. The mask depends on things like how gravitationally stressed the planet is, the crust thickness and if the planet is, or has been, tectonically active. These zones mask out further subzones of terrain and material types, and follow the flow patterns laid out by the layer above it, creating a seamless landscape across the planet.^[17]^^[18]^

New occlusion systems. New tech will enable identifying areas and features of planets, the type of terrain, basins, craters, etc from orbit/space. Distinct regions are blended together such as flat and mountainous areas. Planets now use a mix of procedural features and pre-baked, hand-crafted assets, all blended together. Scatter system for rocks, flora, etc will be more systemic and deterministic for each planet, so that assets are in a more natural place. Multiple geomes are supported, so planets can have mixed-combinations of surfaces: dusty, rocky, icy, snowy, etc. Most of the game has graphical changes, which includes the stars.^[19]^

Use of a new Physically Based Rendering system throughout the game gives stars a new "light". Different planets' atmospheres will have different colours based on their primary composition. For example atmosphere colours/types: red, yellow, green, blue, lots of shades. Raleigh scattering for light refraction based on the star light's wavelength and planet atmosphere density. Mie scattering for light absorption based on atmosphere elements and composition. Oxygen, Argon, Neon, etc. absorb light differently. This produces a huge variety of visual possibilities.^[19]^

Hints at more landable planets to come, only tenuous atmosphere planets have been unlocked for Odyssey's launch.^[19]^

### Storyline

Odyssey doesn't include a single-player, story-driven campaign. The tutorial for On Foot gameplay has voice acting and objectives.^[4]^ However, there is a persistent Background Simulation and political backdrop via Powerplay and Galnet News. The community influences events via community goals and other activities such as the Second Thargoid War and the creation of the Colonia Bridge.

### Other additions and changes

- Two new Pilots Federation Ranks: Mercenary and Exobiologist.
- With *Odyssey*, the Standard Docking Computer and Advanced Docking Computer can detect suitable landing sites and automatically land ships on planetary surfaces. Previously, these modules were only capable of automatically docking ships with Landing Pads at Stations and Surface Ports, and landing on planetary surfaces required manual control from the player.^[8]^
- Various ship-related visual enhancements, including exterior details and textures, shield impact cues, explosions resulting from a ship's destruction, the hyperspace jump animation, and Pulse Wave Analyser scanning graphics.
- Redesigns for the Mission Board, Galaxy Map, System Map, Shipyard, and the Redeployment interface.
- 4 new and variant ships with new designs and capabilities in 2024. The Python Mk II is a variant of the Python. The early access release was in May 2024. The Type-8 Transporter is a freighter by Lakon Spaceways. Early access started in August 2024.^[20]^ The 3rd and 4th ships are the Mandalay and the Cobra Mk V.
- Frame Shift Drive (SCO)
- New vehicle: Scorpion
- New Thargoid craft: Thargoid Hunter, Thargoid Titan
- New Thargoid drones: Banshee, Revenant
- Thargoid Maelstrom, Thargoid Spire
- The Detailed Surface Scanner gains a series of filters to allow players to isolate various geological and biological features on planetary surfaces.
- 9 new Engineers, and new modifications for Suits and Handheld Weapons.^[4]^
- In addition to the new settlements, over 8,000 Surface Ports were added to worlds with tenuous atmospheres.^[4]^
- 5 new post-Elite ranks called "Elite Stars" added to all six rank ladders (Combat, Trader, Explorer, CQC, Mercenary, Exobiologist).^[4]^
- Odyssey supports 6 languages for the interface and full audio: English, French, German, Russian, Spanish (Spain), Portuguese (Brazil).^[21]^

## Music

The original soundtrack of Odyssey was composed by Dan Millidge and published on 29 May 2021. It has 39 tracks and a total length of 67 minutes. The songs are played during Odyssey specific gameplay in addition to the original Elite Dangerous Music. It is available at the Frontier Store and Steam.

## Alpha

 	 	[![Odyssey alpha schedule](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/15/Odyssey_alpha_schedule.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20210325212216)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/15/Odyssey_alpha_schedule.png/revision/latest?cb=20210325212216) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
The initial roadmap for *Odyssey* alpha phases
 		 	 

The *ED: Odyssey* PC alpha ran from 29 March 2021 to 5 May 2021.^[8]^^[23]^ Access to the alpha could be obtained through purchasing the *Odyssey* Deluxe Alpha edition or owning the Lifetime Expansion Pass. Over the course of the alpha, *Odyssey* features were introduced incrementally in order to focus community feedback.^[3]^

- **Phase 1: First Steps**(29 March - 8 April)
    - During the first phase of the alpha, all participants were given a fresh commander profile and began at Armstrong's Legacy in the Adityan system. Players were restricted to Adityan for this phase to maximise player interaction and stress-test the game's network.
    - The Maverick Suit, and Kinematic Armaments and Takada weapons could be purchased.
    - Players did not have access to ships, but could travel using Apex Interstellar Transport to reach groundside mission locations.
    - Salvage and collection/delivery missions were available.

- **Phase 2: Combat**(8 April - 15 April)
    - The starting point of the alpha was moved to the Nervi system.
    - A 20ly bubble of space surrounding Adityan, which included Nervi, was opened up for interstellar travel, and players could purchase ships. All players were granted a Cobra Mk III to start with.
    - The Dominator Suit could be purchased.
    - Faction conflicts were enabled and combat missions at Conflict Zones were available through Frontline Solutions.
    - Several fixes and improvements based on Phase 1 feedback were added.

- **Phase 3: Exploration**(15 April - 28 April)
    - The bubble of playable space was expanded to 50ly, allowing players to visit unexplored planets and test the "First Footfall" discovery mechanic.
    - The Artemis Suit could be purchased.
    - The Genetic Sampler tool was enabled, allowing exobiology gameplay.

- **Phase 4: Compatibility**(28 April - 5 May)
    - A snapshot of players' main commander profiles taken on April 23, 2021 was added to the alpha. Players had access to their owned ships and funds. Normal ship transfer costs and wait times were reduced so players could transfer their ships into the playable 50ly zone.
    - All base game features were enabled to test their compatibility with *Odyssey* features. Fleet Carriers were enabled belatedly on April 30.

## Compatibility

 	 	[![Odyssey compatibility chart 2](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/bb/Odyssey_compatibility_chart_2.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20210519010923)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/bb/Odyssey_compatibility_chart_2.png/revision/latest?cb=20210519010923) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Horizons/Odyssey compatibility
 		 	 

*Elite Dangerous* was updated to reunite both branches of the game. *Odyssey* and *Horizons* players can instance with each other, though *Horizons* players cannot land on planets with tenuous atmospheres because they are not able to obtain the required Advanced Planetary Approach Suite. However, *Horizons* players can experience the graphical update and planet-generation improvements of *Odyssey*.^[24]^^[25]^

Due to the addition of first-person shooter gameplay in *Odyssey*, it was given a higher age restriction rating than the *Elite Dangerous* base game by the PEGI. As a result, players who own *Odyssey* are blocked from instancing on non-atmospheric landable worlds with players who do not own *Odyssey*.^[26]^

### Consoles

Development of the console version of Odyssey was officially cancelled on 10 March 2022.^[27]^ This means Odyssey will not be released on old-gen consoles. 

The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have the Legacy version (v3.8 Game Client) of the game. This legacy version received no further updates (narrative and gameplay) since the end of the Azimuth Saga. Ships that were released afterward are unavailable on consoles.

The new ships are only available in Live mode (v4.0 Game client) of ED. These ships are available with only the base game and optionally the Odyssey expansion. Upon the initial release of new ships such as the Mandalay, Python Mk II and the Type-8, players can buy 3-months early-access for ARX. After 3 months the standard editions of these ships will be available for free for all players with the base game (v4.0+).

### Migration to PC

### Windows 7

On 17 August 2022, compatibility with Windows 7 was cancelled in order to *"continue focus on providing the best experience for the more commonly used systems."*^[30]^

### Console Profile Transfer Portal

### Geforce Now

## Development

Base arrive concept art
 		 	 

Development of *Odyssey* started in August 2018 and was officially announced on 3 June 2020.^[1]^ *Odyssey's* internal codename was "Watson".^[36]^

On 15 November 2019 Frontier described the new era of Elite in a Trading Statement and Roadmap Update:

*"The future for Elite Dangerous is also exciting. Frontier is developing a major new paid-for release for the iconic space simulation which will dramatically expand gameplay and mark the beginning of a new era for Elite Dangerous. This will be characterised by significant new features to appeal to existing commanders, whilst being specifically designed to be a compelling, attractive and welcoming entry point for new players. Targeted for launch at the end of 2020, this major new release on multiple platforms will fall into financial year 2021."*^[37]^

 	 	[![ED-Odyssey-bar-area-concept](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/72/ED-Odyssey-bar-area-concept.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20200604221316)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/72/ED-Odyssey-bar-area-concept.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200604221316)

Frontier said on 1 March 2019:*"Back in August (2018), we mentioned that the team had begun work on the next major era of Elite. We believe this will be a defining moment in the history of the game and it will be our biggest update yet."*^[2]^

*"In that post, we explained that the content was still very early in development, so we won’t be ready to announce it for a while. To give this more context, in order to realise the ambition for this update, and the size and scope of the content we wish to bring to the Elite Dangerous galaxy, we estimate this major milestone will be ready by the latter half of 2020."*^[2]^

*"As development progresses, we will share more news and announcements on features, as well as timelines regarding this upcoming content for Elite. We can understand that having a long wait for news can be frustrating, but we truly believe that this will be the single most impactful update for our community. Having a development team dedicated to this milestone is our continued and unwavering commitment to making Elite Dangerous the most authentic, ambitious, and expansive evolving space game in the world."*^[2]^

On 22 October 2019, Community Manager Will Flanagan said: *"The team have been hard at work on the next major milestone, which you may remember we mentioned back in March as our next major paid addition to the game. They’re making fantastic progress and on schedule for release by the end of next year. We are very excited to show you what we’ve been working on. However, we can only announce the content when it’s at the right stage of development, we estimate this will be ready to talk about at some time in summer 2020, after the Fleet Carriers update. We appreciate there is a bit of a wait, but we want to make sure it is ready to be shown before making our full official announcement to the world."*^[38]^

On 3 June 2020, less than a week before the release of the Fleet Carriers Update, a trailer for the expansion containing in-engine pre-alpha footage and revealing its name as *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey* was accidentally uploaded to the official *Elite Dangerous* YouTube channel. Although the trailer was swiftly removed, copies of it were captured and uploaded by fans, and Frontier Developments eventually decided to advance their announcement plans and reveal *Odyssey* the same day.^[1]^

## Launch

*Odyssey* was originally scheduled to release simultaneously on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation in December 2020. However, development suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic and was delayed to early 2021.^[39]^ COVID-19 restrictions in the United Kingdom delayed the release a second time. The PC version of *Odyssey* finally launched on 19 May 2021.^[3]^^[4]^

The 1.0 launch version of Odyssey received generally mediocre review scores from the press with an average rating 55/100.^[40]^ On 23 May 2021, the user review scores dropped to 30% positive out of 2,055 reviews.^[41]^ The main reasons that users gave for their disapproval were a plethora of technical issues, poor optimization, low performance and bugs.^[42]^ By September 2021, the Steam user reviews score improved to 37%.^[42]^

The CEO of Frontier, David Braben, personally responded to the rocky launch of *Odyssey* in two posts on the Frontier Forums that outlined issues players were experiencing and Frontier's plans to address them:

In September 2021, Frontier Developments reported a 19% rise in revenue since its existing game franchise portfolio continued to perform well. Player engagement has gradually improved in the ED community after the botched release of *Odyssey*.^[43]^

The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of *Odyssey* were officially cancelled on 10 March 2022.^[27]^ Frontier refocused exclusively on the PC version and ceased development of new content on consoles.^[27]^

Frontier Developments released a series of updates and hotfixes in the weeks after the *Odyssey* launch to correct the large number of issues reported by players, and address feedback about ways to improve *Odyssey* features and changes.^[44]^^[45]^ A roadmap of patches was provided for the month of June 2021, ending with Update 5.^[46]^ From there, Frontier planned to turn its focus to the rollout of *Odyssey* on consoles, but would continue to provide improvements to the PC version.^[47]^

On 12 July 2021, Frontier reiterated its post-launch priorities for *Odyssey*, explaining that they had decided to focus on further improvements to the PC version, and push the console release back indefinitely until the PC version had reached an acceptable state. More patches for the PC version were planned for the remainder of 2021, beginning with Update 6.^[48]^ It was confirmed on 26 July that beginning with Update 6, small content additions and gameplay changes were also planned for future *Odyssey* updates.^[49]^

### Developer Updates and clarification posts

## Roadmap

 	 	[![ED Odyssey Roadmap 2022](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/c/c6/ED_Odyssey_Roadmap_2022.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20220505081441)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/c/c6/ED_Odyssey_Roadmap_2022.png/revision/latest?cb=20220505081441) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Odyssey Roadmap for 2022
 		 	 

### 2022

On 4 May 2022, Frontier released a top-level roadmap for 2022. The three focuses were launching the next phase of the narrative, stability and optimisation via 3 updates. Within the narrative, human space balances on the precipice as tension mounted within the Bubble. The Azimuth Saga concluded in a grand finale event, the consequences marked the beginning of the next stage of the Elite story in Update 14. Meanwhile, updates 12 and 13 largely focused on quality-of-life changes, stability and optimisation. Work also began on a major feature overhaul for 2023. Additional game content would be revealed once it's confirmed.^[28]^

## Performance

Odyssey system requirements
 		 	 

*Odyssey* has higher system requirements than *Elite Dangerous* and *Horizons*. *Odyssey* owners who experience low frames per second (FPS) or stuttering should first verify that their PC meets the system requirements and update their GPU drivers. Other possible solutions are listed below.

### Reset graphics

If problems persist, the following procedure may improve the game's performance and is officially recommended by Frontier Developments:^[58]^^[59]^

1. Navigate to this file location: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Graphics
2. Make a backup of every file in the graphics folder, and place it somewhere safe for future reference.
3. Delete the original files in the Graphics folder.
4. Restart the game.

### Drivers

Some CMDRs report considerable performance boosts in Odyssey by doing these:

### Graphics settings

- Set Vsync to off. The GPU does unnecessary extra work on rendering frames that are never shown to the user. If you do set VSync to off, make sure to set a FPS limit (or on NVidia, use the other VSync options, like 'fast'), otherwise you would fry your GPU.
- Turn FX to "OFF". Turn Volumetric effects quality to low.
- Put the shadows to medium or low.

### Alpha files

For *Odyssey* owners who pre-ordered and played the alpha version, the alpha file PUBLIC\_TEST\_SERVER\_0D can be deleted to free up 46 gigabytes of space.^[60]^

### Orange Sidewinder fix

^[61]^

1. Open the Elite Dangerous Steam launcher.
2. Select Options &gt; Validate Game Files.
3. You should now be able to play.

**Additional Step:**

- *AS AN ADDITIONAL step to try, some success has been found by disabling the Elite Dangerous Cache prior to validating:*
    1. **Steam** &gt; Settings from the top left client menu.
    2. In the Settings panel, select the **Downloads** tab and you'll find the "**Clear Download Cache**" button at the bottom.
    3. Then select "OK" to confirm and acknowledge that you'll need to login to **Steam** again.

We currently believe that the reason why loading screen timeouts and 'Orange Sidewinders' are occurring, is because some of the resource files for Odyssey appear to have initially deployed to Steam incorrectly, during the update process. 

- Tip: Disable Virtual Cache in the options before verifying the files, not doing so can slow down the process a lot on slow PC's. Also, it may take a while for the launcher to get past "preparing for update" (20+ min on old hard disks (it's less than a minute on NVMe). I didn't disable the cache but I also have a very fast M.2 NVMe drive.

## Mods

### Graphics mods

Check the graphics mods if you want to increase the planetary and space details beyond the highest in-game settings.

### Anti-aliasing

ED Odyssey does not support good anti-aliasing to reduce jagged edges. However, the best way to improve this is by setting the in-game graphics to use **X2.0 Supersampling,** then turn **FSR and Fidelity off**.^[63]^ This may reduce the framerate. If you want a higher FPS then use X1.5 Supersampling. 

## VR

*ED: Odyssey* is not VR compatible in on-foot activities since launch. There are currently no definite plans to bring VR to *Odyssey*, but it has not been ruled out.^[64]^^[65]^ This was announced 8 months in advanced.^[13]^ VR remains available while piloting a ship.^[13]^

### VR mod

1. Get into Camera Suite
2. Press the "Enter Free Camera" button in sequence but very quickly (called "plinking" if you're familiar with fighting game terminology).
3. This will free up the camera, enable full VR walking with crouch and head bob.

## Notes

- Contrary to alleged leaks and rumours,^[69]^ *Odyssey* does not include the ability explore the interior of one's ship on foot,^[13]^
- Access to the alpha and full version of Odyssey are included in the Lifetime Expansion Pass.^[64]^

## Vehicles

These are the vehicles that were added with Odyssey and updates:

### Ground Vehicles

- Surface Recon Vehicles
    - Scorpion

### Spacecraft

- Ships
    - Cobra Mk V
    - Corsair
    - Mandalay
