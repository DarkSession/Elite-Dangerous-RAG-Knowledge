The **Shutdown Field Neutraliser** is an experimental utility module created by Elvira Martuuk for Aegis. Released on October 19, 3303, the Shutdown Field Neutraliser protects human ships from the temporary incapacitation caused by Thargoid Interceptor shutdown fields when activated. They can be purchased at military and high tech planetary bases.

## Specifications

> 
> 
> When active, Shutdown Field Neutralisers create interference that matches the frequency of known Xeno overload wave technology, the result of which almost fully neutralises the effect on human vessels. The field needs to be maintained for the duration of the overload wave, and will quickly drain SYS energy from power distributors due to its high energy requirements. Once power has been drained, it will require an amount of time to recharge for another use.
