# Telepresence
Holo-Me Hologram
 		 	 

**Telepresence** is a set of technologies which allow an individual to remotely project a holographic facsimile of themselves to a location other than the site of their physical body. In the 34th century, this is used to remotely join other pilots' ships and control Ship-Launched Fighters.

## Usage

Telepresence can only be used in ships that are equipped with hologram emitter technology. Generally, a vacant pilot seat is required. The telepresence connection between the true physical location of a person and another ship can become unstable and occasionally disconnect if the distance is great enough.

Pilots cannot remotely assume helm control of another full-sized ship, but Ship-Launched Fighters can be remotely controlled as long as they remain near the mothership to maintain their connection. This is a deliberate design limitation in place as a safety measure to guard against telepresence signal-hacking and the loss of ships due to signal interruption caused by extreme distances.

Holo-Me holograms appear realistic, but they are distinguishable from real people. The remote connection can be closed by the pilot at the helm of a ship. A Holo-Me hologram is not a physical person so it cannot be grabbed or touched. The range of where a Holo-Me projection can go is limited by the technology aboard a given ship.

### Ships

Pilots can remotely join the cockpit of other ships via telepresence. Multicrew uses Holo-Me technology to display a holographic representation of themselves in another ship.^[1]^^[2]^

### Ship-Launched Fighters

It is used to remotely control  Ship-Launched Fighters (SLF). The pilot is located in their ship and uses telepresence to virtually control the fighter. There's a range limit between the SLF and the mothership from where it launched to maintain a telepresence connection.

### Surface Recon Vehicles

The Scarab Surface Recon Vehicle has a weapon turret with an attached camera. The SRV driver can control this turret and see through the camera remotely from the driver pod.
