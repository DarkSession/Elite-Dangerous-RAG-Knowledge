# Ling Lang
A **Ling Lang** is a "notoriously ill-tempered" carnivore native to the Achenar system.^[1]^

Little else is known about them at this time, save that the Imperial Prince Aristide de Lavigny kept a Ling Lang as a pet in his own menagerie. The Prince was killed by the creature in unclear circumstances some time in the mid-3200s, leading to a number of conspiracy theories about what actually happened, none of which were true according to his wife.^[2]^
