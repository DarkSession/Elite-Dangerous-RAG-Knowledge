**Durius** is an Independent system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It was annexed by the Empire on January 22, 3301 after a conflict that was instigated when the system's government defaulted on a loan that had been granted to it by Senator Denton Patreus, but it later managed to regain its independence.

## History

In December 3300, the impoverished Durius system defaulted on the loan granted it by Imperial Senator Denton Patreus. Talks with Governor Xavier Malachai were to no avail and war was declared. Despite facing devastating odds, the Durius system fought back valiantly. Senator Patreus was ultimately victorious, despite facing a desperate opposition, and subsequently brought Durius into the fold as an Imperial system.^[1]^
