**Thermal Spread** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to modules through Engineering. For Frame Shift Drives and Thrusters it decreases thermal load whereas for Power Plants it lowers the heat efficiency value. The net effect for all is a lower heat generation.

This upgrade is useful for Silent Running builds, ships with heat problems, and explorers prone to overheating during fuel scooping.

## Applicability

This effect is available for the following modules:

- Power Plant
- Frame Shift Drive
- Thrusters

- 5x Grid Resistors
- 3x Vanadium
- 1x Heat Vanes

Frame Shift Drive

- 5x Atypical Disrupted Wake Echoes
- 3x Galvanising Alloys
- 1x Heat Vanes
- 3x Grid Resistors

Thrusters
