> Slavery is an important part of Imperial Society, providing labour for the Empire and a safety net for its citizens. Many Imperials will choose to sell themselves into a fixed period of slavery than face the embarrassment and dishonour of living with a debt.

**Imperial Slaves** are a Slavery Commodity. They are legal throughout most of the Empire, but illegal in almost all systems outside of it. Unlike conventional Slaves, Imperial Slaves are a recognized class within the Empire and are entitled to a variety of legal protections. The practice of Imperial Slavery is regulated by Imperial law and monitored by the Imperial Slavers Association. A single unit of Imperial Slaves consists of one cryostasis pod containing one Imperial Slave, their spare clothes and personal effects, life support, and ownership documentation.^[1]^
