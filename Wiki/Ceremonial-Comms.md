**Ceremonial Comms** are a type of signal source that contain non-hostile ships contracted for weddings and funerals. These ships broadcast various messages on public comms channels that can be picked up while traveling in supercruise.

Each Ceremonial Comms instance features between one and five ships flying in formation. The main ship is usually a Dolphin, Orca, Beluga Liner, or Type-9 Heavy designated "Wedding Barge" or "Funeral Ship" with multiple Sidewinder MkIs, Cobra MkIIIs, or Type-6 Transporters escorting it. Although Ceremonial Comms ships are non-hostile, they may occasionally come under attack from pirates; otherwise, this signal source is similar to a Convoy Dispersal Pattern.

## Spawn Locations

Ceremonial Comms can appear in shipping lanes and spheres of influence in any populated system.
