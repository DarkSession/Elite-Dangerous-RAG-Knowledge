**HIP 54530** is an independent system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It is the headquarters of Core Enterprises, a subsidiary of Core Dynamics created in June 3307 to absorb the remnants of Jupiter Division, a breakaway department of Core Dynamics led by Jupiter Rochester. Jupiter Division had seized control of HIP 54530 in February 3307 after infiltrating and taking over the system's original ruling faction, HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group, but was defeated by Federal proxy Silver Legal Group before it could realize its goal of establishing an independent corporate republic that would demonstrate to the people of the Federation that corporatocracy was superior to democracy. Access to HIP 54530 is restricted, and requires a permit that can only be obtained by becoming Allied with the Silver Legal Group minor faction in Ts'ao Tach.

## History

HIP 54530 was shrouded in mystery for years, as it was one of a subset of systems that were permit-locked but did not issue any permits. During this period, the system's permit holder was the HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group. It was later suspected by the Federal Intelligence Agency that at the time HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group obtained approval from the Pilots Federation to restrict access to the system, it had already been infiltrated by Jupiter Division operatives who sought to conceal from the public their gradual takeover of the minor faction.^[1]^

This changed in February 3307, when Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester directed departments of the corporation that were singularly loyal to him to relocate their assets and personnel to HIP 54530, a development precipitated by the exposure of Rochester as one of the primary conspirators in the sabotage of Starship One in 3301 during the trial of Federal Navy Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent. On February 5, HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group, which had been wholly subsumed by Rochester's loyalists, officially renamed itself Jupiter Division.^[2]^^[3]^ Jupiter Rochester, who had fled to HIP 54530 to evade arrest, announced in a Federation-wide broadcast on February 9 that he had assumed the position of Supreme Executive of Jupiter Division, which he described as an independent corporate republic that would demonstrate the superiority of corporate governance to the Federal populace.^[4]^^[5]^

To secure its presence in the system, Jupiter Division went to war with the Silver Legal Group, a local pro-Federation minor faction that viewed Jupiter Division as a criminal enterprise and wanted to bring Jupiter Rochester to justice, on February 11. The Supreme Executive directed his forces from the megaship Victory's Forge and issued a call for assistance in the conflict to the galactic community, while Director Theodore Sullivan of the Silver Legal Group deployed the Iron Wings of Justice and requested support from Federal auxiliaries. The Pilots Federation agreed to extend temporary system permits to pilots participating in the conflict. In addition to the war's outcome determing which faction would be the permit-holder, both sides also promised to reward their supporters with permanent system permits if they won, as well as a limited-time discount on outfitting at Northrop Enterprise.^[1]^ The fighting abated on February 18, with the Silver Legal Group declaring victory and being awarded control of HIP 54530's permit. While remnants of Jupiter Division fled to the nearby HIP 55014 system aboard Victory's Forge, Jupiter Rochester and thousands of his loyalists were arrested by the Federal Intelligence Agency. Arrangements were made for Jupiter Division's stolen Core Dynamics assets to be returned.^[6]^

Jupiter Division's saga did not end there. The faction repelled an attempt by Federal Navy forces to seize Victory's Forge, and popular support for Jupiter Rochester's vision grew over the following months. By June 2, 3307, Jupiter Division had relocated its megaship to Ts'ao Tach, reclaimed HIP 54530, and spread its influence to Chi-1 Hydrae and Karkinicha.^[7]^ However, Core Dynamics allied with Silver Legal Group to put an end to Jupiter Division once and for all. Between June 3 and June 10, Silver Legal Group thoroughly routed Jupiter Division's forces in Ts'ao Tach and secured a second, decisive victory. Jupiter Division and its remaining assets were folded into the Core Dynamics subsidiary Core Enterprises, which also assumed control of HIP 54530.^[8]^^[9]^

The Silver Legal Group faction was one of 14 permit-holding factions that entered into an agreement on November 24, 3307 to maintain so-called Gatekeeper megaships to preserve interstellar trade regardless of local political shifts. These Gatekeeper megaships would be permanently stationed in systems adjacent to their corresponding permit-locked systems to ensure that pilots could reliably obtain permits. Grasp of Unity was deployed in Ts'ao Tach as the Silver Legal Group's Gatekeeper megaship.^[10]^
