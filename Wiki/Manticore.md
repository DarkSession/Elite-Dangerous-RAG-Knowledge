## History

Established in 2990, Manticore was for many years associated solely with ship-based technology, making a name for itself as a manufacturer of cannons, missiles, and limpets. In recent years the company widened its remit to encompass personal defence. Manticore's successful range of plasma-based weaponry has cemented its reputation for quality designs and smart leadership.
