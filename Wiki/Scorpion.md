## Overview

Vodel's Scorpion SRV released on December 9, 3307, becoming the corporation's first new SRV model in many years. Its development began in 3305 shortly after Core Dynamics' acquisition of Vodel, which gave the latter's engineering teams an infusion of funds. The SRV's designers built it specifically for combat operations and troop support.^[1]^

The Scorpion is a Multicrew-capable combat SRV that is compatible with the Planetary Vehicle Hangar. Its increased firepower, armour, and shielding compared to the Scarab allows it to more readily confront Skimmers or On Foot personnel, and the addition of a second seat means it can hold both a driver and a gunner, although the driver can still assume control of the weapons if they are alone. The Scorpion's armament consists of two weapons: the Surge Repeater, a rapid-fire weapon that increases its fire rate and accuracy the longer it is fired, and the Aculeus Launcher, a missile launcher with both dumbfire and lock-on modes.^[2]^ However, the Surge Repeater's inaccuracy makes it non-ideal for most combat situations, with the Scarab's Plasma Repeater being much more efficient at taking out ground-based NPCs, and can do so from a longer (and safer) ranger than the Surge Repeater. Where the Scorpion shines is in anti-air, as it can deal major damage to ships, and even quickly destroy smaller ones such as the Sidewinder MkI and Hauler before they get out of range.

The enhanced combat capabilities of the Scorpion come at a cost: the Scorpion has half the cargo space of the Scarab, reduced speed and acceleration, and lacks the Scarab's Wave Scanner and booster jets. The Scorpion can only be purchased from surface ports with a Military economy.^[2]^

## Notes

- The Scorpion was added in *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey* Update 9 on December 9, 2021. Purchasing it requires owning *Odyssey*.^[2]^
- A second ground vehicle was first hinted at in the refreshed key art released in 2020 for *Elite Dangerous* to mark the fold-down of *Elite Dangerous: Horizons* into the base game, which displayed what appeared to be a variant of the Scarab with a large cannon. The Scorpion was first mentioned by name in *Elite Dangerous* game files.^[3]^ An early model of the Scorpion with a slightly different design and glossy black paintjob was datamined from files in the *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey* alpha.^[4]^ Frontier Developments later announced that a new two-seat combat SRV would be added in *Odyssey* Update 9, but did not disclose any further details.^[5]^^[6]^ The finalised version of the Scorpion was officially revealed on December 8, 2021 in the SRV Stunt Show community showcase.
