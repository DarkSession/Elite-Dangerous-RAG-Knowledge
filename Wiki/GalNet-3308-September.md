### Supply Mined Materials to Azimuth Biotech

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Azimuth Biotech has called on mining vessels to deliver raw materials to the Glorious Prospect megaship in the LHS 157 system.

The campaign was launched by the corporation’s acting CEO, Torben Rademaker:

“Our mission to continue developing anti-xeno technologies is currently hampered by a lack of resources to establish new facilities. Azimuth’s investment in the Proteus Wave project and related infrastructure was considerable. Meanwhile, the reckless actions of anarchists and political extremists have inhibited our recovery.”

“Generous credit payments are being offered for supplies of the following mined metals: cobalt, gallite and osmium. These can be delivered to the Glorious Prospect in the LHS 157 system.”

“With a suitably reinforced corporate infrastructure, Azimuth can regain its status as the premier organisation for xenological research in the core systems. Dedicated supporters will be granted access to the Mbooni system, should they not already have it.”

In recent weeks, Azimuth Biotech was forced to withdraw from the Maia, Merope and Qarato systems following a coordinated campaign by an organised group opposing Salvation. Currently the corporation maintains a single facility in Mbooni as well as Hind Mine starport in the T Tauri system.

### Empire Shifts Anti-Xeno Strategy

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval has made a public announcement for the first time since the Battle of HIP 22460.

In an address before the Senate, which was broadcast on all Imperial networks, she stated:

“Our endeavour in the HIP 22460 system was a noble one, born from our duty to defend Imperial citizens against the Thargoid threat. We honour the crews of the INV Audacious Dream, INV Illustrious Fortune and INV Paramount, as well as other auxiliaries and volunteers who fought against overwhelming odds. Their names will be remembered.”

“The disastrous outcome from the so-called coalition provides direction for our future. It is clear to me that the Empire must learn to trust its own military strength once again. Joint operations with the Alliance and Federation, and our reliance upon Salvation’s superweapon, were strategic errors that we cannot afford to repeat.”

“Henceforth, all inter-superpower projects will cease. I have commanded the Imperial Navy to focus exclusively on protecting the Empire’s borders against our enemies, regardless of their origin. Resources and finances allocated to external suppliers will be redirected internally, to corporations of Imperial origin. Our scientists and manufacturers will provide the means to shield our territory against Thargoid invasion.”

“To the people of the Empire: be assured that your safety is my highest priority. As your Emperor, I vow that we will endure as the strongest civilisation in history.”

### Remarkable ‘Lost Planet’ Rediscovered

The location of the first green gas giant ever recorded was a mystery for years, but it has now been found by a community of explorers.

Commander Kelly Eldridge initially made the discovery on the 23rd of May 3301, noting that it was “the strangest gas giant I've seen so far”. The vivid green bands in the planet’s atmosphere made it unique to explorers at the time, and these types of gas giant are still extremely rare. The unusual colouration is believed to be caused by free-floating radioplankton that absorb planetary radiation.

Unfortunately, astrographic data of the system was not retained by Eldridge, so its precise location was lost. But in early 3308, Commander Richard Fluiraniz M began gathering enthusiasts for the ‘At The Eldritch Gate’ expedition, to collectively search for the missing planet.

The mission involved analysing constellation patterns and interstellar gas clouds in the only available image taken by Eldridge. Pilots also retraced her path by tracking neutron stars with her discovery tag, which involved multiple ships sweeping across an enormous area within the Perseus Crags region.

A match for the green gas giant was eventually made on the 16th of August by Commander Orange!, who identified it as the seventh planet in the Shaulai DL-P d5-274 system. With the system name supplied, Universal Cartographics then verified that it was indeed the original submitted by Eldridge.

Cynthia Sideris, chairperson of Universal Cartographics, gave a public tribute to the expedition:

“For over seven years, astronomers have been unable to officially catalogue the very first green gas giant. Through hard work and perseverance it has finally been found, and the full story of Shaulai DL-P d5-274 7 can be recorded for posterity. We are indebted to the Independent Explorers Association and everyone who took part in this historic achievement.”

### Unexplained ‘Flare’ Detected in Deep Space

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Reports from independent explorers indicate that an unusual visual phenomenon has appeared in deep space.

A distant point of light, described as a reddish-orange flare with faint radial patterns, has been observed close to the Barnard's Loop nebula. It is thought to have appeared only recently. Universal Cartographics has confirmed that the location of this ‘flare’ does not match any previously catalogued stellar body or star.

Early attempts to verify these reports have noted a strange response when the same region of space is observed through a full spectrum system scanner (FSS). No definitive target can be isolated, but claims of a faint background noise generated by FSS audio converters have been asserted.

Commander Eva Llewellyn, speaking to Vox Galactica, remarked:

“I’m used to the FSS making all sorts of strange noises, but listening to this thing – comet, solar flare, whatever it is – gives me goosebumps. Something feels off, all right. The scanner tells me there’s nothing there, nothing to focus on. Can’t say I agree. Still, smarter people than me will figure out the truth of it all, I guess.”

At present, it is unknown if this is a naturally occurring stellar event. Pilots are attempting to gather more data, but as yet no authority or scientific body has provided any official analysis of the phenomenon.

### Experts Speculate on Thargoid Behaviour

The Thargoids’ resistance to the Proteus Wave in HIP 22460 has prompted discussion among academics in the field of xenology.

Professor Shamus Madigan of Olympus Village University published a paper in the scientific journal The Empirical, which included this extract:

“The Thargoids newly observed defence against a man-made superweapon, and their subsequent aggression, suggests a direct response to our tactics. Not only have they upgraded their technology, but also their behaviour has altered. Humanity is now a problem that must be dealt with.”

The Imperial Science Academy’s director of xenological studies, Ivano Colombera, responded to a press query with:

“My hypothesis is that the Thargoids’ ability to disrupt Guardian technology was first conceived millions of years ago during the Guardian/Thargoid conflict, and only now have they sought to redeploy it against our hybrid modules. Nevertheless, my division has been ordered to focus on developing practical countermeasures.”

Dr Jeong-Hui Shin, a senior member of the Holloway Bioscience Institute, outlined her viewpoint via the Rewired network:

“We should not assume that the Thargoids have consciously adapted to us, or even register us as an intelligent life-form. We may be no more than parasites to them. Perhaps their vessels are responding like biomechanical ‘antibodies’, automatically fighting against a particularly virulent strain of human infection in HIP 22460.”

## 06 SEP

### ‘Xeno-Peace’ Discussions Gain Momentum

Public debate around the Battle of HIP 22460 has seen the emergence of a grassroots movement that promotes communication with the Thargoids.

As militaries prepare for a protracted anti-xeno conflict, this alternative viewpoint has gained traction on social channels in multiple systems. Proponents believe that their governments should focus on finding ways to open a dialogue with the Thargoid species, and end hostilities using diplomatic means.

On Interstellar Communal Experience (ICE) platforms, some influential names have amplified the xeno-peace concept. In a recent ICE-cast, leading caster Joy Senne openly discussed the topic with her viewers:

“How do you end a war? Is it by fighting harder, building bigger weapons, wiping out everyone you can? No! Well, sometimes, I guess. But I guess Salvation blew that one, right? We shouldn’t just accept what our leaders are telling us – that the only way to end the Thargoid war is through military action.”

“So if you want peace, you learn to talk to the other side and find common ground. That’s why I’m fascinated by this Thargoid Advocacy Project, which is promoting ways to resolve this terrible situation through non-violent means. Millions of people have already signed up. What do you all think?”

The movement has received minor coverage in most newsfeeds. However, The Sovereign, which reports on events in independent systems, has dedicated several segments to the Thargoid Advocacy Project. Deputy editor Heimar Borichev regularly discusses the topic in his editorials:

“Pro-peacers are being ridiculed for wanting to talk to the aliens rather than shoot them. The experts claim it’s a waste of research trying to communicate with Thargoids. But better facts are out there. Listen to what Professor Tesreau has always said between the lines. Seek out theories that weren’t approved by your governments. Make up your own mind.”

In the Federation, a spokesperson for the Proactive Detection Bureau remarked:

“An increase in pro-xeno sentiment has been flagged by our algorithms, since such messages often include markers for potentially antisocial behaviour. There is currently no evidence that this is anything other than a countercultural social phenomenon, but our operatives are monitoring the situation.”

## 07 SEP

### Mahon Rebukes Imperial Isolationism

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has spoken out against Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval’s decree to suspend inter-superpower cooperation.

At a meeting of the Alliance Assembly, Mahon said:

“This hasty decision from Emperor Arissa will have dangerous repercussions for the core systems as a whole, not just those within the Empire. Now that the Thargoids have become more hostile than ever before, humanity should be uniting against this common enemy.”

“Let us not forget: the coalition of anti-xeno taskforces in HIP 22460 performed their duties admirably, despite the tragic conclusion. That degree of military coordination could and should be sustained, to a far broader scale.”

“The Sirius Treaty, which I proposed at the Galactic Summit in 3307, would have established anti-xeno operations as a cross-superpower priority. I can only imagine how much better prepared we would now be to combat the Thargoids. But there is still scope for governments and organisations to work more closely, as exemplified by our strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation.”

The Alliance, Federation and Marlinist Colonies have reported that the Empire is methodically closing down all collaborative projects. However, official diplomatic representation in non-Imperial territories has been maintained.

## 08 SEP

### Successful Mining Campaign Sustains Azimuth

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

A range of mined materials have been delivered to the LHS 157 system to help Azimuth Biotech create new facilities.

Captain Maxim Lagunov, in command of the Glorious Prospect megaship, announced:

“This is the second time in recent weeks that our cargo bays have been stocked with vital supplies to sustain Azimuth’s future. These shipments of cobalt, gallite and osmium will be distributed to our manufacturing teams, and we hope to construct new permanent facilities in good time.”

“Torben Rademaker has authorised us to release funds to all pilots who mined and delivered these materials. This initiative has played a major role in helping to rebuild the corporation and continue our important work.”

“The Glorious Prospect will remain in the LHS 157 system for now. Pilots who have contributed to this initiative will shortly receive a Mbooni system permit, providing individual contribution targets were met.”

With the destruction of the Bright Sentinel, the Prospect’s Deep outpost in Mbooni is currently the only supplier of Salvation’s pre-engineered Guardian gauss cannon, Guardian plasma charger and Guardian shard cannon.

## 12 SEP

### Thargoids Turn Attention to Inhabited Systems

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Swarms of Thargoid vessels have invaded the 42 n Persei, Chun Pindit and Tekkeitjal systems in an apparently coordinated attack.

Vox Galactica published this report by field correspondent Ernesto Rios:

“Since the Thargoids conquered HIP 22460 a month ago, their presence has gradually expanded in all directions. But these are the first inhabited systems to be invaded since the Proteus Wave incident, threatening a combined population of over seven million people.”

“The governing factions of these systems – Sirius Inc, SI Terraforming and Tekkeitjal Public Corporation, respectively – are expected to host defensive operations against the Thargoids. None are aligned to any superpower, and so have no formal navy to support these efforts.”

“As yet, none of the starports in 42 n Persei, Chun Pindit or Tekkeitjal have been directly attacked. Civilians have been instructed to remain calm but many are evacuating, fearful of the stations suffering caustic enzyme bombardment.”

“This is a notable difference from previous Thargoid incursions, and has led some military figures to theorise on the alien’s new strategic objectives.”

Defensive operations are being orchestrated from the starports Bennington's Rest, Samuda Terminal and Riemann Colony. Thargoid combat bonds can be handed in at these locations for increased credit rewards.

### Federation Monitors Pro-Xeno Activity

The Federal Intelligence Agency has warned of heightened interest in the Far God cult and groups considered sympathetic to the Thargoids.

Deputy Director Bethany Blake, who runs the Proactive Detection Bureau, delivered a public statement:

“We have confirmed a significant increase in communications between local chapters of the Far God religious order, which includes the sharing of unverified xenological data. The Thargoids’ victory in HIP 22460 seems to have caused unprecedented excitement among the cultists. At present, there is no evidence that they pose any danger to the public. However, we are concerned by a recent increase in citizens abandoning their conventional lifestyles to join the cult.”

“We have also noted the rising popularity of a civil movement that advocates diplomatic relations with the Thargoids. This rhetoric is being promoted by several high-profile media figures. There is currently no known connection between these ‘xeno-peace’ supporters and the Far God cult, but both groups are being closely observed for potential criminality.”

Dr Alfred Ulyanov, the leading academic authority on the Far God faith, submitted his observations to The Federal Times:

“Recent events in HIP 22460 have galvanised the cultists, but also seem to have triggered an element of discord among some. Worshippers are abandoning the orthodox hive-chapels and pledging themselves to the True Chapters sect, where the First Apostle is being hailed as a holy messenger of the Far God. My contacts inform me that the Testament megaship has despatched scouts to locate a more permanent home, likely to accommodate a wave of new converts.”

### Patreus Highlights Thargoid Tactics

Senator Denton Patreus, fleet admiral of the Imperial Navy, has discussed the Empire’s new priorities following the Battle of HIP 22460.

During an exclusive interview with the Eye on Achenar newsfeed, Patreus said:

“Her Majesty the Emperor has decreed that our military priority is to defend systems within the Empire. The Imperial Navy’s production and training facilities have increased their efforts to redress the loss of three Majestic-class interdictors, along with tens of thousands of naval crew.”

“I’ve conducted my own tactical analysis of what took place in the HIP 22460 system. Salvation’s interest in the area with historic Thargoid ruins was no coincidence, I feel. He was something of a showman, and planning a final victory in the aliens’ own territory fits what we know of his ambition.”

“The Thargoids attacked human fleets with ferocious intent, but the fact they never assaulted the Proteus Wave site strikes me as remarkable. Even when considering the stout resistance, we offered. There is saying among military strategists: Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.”

“In hindsight, it seems possible that the Thargoids allowed the Proteus Wave to be installed at their surface site, with the foreknowledge that they could turn the superweapon against us. Perhaps Salvation unknowingly constructed his own execution chamber.”

“I’m convinced that we face an alien intelligence with a strategic competence to match any human opponent. The Empire cannot underestimate this enemy ever again.”

## 14 SEP

### Xeno-Peace Activists: ‘We Are The Invaders’

The xeno-peace movement, which calls for communication with the Thargoids, has sought to rationalise the latest incursions.

Despite ongoing conflicts in the 42 n Persei, Chun Pindit and Tekkeitjal systems, Thargoid aggression has been attributed to defensive measures. Reports by journalists in those systems, which have focused on the increasingly aggressive Thargoid craft, have been labelled ‘propaganda’ endorsed by major media corporations.

The ‘Thargoid Advocacy Project’ - a label which many supporters of the movement use in calls to action - believes that the authorities must commit to establishing a dialogue with the aliens. Timothy Culver, a prominent activist for the xeno-peace cause, provided a statement to The Sovereign:

“The Thargoids did not invade our space. We invaded theirs. Entire nebulas and other regions have been inhabited by them for over a million years, but our leaders arrogantly assume these regions are human conquests. Thargoid defensive acts were countered by destroying countless numbers of their vessels, stealing their meta-alloy resources, and a recent attempt to inflict widespread slaughter upon their fleet.”

“These latest incidents are reprisals for the Proteus Wave, a weapon of mass destruction built within one of the Thargoids’ own surface sites. This was the second such attempt to massacre vast numbers of Thargoids, the first being the mycoid bioweapon used less than two centuries ago. Such acts of revenge are common in humanity’s own military past.”

“The Thargoids are responding via the only language our leaders understand: warfare. It’s time that we spoke a new language. Let’s start talking to our neighbours instead of aiming our weapons at them.”

## 15 SEP

### ‘Thargoid Roar’ Leaked to Public

Classified audio-visual footage from the Battle of HIP 22460 has been anonymously submitted to several mainstream newsfeeds.

The Alliance Tribune, The Federal Times, The Imperial Herald, The Sovereign and Vox Galactica all received databanks salvaged from various wreckages in the HIP 22460 system. Most were obtained from naval vessels, along with a handful recovered from independent ship’s logs.

Superpower-based newsfeeds elected not to publish any information related to their own militaries, citing security guidelines. But enough material has reached the public domain to portray the sequence of events of August 9th: the activation of the Proteus Wave, the Thargoid counter-attack, and the subsequent destruction of huge numbers of ships.

These files include audio recordings of a broadcast of unknown origin that occurred throughout HIP 22460. They match previously unverified descriptions of a so-called ‘Thargoid roar’, something that has been discussed by independent journalist Flint Lafosse and Vox Galactica reporter Jade Sanderlyn.

Several interpretations of this unearthly sound have been offered. Professor Shamus Madigan believed it to be “residual electromagnetic radiation from the Thargoids’ energy pulse on HIP 22460 10b”. Dr Jeong-Hui Shin theorised that it was “a burst of frenzied communication to – or from – some distant location”. Meanwhile, the First Apostle of the True Chapters claimed: “The voice of the Far God calls to the faithful. The manifestation has begun.”

Coupled with the Thargoid expansion from HIP 22460 and their recent invasion of three inhabited systems, this new revelation has fuelled public anxiety over the Thargoid threat. Members of the Alliance Assembly, Federal Congress and Imperial Senate have reassured their citizens that there is no need for panic. It is believed that several intelligence agencies have opened investigations into the source of the leak, the content of which is believed to have been classified by military departments.

Anti-Thargoid operations are continuing in the 42 n Persei, Chun Pindit and Tekkeitjal systems. The Federation has submitted several Farragut-class battle cruisers to help repel Thargoid forces. Local factions organising the defensive efforts have called for independent pilots to join the fight.

## 16 SEP

### The Judgement of Admiral Tanner

A special tribunal of the Federal Navy Criminal Court has deliberated the case of former admiral Aden Tanner and made a final decision.

The following press release was released to all Federal newsfeeds:

“This tribunal has scrutinised the latest evidence supplied by the Federal Attorney’s Office. We find that the analysis of Salvation’s superweapons does indeed substantiate Mr Tanner’s allegation that they were designed to provoke a hostile response from the Thargoids. Azimuth Biotech has been unable to verify that its claimed ‘anti-xeno detection network’ exists, explaining that most of Salvation’s advanced designs were not widely shared within the corporation.”

“Nevertheless, regardless of motive or moral justification, Mr Tanner directly disobeyed orders when the Musashi staged an assault on Hind Mine in the T Tauri system. It is therefore our judgement that the court martial verdict on the 12th of January stands. The request for a retrial has been denied. Having been convicted of mutiny and unlawful military action, he remains dishonourably discharged and has been stripped of his rank and honours.”

“We do acknowledge the ethical argument that the Proteus Wave would not have been constructed, and many lives may have been saved, if the Musashi had gained access to Hind Mine starport. In light of this context to the case, Mr Tanner’s sentence has been commuted to time served, and he is free to leave Federal custody. However, he is permanently barred from entering civil or military service.”

## 20 SEP

### Far God Cult Under Federal Scrutiny

The Order of the Far God is facing an official investigation and increased public maltreatment within the Federation.

Freelance journalist Alexei Keel published a special report via Vox Galactica:

“The Thargoid-worshipping cult has always been a controversial faith on Federal worlds. But it is currently causing a civil backlash of the sort not seen since 3304.”

“A recent exposé by the Federal Free Press proves that naval intelligence operatives are investigating all chapters of the cult established in Federal space. Allegedly, there are suspicions that cultists may be undertaking acts of espionage to sabotage anti-xeno operations.”

“As more details of the Battle of HIP 22460 become public knowledge, the pacifistic cultists have become an easy target for ordinary people seeking some kind of revenge against overtly pro-Thargoid ideologies. Although security forces claim to be responding to these vigilante attacks, widespread prejudice means that local police rarely act when such crimes are reported.”

Antipathy to the religion has increased to the point where prominent figures in the Federal government are calling for it be outlawed. As Secretary of State Lana Berkovich put it: “Humanity is at war with the Thargoids. To allow an army of crazed alien sympathisers within our society is to invite disaster.”

All of this has driven thousands of worshippers to abandon their hive-chapels and join the more radical True Chapters sect. Welcoming the new converts, the First Apostle proclaimed: “We must defend our faith and ourselves, so we may witness the Far God’s manifestation with our own eyes.”

The exotheologian Dr Alfred Ulyanov has remarked on this as “a fundamental shift from the fatalism of their conventional beliefs”. Keel raises the question in his report: what happens if Far God cultists stop tolerating these hostile acts and start fighting for survival?

### Aisling Criticises Imperial Policy

Princess Aisling Duval has challenged the Empire’s shift in priority towards reduced interaction with other superpowers.

During an interview with the Citizens’ Chronicle newsfeed, she remarked:

“It’s obvious that the Imperial Navy is deeply embarrassed by its commitment to Salvation, and is as good as paralyzed without his superweapon technology. The Emperor is now attempting to save face by severing all collaborative projects with the Alliance and Federation. Frankly, I think this is short-sighted and self-defeating.”

“Our naval crews in HIP 22460 died as heroes, of course, but we should not ignore that they were acting in coalition with Allied and Federal taskforces. This tragedy affected all of us, and we do not honour the dead by pretending otherwise. All of us with the ability to help, no matter our allegiance, must do more to support the families of everyone lost in that appalling catastrophe, while recognising the likelihood of further casualties of war.”

Hadrian Augustus Duval publicly disagreed with his cousin’s viewpoint, as quoted by Paresa News Network:

“Despite my respect for Princess Aisling, I must admit that Emperor Arissa has my support in this matter – something I never believed I would ever say. My position has always been that our Empire is weakened by relying on external forces of any kind. So it’s gratifying to see the wisdom of this policy finally being acknowledged.”

## 21 SEP

### Demands for Azimuth to Face Justice

There are widespread calls to bring criminal charges against Azimuth Biotech for its role in the massacre in the HIP 22460 system.

Rhiannon Grady, director of the civil rights organisation Advocacy, told the media:

“Azimuth Biotech planned the operation in HIP 22460, with the Proteus Wave’s failure leading directly to the slaughter of well over a hundred thousand naval personnel and combat pilots by Thargoids. Salvation’s death does not absolve his corporation of its culpability. We believe that charges of wilful endangerment and accessory to mass murder should be made, and those responsible be should be brought before a court of law.”

Other citizens’ groups have made similar claims, with some calling for the superpowers’ leaders to resign or stand trial for supporting Salvation. These demands were given legal weight by a recent ruling from the Federal Navy Criminal Court in the case of Aden Tanner, which acknowledged that preventing the construction of the Proteus Wave may have saved many lives.

Torben Rademaker, acting CEO of Azimuth Biotech, gave this statement in response:

“Media outlets and uninformed laymen often refer to the ‘failure’ of the Proteus Wave. The truth is that it worked precisely as intended, by shutting down all Thargoid vessels in HIP 22460. Unfortunately, Dr Wycherley did not anticipate that the aliens had developed a technology to recalibrate his superweapon to affect human ships.”

“I must make this clear: one man’s regrettable miscalculation does not reflect on Azimuth Biotech as a whole. Our organisation has pioneered xenological research for decades, and we have many dedicated experts in different fields. We must accept that weapons development comes with risks. But there is no such thing as failure in scientific endeavour.”

## 22 SEP

### Aisling Requests Rare Items to Fund Charity

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

A fundraiser hosted by Princess Aisling aims to finance a support network for Imperial citizens affected by Thargoid aggression.

The Citizens’ Relief Trust has been established in the Cemiess system, prompted by the loss of thousands of military personnel during the Battle of HIP 22460. She announced:

“While the Empire is focused on increasing its military strength, we must not forget the human cost of ongoing conflict with the Thargoids. Those who died in battle will be honoured by assisting the families and dependants left to mourn them. The Citizens’ Relief Trust plans to establish support centres to ensure their financial and emotional needs are met.”

“To raise funding, I have requested deliveries of Eshu Umbrellas, Xihe Biomorphic Companions and Chateau De Aegaeon. These luxury commodities will be auctioned or sold at a special gala I plan to host for Imperial nobility, with all proceeds used to establish this network. Wine and fish is also requested to serve to our distinguished guests.”

“Although we cannot help those bereaved families who live beyond the Empire’s borders, I hope that the Citizens’ Relief Trust inspires the creation of similar charities elsewhere.”

Pilots are asked to make their deliveries to Mackenzie Relay starport in the Cemiess system, with planned rewards including luxury vessel paint jobs. At special request from Princess Aisling, Lavigny’s Legion has been tasked with accepting shipments and protecting those who are transporting these valuable cargos. Combat bonds will be reimbursed for all wanted ships that are destroyed in the system.

## 23 SEP

### Alliance-Sirius Pact Prepares New Taskforce

The anti-xeno strategic defence pact between the Alliance and Sirius Corporation has been fully ratified as a legally binding treaty.

The Assembly voted to approve the agreement at the end of June, following months of debate. The decision was influenced by the outcome of two competing initiatives to procure resource packages for the Alliance Defence Force (ADF).

Admiral Nikolas Glass, the Sirius Navy representative on the Council of Admirals, delivered this statement:

“Now that the legalities have been addressed, a demonstration of the defence pact’s potential is long overdue. I am very pleased to announce that a new anti-xeno taskforce is being assembled under the name Operation Tyndareus, in honour of the megaship lost in HIP 22460.”

“A tactical combination of ADF ships and Sirius Corporation’s resources will deliver a devastating counterstrike at the next opportunity. This will demonstrate that our unified forces can repel Thargoid attackers and defend Allied space.”

Shortly before this announcement, an editorial in the Old Worlds Gazette remarked: “So far, Sirius has not fired a single shot in this war. Do they plan to save us by offering the Thargoids special discounts?” Other critics agreed that the defence pact looked increasingly like an administrative exercise rather than a military strategy.

Councillor Hildegard Dressler, who represents the Leesti system, told The Alliance Tribune:

“I know that the prime minister shares the public’s frustration with the slow process of bureaucratic approval. He has called upon Sirius Corporation to fast-track its plans urgently, and Operation Tyndareus will be the result.”

### Deep Space ‘Anomalies’ Generate Discussion

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Inexplicable visual phenomena located in deep space have caused extensive speculation and media interest.

There is no official terminology for the signals but they are referred to by many names, most popular of which is ‘the anomalies’. Appearing as a bright flare with spiralling radial arms, they emit electromagnetic feedback that can be detected using full spectrum system (FSS) scanners.

The first anomaly was discovered beyond the permit-locked Col 70 sector, with additional signals now observed. Multiple calculations have verified that the objects are moving, supposedly at faster-than-light speeds. Various estimates as to their trajectory have been made, but the great distances involved defy accurate measurement.

The appearance of the anomalies so soon after the Battle of HIP 22460 has led many to assume that they are somehow related to the Thargoids. These fears have been exacerbated by the claims of the Far God cult that this is a sign of their deity’s imminent arrival, but early analysis has yielded no evidence that the anomaly is Thargoid in origin.

The engineer Kit Fowler collated several ideas during his End Times broadcast:

“The anomaly could be some form of hyperspace distortion generated by an exceptionally large object heading our way. Or maybe the Thargoids have built a dimensional portal, through which their fleets can attack anywhere. Perhaps they’ve fired a colossal system-destroying weapon at Sol, as an act of revenge against humanity for the Proteus Wave. We’ve got to prepare for the very worst, people!”

However, Professor Elizabeth Perez of Orion University quickly dismissed these theories:

“Such outlandish notions illustrate how people draw imaginary patterns between unconnected events. Scientific progress has not stopped us inventing human-centric explanations for natural phenomena, especially when experiencing feelings of guilt or paranoia.”

## 26 SEP

### Federal Crackdown on Thargoid Worshippers

The Federal government has declared the Order of the Far God to be a potential enemy of the state.

The following press statement was delivered from the White House on Mars:

“The Federal Navy Intelligence Office has uncovered sufficient cause for concern to suspect the Far God cult of treason. They are believed to be responsible for leaking classified audiovisual data from the HIP 22460 system, while sharing other sensitive Thargoid-related material internally. Due to this, the risk that they will frustrate anti-xeno operations is deemed considerable.”

“President Hudson has therefore ordered military units to take control of all hive-chapels in Federal systems. Their inhabitants will be placed in detention facilities and subject to questioning.”

In related news, Secretary of State Lana Berkovich has sponsored a resolution petitioning Congress to make the Order of the Far God illegal. She has cited constitutional amendments that prevent citizens from providing aid and comfort to an enemy of the state.

The civil rights organisation Advocacy, the Galactic Interfaith Commune and the Spiritual Freedom Movement have all condemned these actions. However, political opinion polls suggest that a majority of voters are in favour of banning the Far God cult in the Federation.

Shadow President Felicia Winters issued the following response:

“I understand there are concerns regarding a Thargoid-based religious order, especially at this time. But there must be concrete evidence supporting these allegations before we treat our own citizens as enemies. It seems to me that Hudson’s administration is desperate to appear ‘tough on Thargoids’ after the debacle in HIP 22460, and has found an easy scapegoat to generate popular support.”

### Tesreau Announces Bid to Reform Aegis

A media forum is being arranged that will officially propose reinstating the tri-superpower anti-xeno agency.

The event is being organised by Professor Alba Tesreau, former head of research for Aegis. She delivered a statement to all newsfeeds:

“As the war against the Thargoids intensifies, the need for centralised xenological research is more vital than ever. This press conference will put forward a case to convince leaders in the Alliance, Empire and Federation to review their decision to dismantle Aegis.”

“The Baumann Report highlighted many of Aegis’s limitations, and we do not intend to ignore these. Improvements to several departments would have to be made. But the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism Unit proved that cross-superpower collaboration can be efficient, flexible and effective. Aegis could be restructured along similar lines to prevent repeating its past mistakes.”

Invitations to the conference have been sent to key political figures. Allied Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran has agreed to attend. Federal Ambassador Jasmina Halsey has offered her support, but no members of Congress have responded publicly. The Imperial Senate acknowledged Professor Tesreau, but formally stated that the Empire has no interest in further cooperation with the other superpowers at this time.

The three-day forum is scheduled to begin on Monday 3rd October in New Apollo City on the planet Biggs Colony.

### Thargoids Retreat from Three Systems

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The conflicts in the 42 n Persei, Chun Pindit and Tekkeitjal systems have ended with the withdrawal of Thargoid vessels.

All three systems reported the simultaneous arrival of Thargoid forces on the 12th of September, following an expansion of their presence from HIP 22460. Unlike many previous incursions, however, no starports came under direct attack.

Large numbers of independent pilots volunteered to defend the systems’ populations. Commanders BL1P, EmulatedPenguin and Klemyr, in particular, distinguished themselves in battle against the Thargoids, setting an example among many skilled pilots and AX squadrons that took part.

The Federal Navy also sent several Farragut-class battle cruisers, each outfitted with specialist AX weaponry, to directly engage the Thargoids. These have now been redeployed, with Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori claiming: “The overwhelming firepower of the Federation’s capital ships proved more than a match for our alien foe.”

However, other sources claimed that the Thargoid fleets were not completely spent and instead made a tactical withdrawal. Several witnesses, interviewed by Vox Galactica field reporters, claim to have observed large numbers of undamaged Thargoid vessels departing into hyperspace.

The formally organised defence operations have already concluded, but contributing pilots can still collect their rewards from Bennington's Rest in the 42 n Persei system, Samuda Terminal in the Chun Pindit system, and Riemann Colony in the Tekkeitjal system.

### Federal Forces Target the True Chapters

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Conflict has erupted in Popontia as the Federation seeks to apprehend True Chapters cultists of the Far God cult.

The Workers of Popontia Free, which is sympathetic to the sect’s right to practise its religion, was outfitting the Dedicant megaship for the chapter’s use. Federal ships have been deployed in the Popontia system with the intention of detaining all cultists and seizing the megaship.

Governor Nadia Machado, representing Popontia Incorporated, declared:

“By order of President Hudson, all Thargoid worshippers are under suspicion of espionage and abetting our alien enemies. The True Chapters group is ordered to surrender for lawful questioning.”

Popontia Incorporated has been tasked with overseeing this mission. Payment has been authorised for Federal auxiliaries and independent pilots willing to pledge their support in subduing True Chapters supporters.

From the Testament megaship, the First Apostle of the True Chapters delivered a broadcast across public channels:

“The Dedicant will be a new home for us to await the Far God’s arrival. We are prepared to die to defend this holy calling. Our recognised patrons in the Workers of Popontia Free will fight to protect us and reward those who aid our cause.”

These unprecedented hostilities were commented on by Dr Alfred Ulyanov, an academic authority on the Order of the Far God:

“This is the first time that members of this faith have not calmly accepted their own fate. According to my research, the First Apostle preaches that the Far God will transform her followers upon Its manifestation, allowing them to survive while the rest of humanity is extinguished. This has evidently motivated True Chapters adherents to abandon their wholly passive stance.”

Both campaigns are being orchestrated by contacts in the system’s primary starport, Ryman Market.

### Delivery Campaign Helps Fund Imperial Charity

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

An initiative in the Cemiess system has procured sufficient rare items to ensure a successful Citizens’ Relief Trust gala.

The new charitable organisation will establish support centres for the relatives of Imperial citizens who have died as a result of Thargoid aggression. The trust’s patron, Princess Aisling Duval, made a declaration via public media:

“The quantity of Eshu Umbrellas, Xihe Biomorphic Companions and Chateau De Aegaeon that we received have gladdened my heart. I am already preparing invitations for a splendid charity gala at my palace on Emerald, where these luxuries will be auctioned to raise capital for the Citizens’ Relief Trust.”

“I offer my personal thanks to everyone who took part in this campaign. Your efforts will directly honour those who paid the ultimate price in this horrific conflict with the Thargoids.”

Shipments of wine and fish were also provided, and will be served to the expected attendees and related entourages.

A public statement was also made by Senator Denton Patreus:

“It is Imperial Navy protocol to provide financial support to the families of all officers, crew and support staff whose lives are lost in the performance of their duties. Nevertheless, we all appreciate Her Highness’s public spirit, and I’m pleased to see just how much the noble houses are prepared to sacrifice to assist the citizenry.”

Contributing pilots can now collect payment for their deliveries at Mackenzie Relay in the Cemiess system. Luxury vessel paint jobs will be made available to qualifying pilots soon. Lavigny’s Legion has confirmed that it will also reimburse combat bonds.

### FSS Upgrade to Track Anomalous Signals

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Full spectrum system (FSS) scanners are being updated with the aim of discovering the nature of the interstellar anomalies.

Cynthia Sideris, chairperson of Universal Cartographics, gave this statement to the press:

“The scientific community remains fascinated by the phenomena that we have classified as ‘rogue signal sources’. At present we can calculate their approximate direction and velocity, but otherwise they remain a mystery. We have therefore worked with several corporations to enhance the ability of ships to analyse the signals.”

“Engineers from Auger Vision, Jick Nackson Enterprises, Long Embedded Systems, LURP Ship Systems and other specialist companies collaborated to improve the long-range detection capabilities of FSS scanners. Their collaborative efforts produced a firmware upgrade that is designed to isolate these unique electromagnetic emissions.”

“By agreement with every ship manufacturer, Universal Cartographics has rolled out this free update to all FSS scanners. Our hope is that with more pilots targeting the rogue signal sources, we can triangulate their positions more accurately and, perhaps, determine their composition.”

The objects continue to travel at faster-than-light speeds between distant systems, defying all attempts to intercept them. Their appearance does not match any naturally occurring stellar bodies known to science.

### Militaries Prepare for Further Thargoid Strikes

The prospect of more systems being invaded by Thargoids has placed the Alliance, Empire and Federation on high alert.

Ernesto Rios, field correspondent for Vox Galactica, summarised the situation:

“Following the Battle of HIP 22460, there was anticipation that the Thargoids would expand into neighbouring regions. Swarms of hostile vessels did indeed arrive in the 42 n Persei, Chun Pindit and Tekkeitjal systems, although – in a notable change to their former tactics – no starports suffered a direct attack.”

“The Federal Navy quickly responded by deploying Farragut-class battle cruisers. President Zachary Hudson proclaimed that these successfully drove out the invaders, but many observers suspect that the Thargoids’ withdrawal when the fighting remained fierce was intentional.”

“In the Empire, Senator Denton Patreus considered these events ‘an indication that the Thargoids are probing humanity’s defensive capabilities’. But details of the Imperial Navy’s anti-xeno strategy remained confidential, a sign of the Empire shift away from military coordination with other superpowers.”

“The Alliance has claimed to be in a position of readiness. Admiral Nikolas Glass reported: ‘Operation Tyndareus, backed by Sirius Corporation, is now active. The Alliance Defence Force is ready to deploy anti-xeno taskforces, should the Thargoids dare to launch an assault within Allied space.’ Meanwhile, critics of the strategic defence pact have observed that only two megaships currently possess AX weaponry, casting doubt over the ADF’s effectiveness.”

“Elsewhere, many independent systems are doing whatever they can to bolster their local security forces. Too many worlds are acutely aware that should Thargoid fleets darken their skies, they would be forced to rely on mercenaries and independent pilots for protection.”

“Popular opinion on continued military actions against Thargoid vessels remains primarily favourable, but the ‘xeno-peace’ discussion continues to grow. In the Aiabiko system, leading ICE personality Joy Senne has released a ‘beacon drop’ package in an effort to promote the idea of peace to independent pilots. Ships scanning the beacon will receive a xeno-affirmative ship nameplate set and decal - paid for by Senne - along with clips of a recent discussion with Sovereign Times anchor Heimar Borichev about the so-called ‘Thargoid Advocacy Project’.”
