## Basics of exobiology

### Prerequisites

**Exobiologist** is an integral part of exploration. The Full Spectrum System Scanner (FSSS) and the Detailed Surface Scanner (DSS) are essential. All ships are equipped by default with a FSSS. The DSS is optional, but required to detect exobiology on the surface of an astronomical body (planet or moon). Many exobiological organisms exist in rough and hilly terrain. Thus it is more convenient to conduct exobiology in a small and fast ship which can easily land in small landing spots. For example the Imperial Courier, Dolphin and Diamondback Explorer can park anywhere due to their small footprint. The Imperial Courier can go 800m/s with large shields. The Asp Explorer has a nice cockpit view for skimming the surface. Use a FSD SCO to quickly travel to and from the surface. Fast ships make it easier to skim the surface for bios. They can cross the planet and if you can't find a sample then leave the planet and go to the next one. A shield generator protects the ship's hull if you misjudge your landing speed and hit the ground.   

Every small ship has limited internals and tradeoffs. The Dolphin has the most internals, but it is weak for any combat. The Dolphin can be equipped with a big scoop and a class 4 FSD booster for a decent jump range. It can also be equipped with an SRV bay and A class 4 shield. The Adder is only useful for short ranges, but it needs carrier support. The Viper Mk IV is better for long-range without a carrier. 

If you have a Drake-Class Carrier then you don't need to worry about fuel scooping, jump range nor an Auto Field-Maintenance Unit to repair damaged modules.

The Artemis Suit is essential, because only this suit has a Genetic Sampler. It can be purchased at stations or outposts in the Pioneer supplies store. Occasionally, in such stores you can find level 2 or 3 suits. Sometimes they are pre-installed with engineer modifications, but not all modifications are equally useful. The basic keyboard mapping for the sampler/scanner is 5.

### Search for specific places

It is best to search for exobiology species away from inhabited star systems or on astronomical bodies suitable for atmospheric landing that have not yet had First Footfall (displayed on the system map when hovering over an astronomical object). The reward for primary finds in such places will be 4x higher. 

If you plot around to discover a sector, in the galaxy map go to User Data mode and disable the filter to show only unvisited stars.

Biologicals group in a certain area - if a star sector has a group of biologicals, the chances are high that other stars in the neighbourhood will have the same types and groups. Bookmark systems with good exobiology planets and look around the bookmarked areas.

### How to

In the system view, check planets with an atmosphere (it shows a blue atmosphere around the planet icon) and that it's landable (quarter arc icon around the top left of a planet). The 3rd tab on the right of Planetary Information under Features at the bottom will list if there are biologicals.

Fly towards the sunny side of the planet to map that so that it's easier to land there later. If the planet is over ~4000 Ls away from a star, don't bother, because the star light will be very faint which makes it difficult to find stuff on the surface.

Map the planet with the surface scanner. Shoot the probes at the white targets on the 4 corners and one at the back to map the whole planet. If there are multiple biologicals select 1 with the least surface area. Chances are high that the signals will overlap so that you'll find all the signal sources around the same place.

Look for the greenish grey colour - blue and light indicate there are biologicals in the area, while greenish blue indicates the location. The heat map may show a green gray colour with the selected biological.

As you approach the planet, switch between combat mode and go to the terrain type where it's most likely to find the biological.

Disembark from your ship, walk to the biological and sample it with the Genetic Sampler (by default press 5). You must take 3 samples of the same biological. Each biological type has a different distance between them to sample again. If the samples are too close you'll get an insufficient diversity error. The lights on the Genetic Sampler canister increase with each collected sample.

You can fly around for more biologicals. You can slow down quickly with the landing gear and cargo scoop deployed.

### Selection

To collect genomes you need to find worlds with tenuous atmospheres or a non-atmospheric world with the Full Spectrum System Scanner. When detected on a planetary body or after a complete system scan on the System Map choose a specific planetary body. The number of outstanding signals « Biological » will be indicated in parentheses for this body including the life forms. For a particular genus, only 1 type can be available such as 1 type of bacterium or stratum. After discovering a body with biological types of signals, fly to it and map the surface. If you don't do this then even if this place is full of exotic species, you will not be able to detect a single species. After mapping, when the Analysis mode is enabled, the planetary body will reveal areas with probable habitats of these life forms from blue to greenish. The greenish color indicates the highest density of biological life forms. The gamma and color saturation may vary slightly due to the graphics settings and features of your monitor.

Switch from Analysis Mode to Combat Mode and back, choose the place with the right topography to land within the most suitable color spot. The inclined mountain or hilly surface may be indicated in a more favorable color due to the larger surface area that is visible from the ship. If the species is found not only in mountainous or hilly terrain, it is preferable to land in a flat area.

### Search for types to collect

This can be the most tiring stage, since some species are only determined from a height (e.g. Bacterium). Some that grow in the highlands are detected using a set of external cameras (e.g. Fungoida). You could use an SRV if the distance takes long such as 1 hour. However, usually the exobiology species grow in open areas.

If a cluster of species is detected, you can land and use the SRV and then go On Foot to collect 3 parts of a copy of each genus (*if the genus is not one*) with the Genetic Sampler. Each part, depending on the type of exobiology, is located at a certain distance up to 1 km.

| Species | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Bacterium | on the flat areas outside of craters - not illuminated by night vision, dark puddles ~200m, become their natural colour ~100. |
| Cactoida | rocky hills, small round pebbly things |
| Concha | hilly / rocky, pretty small. |
| Electricae | on plains |
| Fonticulua | Flat bits outside craters / rocky terrain - giant mushroom |
| Frutexa | plains / rockside in mountains / hilly area - fly low - bushes |
| Fumerola | on rocks on flat areas |
| Fungoida | on high mountain sides, very small, night vision helps little dots ~200m, more define ~100m |
| Osseus | on rocky areas of large flat plains. They look like big standing round flat mushrooms. Easy to confuse with rocks, but are much rounder. Night vision helps ~300m |
| Tubus | on plains - sometimes on rocky terrain |
| Tussock | on plains / flat areas in mountains - small grasses, fly low |

Wait for the sample to register on the screen by the game (Observatory Botanist registers faster) before boarding your ship and searching for the next sample. When you have 3 samples, wait for the Sampler canister replacement animation to finish before sampling again.

### Payouts

Higher payouts are given when you make 1-3 firsts: first discovered, first scanned and First Footfall. Planetary bodies are usually already discovered in the Core Systems. If there are undiscovered biologicals then you will get a first discovery bonus of 4x the hand in prize. When you hand in, you will first receive the normal prize and then on the first discovered page you will get extra big payouts.

The "first logged" bonus: if your sample is the first of a species from a terrestrial body then a bonus is granted. If a system contains similar species across multiple bodies then it may be worth sequencing all of them.

## Development

The Exobiologist career path and ranks were added with the ED: Odyssey expansion in May 2021. Thus exobiology on planets with tenuous atmospheres requires Odyssey.
