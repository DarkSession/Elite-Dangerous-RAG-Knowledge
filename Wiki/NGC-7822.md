NGC 7822
 		 	 

The **NGC 7822** nebula has a collection of stars arranged in a rough cylinder facing Sol. The red glow of the nebula meets the blue glow of a class O star. NGC 7822 is well above the galactic ecliptic. It is about 2,790 light years from Sol.

Life Sciences Expedition has an asteroid base in NGC 7822 Sector BQ-Y d12 on the edge of the nebula.

[as of the update in April 2020, a line of stars, majority of them with one or more blackholes, sits in the center of the nebula, and the line itself points towards sol, meaning this is a simple data mistake, and isn't a real anomaly.]
