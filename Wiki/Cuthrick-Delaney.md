Steward of Prism
Imperial Ambassador

**Cuthrick Delaney** is a member of the Imperial Diplomatic Corps. Delaney was involved in the events surrounding the assassination of Dr. Hans Walden, the dictator of Lave, in 3265. Later, he served as the Imperial ambassador to the Prism system, and became the steward of Prism in July 3301 when its original administrator, Imperial Senator Kahina Tijani Loren, disappeared. He retained the system's stewardship after Loren was stripped of her rank and title after being convicted in October 3302 of dereliction of duty and attempting to assassinate Senator and Admiral of the Fleet Denton Patreus. Delaney remained a staunch supporter of Loren and maintained that she was innocent of her crimes.

16 MAR 3303

- Ambassador Cuthrick Delaney, steward of the Prism system, has announced that the Loren's Legion appeal for Tantalum has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Hundreds of independent pilots responded to the appeal, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Hiram's Anchorage, the organisation's base of operations. In a statement, Delaney said: "Loren's Legion would like to extend its gratitude to all the Commanders who rallied to our call. Our immediate economic issues have been addressed, thanks to your efforts." Pilots who contributed to the initiative are now free to collect their rewards from Hiram's Anchorage in the Prism system.^[1]^

28 OCT 3302

- Today, an announcement was made outside the Prism Hall of Justice confirming that Kahina Tijani Loren had been found guilty of the attempted assassination of Admiral Denton Patreus. The announcement was met with cries of dismay from a crowd of Loren's supporters, who had turned out to hear the verdict. "Ms Loren has been sentenced to life imprisonment at Koontz Asylum in the Daibo system," said a court clerk. A leaked recording from the press room showed Loren talking with two unidentified men. Their conversation ran as follows: "And what do you want in return for your...favour?" one man asked. "Patreus's head on a platter," responded Loren.
Having already been stripped of the title of 'senator', Loren's status as a Lady of the Empire was similarly revoked. She was taken to a secure holding facility after the verdict was announced. Princess Aisling Duval spoke to The Imperial Citizen about the trial: "The woman is clearly deranged. She tried to kill Patreus, but justice has been served. The galaxy is now a safer place." Admiral Denton Patreus, emerging from the courtroom, smiled and said: "They that sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind." Ambassador Cuthrick Delaney, administrator of the Prism system, spoke briefly to The Imperial Herald. "We cannot deny the verdict, but we are dismayed by the outcome. We remain convinced that Kahina Loren is innocent. We will leave no stone unturned in our search for the truth." Meanwhile, an anonymous source affiliated with the Imperial justice system said: "It's a de facto death sentence. No one returns from Koontz Asylum."^[2]^

26 OCT 3302

- The trial of Lady Kahina Tijani Loren has begun at the Prism Hall of Justice. Earlier this week, several flotillas of heavily armed ships arrived in the Prism system. The vessels docked at the Hiram's Anchorage starport amid tight security enforced by Imperial forces and local organisation Loren's Legion, which controls the Prism system. Much of Hiram's Anchorage has been off limits to civilians during the week because of fears that Loren's presence, and that of Admiral Denton Patreus, would lead to renewed instability. Loren's return to her home system is controversial in itself, as she has not been there since she ceded executive power to Ambassador Cuthrick Delaney. Loren was briefly seen in conversation with Ambassador Delaney, who embraced Loren before she was moved to a secure holding area. Admiral Patreus arrived a few hours later. Media representatives have not been allowed to speak to either Loren or Patreus, and it is understood that the trial will be conducted behind closed doors. The mood in Prism is sombre. Support for Loren is muted, with few willing to publically support her ahead of the trial. But it is clear there is little enthusiasm for Admiral Patreus, either.^[3]^

14 OCT 3302

- Kahina Tijani Loren has been stripped of the rank of senator for delegating her responsibilities in respect of the Prism system to Ambassador Cuthrick Delaney in 3301. An aide for Admiral Denton Patreus said: "Loren gave up her senatorial responsibilities, so it's unreasonable that she continue to be protected by the title. Frankly, she shouldn't be described as a 'lady', either, but we will let the courts make that determination." This means Loren will now be tried based on the laws of her nominated home system, which is of course the Prism system. Loren has been moved from Achenar and is presumed to be en route to Prism, under guard. While Prism remains under the supervision of Ambassador Cuthrick Delaney, it is heavily exploited by Admiral Patreus. Patreus's aide said: "Those without a proper appreciation of due process might believe there is a conflict of interest, given Admiral Patreus's influence in Prism, but we can ensure the galactic community that Imperial law will be followed to the letter."^[4]^

21 JUL 3301

- In the early hours of this morning, a security alert was received from the Imperial suite where Senator Kahina Tijani Loren has been residing. The entry to the residence was found to be locked, and no response was received from inside. Security personnel were authorised to break in. The interior of the suite was found to be pristine, with no evidence of habitation. In-room holofac consoles were found not to have been used throughout the duration of the Senator's apparent occupation. A search has revealed no sign of the Senator's whereabouts. Ambassador Cuthrick Delaney made a brief statement to the press. "Senator Kahina has previously empowered me to represent the Prism system on her behalf. I will do my best to discharge that duty according to her instructions. Senator Kahina is a very private individual, and has not sought my, or any other, counsel in the last month. We do not know where she has gone. Naturally we are concerned about her safety and would urge anyone who knows of her whereabouts to contact the authorities immediately. Her disappearance is very disturbing indeed." Reaction across the Empire was muted, but many have speculated that something underhand has happened to the visiting Senator. "Doesn't matter what Delaney says," said a commentator from the Imperial Citizen. "Prism belongs to Patreus now, Kahina's just abandoned it and all the citizens she professed to care about. She's a coward and an irrelevance. Did she get too close to the fires burning in the Empire?" asked Kazien Vantris, chief editor of the Imperial Herald. "Or is she pursuing some other objective? She was always determined and bold. Wherever you've gone, Lady Kahina, farewell." Lady Kahina's Imperial Courier, the ‘Seven Veils’, still at the Capitol spaceport, was impounded and examined. It was found to be completely stripped of all valuable equipment, with the modifications made at Avalon shipyards discovered to be carefully crafted fakes. Lady Kahina's Imperial tiara was found in the cockpit, along with a small medallion bearing an ancient symbol on one side and the word 'Salomé' on the other. The symbol is believed to belong to an organisation some refer to as 'The Dark Wheel'.^[5]^

17 MAY 3301

- Senator Kahina Tijani Loren, currently residing as a guest on Capitol at the request of Chancellor Blaine, remains completely ambivalent to inquiries into her intentions. She has airily dismissed questions regarding her purpose or what was said to her at the reception to which she was summoned and continues to ignore requests from the press. Now there appears to be another name in the frame. Cuthrick Delaney, ambassador to the Prism system, has had a long and varied career within the Empire, first coming to prominence during the events which ended the dictatorship of Dr. Walden on the Old World planet of Lave. His precise involvement in that event was unclear, and he seems to have lost none of his ability to stay close to those with power in the intervening time. He has been seen in conversation with Kahina on many occasions. There is considerable conjecture as to what stance Kahina will take. Many have stated that her aggressive tendencies will align her to Senator Patreus. Others have pointed out her support for traditional Imperial slavery, and her distant family connection to the Duvals, indicates an allegiance with Senator Torval is more likely. It would appear that only Kahina, and perhaps Cuthrick Delaney, actually know. In other news, the Senator's ship was confirmed to have had some significant modifications made to it recently, including a state of the art fuel scoop and a custom built Gutamaya discovery scanner.^[6]^
