**Aldebaran** is an Independent system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. The system is about 65 ly away from Sol, and the main star is an orange giant star and the brightest member of the zodiac constellation of Taurus, with an average apparent magnitude of 0.87.^[1]^

The name *Aldebaran* is Arabic (al-dabarƒÅn) and means "the Follower", presumably because the star rises near and soon after the Pleiades star cluster.^[2]^
