The **Advanced Docking Computer** is an upgraded version of the Standard Docking Computer. While the Standard Docking Computer only automates the process of docking with a Station or Surface Port, the Advanced Docking Computer can be used for both docking and departures from a Landing Pad. The ADC is equipped by default in all newly-purchased small ships.^[1]^

## Usage

> 
> 
> The Advanced Docking Computer provides cutting edge guidance control to the ship's computer, offering a further launch option alongside the assisted docking function. To engage the docking function, the pilot must move into range of the destination before throttling down to zero. The launch function can be initiated from the landing pad options. Raising the throttle manually will disengage the module.

The Advanced Docking Computer functions similarly to the Standard Docking Computer. When within docking request range (7.5 km) of a port, requesting docking permission and throttling down to zero will turn control of the ship over to the module, which will then guide the ship to its assigned Landing Pad automatically. When launching from a Landing Pad, the normal "Launch" command will be replaced with "Auto Launch", and the module will guide the ship away from the Landing Pad and to a short distance beyond its Station or Surface Port, where it will relinquish control to the pilot. The pilot can interrupt auto-docking or auto-launching at any time during the process by increasing the throttle slightly or manually cutting power to the Advanced Docking Computer.

As with the SDC, the ADC is not error-proof. At facilities with high traffic, the module may cause inadvertent collisions with other nearby ships, the Access Corridor, or structures on the exterior or interior of the station itself during both docking and launching. This can result in fines or even the accidental destruction of the ship. It is suggested that the pilot remain present during auto-docking and auto-launching to take control of ship should the ADC steer it into a hazardous situation.
