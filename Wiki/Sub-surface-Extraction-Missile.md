The **Sub-surface Extraction Missile** is a hardpoint module used to rescue humans from Thargoid Titans. It is a modified Sub-surface Displacement Missile designed by the Sirius Corporation and manufactured by Aegis.^[1]^^[2]^ It launches specialized missiles that can dig into a Titan sub-surface storage chamber to release Thargoid Bio-Storage Capsules.^[3]^

## Usage

> 
> 
> These specialised devices are designed to be used alongside the pulse wave xeno scanner, which can now pinpoint human life signs beneath the hull of a Titan. If accurately targeted, an extraction missile should penetrate far enough into the outer hull to jettison the pod-like structures containing captives. Assuming the extraction is successful, these capsules can then be taken onboard via cargo scoop.

The Sub-Surface Extraction Missile is used in a similar manner to the Sub-surface Displacement Missile. A Pulse Wave Xeno Scanner is required to locate Titan Sub-Surface storage chambers. Once these are located, the ship must enter Analysis Mode to fire an extraction missile at the chamber. A HUD element displays the depth of the missile inside the Titan's hull, allowing the pilot to manually detonate it when it reaches the storage chamber, marked in blue. A successful extraction will release around 10 Thargoid bio-storage capsules, which can be picked up using collector limpets or directly using the cargo scoop.

## Purchase locations

The Sub-Surface Extraction Missile is available for purchase at most rescue megaships.

## Notes

- Beware of nearby Thargoid Hunters, as they may attempt to retake the bio-storage capsules using their own limpet-like collectors.
- Each sub-surface storage chamber allows **one** attempt to breach the storage chamber.
