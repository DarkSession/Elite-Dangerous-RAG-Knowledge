Governor of New Kuwembaa Labour

**Sonal Mishra** is the Governor of New Kuwembaa Labour, an independent minor faction based in the Kuwembaa system that was originally a member of the Federation. Inspired by the successful rebellion of Azaladshu Free in protest against the Proactive Detection Bureau and Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, Mishra withdrew his faction from the Federal Accord on July 30, 3307, taking the systems of Kuwembaa, HIP 46179, Velniat, Navas, and Antliae Sector EG-Y d80 with him.

Acting on orders from President Zachary Hudson, the Federal loyalist faction Li Chotep for Equality attacked New Kuwembaa Labour on August 5, 3307 to forcibly reverse its secession attempt. As in Azaladshu, this subjugation effort failed. New Kuwembaa Labour retained its independence, and its victory was sufficiently overwhelming to inspire another three Federal factions, Selkana Labour, the United HIP 108095 Values Party, and Mutumu Future, to follow Governor Mishra's example and secede with a further 27 systems.

## Timeline

23 AUG 3307

- Shadow President Felicia Winters has claimed that further systems declaring independence could severely damage the Federation. Her statement was in response to the conflict in the Kuwembaa system, which resulted in more Federal factions seceding from the superpower. Dozens of others are now openly considering breaking away and becoming independent. Addressing Congress, Shadow President Winters said: "We now face the possibility of large-scale rebellion, as more citizens reject intrusion into their private lives. Unless these authoritarian surveillance laws are repealed, we risk many more factions and allies losing their trust in any Federal government." Vice President Jerome Archer responded: "The Proactive Detection Bureau provides increased security and decreased crime levels for all Federal systems. I deeply regret that a few have rejected its benefits, but we must concentrate on the bigger picture." The Sovereign newsfeed described how the newly seceded systems are celebrating freedom from government scrutiny. It claims that up to fifty other factions have expressed interest in becoming independent. However, The Federal Times reported that more pragmatic leaders have voiced concerns that they are now more vulnerable. There are particular fears of retaliation by pro-Federation groups or attacks from opportunistic hostile forces.^[1]^

12 AUG 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
New Kuwembaa Labour has successfully seceded from the Federation and inspired other systems to declare independence. The conflict in the Kuwembaa system ended with Federal loyalists Li Chotep for Equality being defeated. As a result, all systems controlled by New Kuwembaa Labour will remain independent. This has inspired Selkana Labour, United HIP 108095 Values Party and Mutumu Future to also sever ties with the Federation, spreading the rebellion across a further 28 systems. The victory was announced by Governor Sonal Mishra, the leader of New Kuwembaa Labour: "We owe a huge debt to all pilots who helped us secure our freedom. It is regrettable that we were forced to secede, but this should be a warning to President Hudson that he is taking the Federation down a dangerous path." The rebelling systems have now shut down links with the Proactive Detection Bureau, which monitors all private and public communications. More Federal factions are now debating secession as the only way to guarantee their citizens' privacy rights. Pilots who fought for New Kuwembaa Labour can now claim their rewards from Gagnan Port station. Li Chotep for Equality will reimburse Federal auxiliaries at the Fortress Liberty megaship.^[2]^

05 AUG 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
In the Kuwembaa system, the Federation is fighting to prevent further factions from declaring independence. New Kuwembaa Labour has broken ties with the Federation in protest against the government's civil surveillance programme. Li Chotep for Equality, a local Federal faction, has been tasked to degrade the rebelling faction's military strength. President Zachary Hudson made a brief public announcement: "I call upon all Federal auxiliaries to aid in this conflict. The reputation of the Federation cannot be so easily tarnished by such criminal action." Governor Sonal Mishra, the leader of New Kuwembaa Labour, also requested assistance: "The Federal Accord is no longer fit for purpose. We require support to make a stand against this violation of our constitutional rights." Three other Federal factions are about to declare themselves as independent sovereign states: Selkana Labour, United HIP 108095 Values Party and Mutumu Future. These control a combined total of 28 systems. However, two recently seceded factions – the Coalition of Uteran and Gluscap Labour – are considering rejoining the Federation, depending on the result of the Kuwembaa conflict. Pro-independence pilots can support New Kuwembaa Labour by delivering combat bonds to Gagnan Port station. Federal auxiliaries can fight on behalf of Li Chotep for Equality by handing in combat bonds at the Fortress Liberty megaship.^[3]^

30 JUL 3307

- New Kuwembaa Labour, which controls five systems, has triggered a second wave of secession by severing ties with the Federation. Following the victory of the Azaladshu Free, a minority of Federal factions are breaking away from the superpower in protest against its civil surveillance laws. Governor Sonal Mishra of New Kuwembaa Labour made this statement: "The Federal government has granted itself draconian powers to spy on its own citizens. Regrettably, the only way to avoid this is to withdraw from the Federal Accord. I urge the president to respect our wishes and accept our sovereign status." In response, President Zachary Hudson ordered Governor Mishra to abide by constitutional law or face the consequences. He has also redirected the Fortress Liberty megaship to the Kuwembaa system. Political commentators believe that three other democratic Federal factions are ready to follow the example of New Kuwembaa Labour. If this occurs, up to 28 further systems could become independent as a result. There are also reports that influential leaders within the Coalition of Uteran and Gluscap Labour, which both recently seceded, have expressed regret about leaving the Federation. The congressmen who previously represented them believe that these factions could be swayed to return.^[4]^
