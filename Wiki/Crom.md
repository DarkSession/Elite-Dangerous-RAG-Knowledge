**Crom** is an independent system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. The system is permit-locked, and the permit can be obtained by becoming Allied with the Crom Silver Boys minor faction in any system where it has a presence. The Rare Commodity Crom Silver Fesh can be purchased at Chorel Survey when the Crom Silver Boys are in control of it.

The Crom Silver Boys faction was one of 14 permit-holding factions that entered into an agreement on November 24, 3307 to maintain so-called Gatekeeper megaships to preserve interstellar trade regardless of local political shifts. These Gatekeeper megaships would be permanently stationed in systems adjacent to their corresponding permit-locked systems to ensure that pilots could reliably obtain permits. The Silver Cove was deployed in 69 G. Carinae as the Crom Silver Boys' Gatekeeper megaship.^[1]^
