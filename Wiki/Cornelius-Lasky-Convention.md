# Cornelius-Lasky Convention
The **Cornelius-Lasky Convention** was ratified by Chancellor Anders Blaine of the Empire, President Zachary Hudson of the Federation, and Prime Minister Edmund Mahon of the Alliance at the Galactic Summit in Sirius on March 3, 3307. Named for its two leading proponents, Senator Ava Cornelius and Congressman Kristine Lasky, the Convention required the three superpowers to share any information they obtained about large-scale threats to civilian populations, including environmental, medical, and xenological crises.^[1]^ This resulted in the creation of new communication protocols between the chiefs of security of the superpowers to allow them to coordinate their response to emergencies, and these protocols were first activated following the Nine Martyrs attack that interrupted the Galactic Summit on March 11, leading to the formation of the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit to combat the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army.^[2]^^[3]^

The signing of the Cornelius-Lasky Convention established a foundation for the Sirius Treaty, which was also proposed at the Galactic Summit.^[4]^
