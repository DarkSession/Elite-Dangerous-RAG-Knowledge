The **Cobra Mk III** is a small ship produced by Faulcon DeLacy. A time-honoured and well-respected design, the Cobra Mk III debuted in 3100 under the banner of its original manufacturer, Cowell & MgRath of Lave. The company has since been acquired by Faulcon DeLacy, which produces the modern iteration of the Cobra Mk III. The ship is a popular choice among new pilots looking for a jack-of-all-trades at an affordable price, and even experienced and wealthy pilots are known to return to the Cobra Mk III later in their careers.

## Overview

The Cobra Mk III is an exceedingly popular ship for good reason: it is a small, low-cost multirole vessel capable of performing very well in any role, and essentially serves as a much cheaper Python, making it a good stepping stone for every kind of pilot.

In combat the Cobra Mk III is quite potent. It has impressive damage output and defences for its price tier and it is very powerful when outfitted and engineered correctly, making it good at both Bounty Hunting and Pirating. The downside of this ship is the combat ability relative to other ships. For bounty hunters who are attempting to tackle skilled opponents the Cobra Mk III can be outmanoeuvred by Eagle Mk IIs and Viper Mk IIIs, however, its large cargo bay makes it more viable for pirates.

The Cobra's carrying capacity, being more than double that of the Hauler and Adder, and its cost, being almost one third that of the Type-6 Transporter, makes it a logical stepping stone for aspiring traders as there is no other ship capable of hauling more cargo at the Cobra's size and cost. If the Cobra Mk IV is not an option then it can remain viable due to its small landing pad requirement. In addition it has much better combat potential than freighters and can defend itself or run away from hostile interdictions.

The Cobra Mk III is also a good and affordable exploration ship due to the sizeable 16t Fuel Tank and the amount of Internal Compartments which allows for the placement of the necessary exploration modules such as a Detailed Surface Scanner, a Fuel Scoop and an Auto Field-Maintenance Unit without the need to remove the shield. The downside is its rather low jump range compared to other ships, which averages at 29 LY and can be surpassed by the much cheaper Adder and Hauler.

As a miner, the Mk III is very effective. The Mk III's additional hardpoints, compartments, and cargo space compared to the Adder make it very effective at its job, and it can even bring along Limpets due to the extra space. It is an excellent early choice for miners until they can afford a Keelback.

Cobra Mk III hardpoints convergence
 		 	 

The weapon hardpoints are located as follows: two Class 2 hardpoints in front of the cockpit on the upper surface ship, and two Class 1 hardpoints on the underside of the ship. The distance between the two Class 1 hardpoints is sizable, which may cause some trouble when mounting multiple fixed weapons since it is hard to hit with all of them at the same time. The pilot's seat of the Cobra Mk III is to the left of the centre of the ship, and has the co-pilot's to the right.

## Trivia

- The Cobra Mk III has the most amount of Livery options of any ship. Somewhat ironically, the Cobra Mk IV has the fewest.
- The Cobra Mk III has gone through several design iterations. An example of an older iteration from over a century ago can be found at a crash site at the coordinates -54.3, -50.3 on HIP 12099 1 B. It was the personal ship of the famed CMDR John Jameson, who was hired by the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm near the end of the first Thargoid conflict to deploy the mycoid bio-weapon against the alien invaders. CMDR Jameson's ship was secretly sabotaged by INRA to ensure he did not return from his mission, however.
- As of December 16, 2019, the Cobra Mk III was one of the three most popular ships in *Elite Dangerous*, the other two being the Asp Explorer and the Python.^[1]^
