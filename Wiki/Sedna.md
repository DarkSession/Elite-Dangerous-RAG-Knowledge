90377 Sedna, a large trans-Neptunian object
 		 	 

**90377 Sedna** is a large trans-Neptunian object and possible dwarf planet in the Sol system. It was discovered by Mike Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz on November 14, 2003. Sedna is about 1250-1800 km in diameter and takes roughly 10,500 years to orbit the Sun, which is much longer than most known trans-Neptunian objects. It is one of the most distant known objects in Sol. Sedna's surface temperature never rises above -240Â°C.^[1]^

The name "Sedna" originates from the Inuit goddess of the sea, who is thought to live at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean.
