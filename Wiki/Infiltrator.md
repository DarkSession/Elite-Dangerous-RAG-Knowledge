**Infiltrator**  is a career where a commander infiltrates a settlement to retrieve valuable items such as data packages. These can be done covertly by stealing the items or by attacking a target.

Infiltrators are often tasked with attacking a certain quantity of a specific settlement's defence drones known as skimmers, destroying settlement's power grid or obtaining a data package by scanning a settlement's data points via the data link scanner.

Though infiltrator missions offer a high reward, performing these actions is usually illegal and thus often result in a hefty fine or bounty. Since settlements appear on planets, the player will likely need an SRV. It should be noted that settlements vary in size and security level.

Infiltrator jobs are available at various mission boards.
