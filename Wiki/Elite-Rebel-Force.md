Elite Rebel Force (ERF or ERFS) founded in 3303^[1]^ is a Confederate Minor Faction and squadron aligned with the Federation and Jerome Archer. Their native home system^[2]^ is Altair, and the faction is home to mercenaries and bounty hunters alike.

The play style of the squadron is mixed, with a strong dedicated group in the PvP space playing into the mercenary role. These players lend their services to help Cmdrs. during community goals or in defense of their systems/factions.

The squadron has a strict Open Play only policy when it comes to Powerplay and Faction related activities (system defense, expansion, war, elections, etc.). ERF has the mindset that players should be fighting fair and square, face to face with enemies when it comes to these tasks.

*The factions main languages are German and English*

## Squadron

#### Squadron History

ERF started off as a mainly Xbox squadron in 3303 by Cmdr. Warlon Htims^[3]^ with the purpose of creating a free haven for people away from the Empires reach to defend the archetype of democracy. For these reasons, the confederate form of government was chosen to ensure the greatest possible independence of a unit.^[4]^

The faction grew to over a 100 members on console, creating a community and slowly forming a bubble around their home system. Unfortunately, with the news of console support being dropped in 3308 Squadron Cmdr. Warlon Htims and Deputy Squadron Cmdr. BreechBangClear made the difficult decision to move the group to PC to make use of the new Odyssey DLC. With this, the loss of members was significate as many Cmdrs. were unable to make this transition.

Recruitment and a training program for new pilots became the next focus of ERF to regain the numbers lost, as many other veteran Cmdrs. already had their own established squadrons.

#### Current State

As of 3310, The squadron has strong member count again with new recruits joining weekly. Recently, ERF has a slightly less active role in PvP and community goals, since as of late they prides themselves in building up new pilots. Helping them become rounded commanders in combat, trading, mining, bgs, etc., building the Elite Dangerous community more in an attempt to curve the loss of players due to the steep learning curve.

## History of Rebellion

**English:**

Ever since humanity crawled out from the primal slime, there have been rebellions against dictatorship and tyranny. These rebellions gave rise to de-centralistic federal structures and city states like those of the Greeks, Phoenicians and other tribes. The resistance against monarchies and regimes runs through the entire history of mankind up to the present day ...

In the year 3303, rebellious pilots made up of bounty hunters and mercenaries decided to join the Federation to defend the archetype of democracy. For these reasons, the form of government of confederacy was chosen to ensure the greatest possible independence of a unit. The Altair star system was chosen as the home system because it is one of the founders of the Federation and in honor for the Battle of Biggs Colony. The Elite Rebel Force was born.

**Deutsch:**

Seit die Menschheit aus dem Urschleim hervorgekrochen ist gibt es Rebellionen gegen Diktaturen und Tyrannei. Aus diesen Rebellionen entstanden dezentralistische föderale Strukturen sowie Stadtstaaten wie die der Griechen, Phönizier und anderer Volksstämme. Der Widerstand gegen Monarchien und Regime zieht sich durch die gesamte Menschheitsgeschichte bis zum heutigen Tage ...^[6]^

Im Jahr 3303 haben sich rebellische Piloten bestehend aus Kopfgeldjägern und Söldnern dazu entschlossen der Föderation beizutreten um die Urform der Demokratie zu verteidigen. Aus diesen Gründen wurde die Regierungsform des Konföderalismus gewählt um die größtmöglichste Unabhängigkeit einer Einheit zu gewährleisten. Als Heimatsystem wurde das Sternsystem Altair gewählt da es zu den Gründern der Föderation zählt und zu Ehren für die Schlacht von Biggs Colony. Die Elite Rebel Force war geboren.

On October 31st as Zachary Hudson stepped down from the presidential spot of the Federation and out of political limelight, Felicia Winters was promoted as head.

A busy year for the squadron; the move to PC has pushed the members who were able to make the move to make their presence known even more.

After continual war and struggle in this popular system, control of 61 Cygni is gained December 17th.

## Short Altair History

Altair was first colonized between 2190 and 2230. Alongside Sol, Tau Ceti, Delta Pavonis, and Beta Hydri, it was one of the original signatories of the Federal Accord of 2242 and is regarded as a founding member of the Federation. Sometime in the 31st century, Apollo Rochester, the patriarch of the prestigious Rochester family, became the biggest landowner on the planet Biggs Colony. Altair is the exclusive purveyor of the Rare Commodity Altairian Skin.
