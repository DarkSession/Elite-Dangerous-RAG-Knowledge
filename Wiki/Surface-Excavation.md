A **Surface Excavation** is a Point of Interest that can be detected from orbit and accessed On Foot or in a SRV.

## Contents

A Surface Excavation site consists of 12 Automated Mining Extractors. These extractors can be scanned with a Data Link Scanner to show their content (e.g. Gold, Silver, Indite...). Shooting an Extractor releases a "Mining Fragment", which can be collected with the SRV. The fragments show up in the inventory as a ton of the specific commodity and are considered legal salvage.

## Spawn Locations

Probably related to "Extraction" economy type. Celestial body requires some reserve.

## Notes

- Surface Excavations were introduced in *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*.
- Shooting at the extractor only destroys the ore-holding tanks; the extractor keeps firing the laser regardless.
- The mining laser fired by the extractor can destroy a stuck SRV in about 10 seconds. Use *extreme* caution when driving.
