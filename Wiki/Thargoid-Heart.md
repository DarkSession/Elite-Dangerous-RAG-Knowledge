A **Thargoid Heart** is a component occasionally found among the wreckage of destroyed Thargoid Interceptors, and can also be found in the wreckage of destroyed Thargoid Titans. The Heart is corrosive to ship modules, and can only be safely transported using a Corrosion Resistant Cargo Rack. It is considered an illegal salvage item in most systems.

It can be traded to Human Technology Brokers along with 10 Meta-Alloys to unlock the Thargoid Bobblehead.

## Notes

- As with other Thargoid commodities, a Thargoid Heart stored in a standard Cargo Rack will inflict one point of damage to the integrity of a random module every 30 seconds. Carrying multiple Thargoid commodities will cause this caustic damage effect to stack, but does not increase the frequency of the damage. Equipping modules with a resistance to the caustic damage effect, such as the Meta Alloy Hull Reinforcement, does not reduce damage from Thargoid commodities, only a Corrosion Resistant Cargo Rack provides protection.
