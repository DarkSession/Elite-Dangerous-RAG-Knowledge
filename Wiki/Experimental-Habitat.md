**Experimental Habitats** are artificial Notable Stellar Phenomena in the Colonia Region created by the Holloway Bioscience Institute to research vacuum lifeforms.^[1]^ Like Notable Stellar Phenomena, they are a type of signal source, but are unique in that their contents are excluded from the Codex due to their artificial presence and potentially temporary nature.

At present, there are a total of four Experimental Habitats, all located in uninhabited systems in the Colonia Region.^[1]^ Each Experimental Habitat features a repurposed Tourist Beacon to mark the site, a Lagrange Cloud, and a number of vacuum lifeforms. Beckett Class Science Vessel GUC-916, a Bulk Cruiser Megaship, travels between the four sites and the Colonia system.
