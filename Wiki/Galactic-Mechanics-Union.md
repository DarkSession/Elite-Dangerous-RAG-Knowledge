The **Galactic Mechanics Union** is an international trade union that represents ship repair mechanics throughout the galaxy.^[1]^

A secret investigation found that GMU conducted anti-competitive business practices such as price fixing on a galactic scale. Charges were brought against GMU by all three of the galactic major powers and millions of plaintiffs. This became known to the wider public around 10 March 3301. Ship repair costs became much cheaper due to the ongoing lawsuits.^[1]^

## Timeline

10 March 3301

- An investigation was carried out in secret by a consortium of independent investigators. They found that the GMU has been involved in anti-competitive business practices, including price fixing on a galactic scale.^[1]^
- Charges will be brought against the organisation by all three of the galaxy’s major powers. Lawsuits are in the process of being submitted to the appropriate authorities. With millions of potential plaintiffs signing up to take part in what will doubtless be the largest class action case in history, it seems unlikely that the GMU will make it out of the courts still in one piece once this is all over.
- While the lawsuits are likely to go on for years before anyone can claim any compensation, ship repair costs should start becoming significantly cheaper now that the GMU’s price fixing operations have come to an end.
