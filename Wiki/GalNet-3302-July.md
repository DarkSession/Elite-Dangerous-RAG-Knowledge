### Galactic News: Memorial to the Highliner Antares Unveiled

The Sirius Corporation has unveiled a memorial to those who lost their lives aboard the Highliner Antares, which was destroyed in 3251 during its maiden voyage. Using debris retrieved from the ship, capricious talent Delvin Hoorgan has created a striking tribute to the souls lost on the ship's inaugural flight.

The memorial depicts a stylised version of the Highliner Antares, and has been constructed using light-bending meta-materials that allow light to pass through the interior of the ship as it rotates. As the sculpture moves, the intensity of the light increases, reaching a crescendo of brilliance before subsiding.

Delvin Hoorgan waived his usual commission to participate in the project. When he unveiled the memorial, he stated he was proud to have been involved in remembering the event.

### Freelance Report: Friendly Fire over Merope 2 A

Despite assertions from Admiral Maxton Price that Federal ships in Merope would not initiate conflict, a recent incident report tells a different story.

The report claims that a clearly marked Asp Explorer science vessel was shot down, without provocation, by Federal vessels above Merope 2 A. Rescue teams from Obsidian Orbital, responding to a distress call, found the smoking wreckage of the ship a short distance from a barnacle site guarded by a Farragut Battle Cruiser and a squadron of combat ships. The pilot – a captain in the Federal Auxiliary Navy – was only slightly injured.

A spokesperson for the Federal Auxiliary Navy said: "A lone Asp with retracted weapons is no threat to a battle group, and the Navy can't shoot whomever they want without jurisdiction. If one of my boys ignored the rules of engagement like that, I'd throw the book at them. Admiral Price can expect a formal inquiry from the JAG as soon as the paperwork is done."

The Federation has not issued an official response.

### Galactic News: Empire Criticises Federal Presence in Merope

Over the past week, there has been considerable debate over the presence of Federal battle cruisers in the Merope system. The ships have taken up position near the non-human structures commonly known as barnacles, prompting censure from various sections of the galactic community.

A recent statement from Admiral Maxton Price of the Federal Navy argued that the Federal presence in Merope was "entirely legitimate". In response, Imperial Senator Zemina Torval has released a statement condemning what she says is an attempt to lay claim to the barnacles and, by extension, the meta-alloys.

"Meta-alloys are the only material capable of countering the disruptive effects of the Unknown Artefacts, and are therefore of singular value."

"There is no doubt in my mind that the Federation's decision to deploy warships in Merope represents an attempt to claim possession of the barnacles and the meta-alloys they produce. This is unacceptable."

Senator Torval refused to be drawn on what action, if any, the Empire would take in response to the Federal blockade. But given the recent conflict between the Federation and the Empire in the Daramo system, it seems likely that this development heralds further erosion of the Empire-Federation relationship.

### Freelance Report: The Jaques Rescue Mission

Recent reports indicate that a coalition of independent pilots has coordinated a mission to deliver meta-alloys to Jaques Station. A spokesperson for the group issued the following statement:

"We need your help, Commanders! Everyone's favourite cyborg barman, Jaques, has been discovered by Commander Cly in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system."

"Pilots are gathering in Maia for what will be the longest single-stop trade run in galactic history. Their mission is to deliver meta-alloys to Jaques Station and repair the damage done by the Unknown Artefacts."

"In the interests of speed and efficiency, many pilots are flying Asp Explorers. Outfitting options vary between 8 and 16 tonnes of cargo, and large fuel scoops are common among the intrepid rescue party."

"The mission's first waypoint has been designated as Synuefai PI-I c26-8. Further systems along the route will be announced soon."

### Freelance Report: Give and Take

Today marked Kumo Tribute Day, which sees representatives from systems under the control of Archon Delaine curry favour with the Pirate Lord by presenting him with lavish gifts.

Highlights included the presentation of several Imperial aristocrats, an assortment of rare narcotics and even a live barnacle. One system gifted a gold-plated Federal Corvette equipped with experimental weapons, much to the Pirate Lord's approval.

But several systems were unable to present anything of value, having fallen on difficult times. One unlucky official named Ferdinand Haim, representing the Lusonda system, arrived empty handed, pledging his system's undying loyalty as tribute. As silence descended, the Pirate Lord thanked Haim for his gift before ordering him to prove his loyalty by taking his own life.

As Haim's dead body was removed, one pirate joked: "There's always one who plays the loyalty card. Who do they think we are – the Empire?"

### Galactic News: Zachary Hudson Responds to Imperial Criticism

Yesterday, the Empire joined the debate over the Federation's decision to deploy Farragut Battle Cruisers in the Merope system. In a statement, Senator Zemina Torval asserted that the use of Federal warships represented an attempt to claim possession of the non-human structures, commonly known as barnacles, found in Merope.

Responding to this criticism, Federal President Zachary Hudson has released a statement to the media:

"Our motives are entirely altruistic. The Federal presence in the Pleiades is motivated solely by a desire to protect the non-human structures located there."

"Since the barnacles were first discovered, they have been ruthlessly exploited. Given the barnacles' value to xenobiologists, and taking into consideration the possibility that they may possess some form of sentience, this exploitation cannot be allowed to continue."

### Freelance Report: The Reclamation of Facece

After months of vicious fighting, the Imperial Naval Auxiliary has reinstated the Facece Empire Party as the controlling power of the Facece system.

Marquis Endincite, who coordinated the effort to reclaim the system, made the following statement to the Imperial Herald:

"The Empire Party has regained administration of Facece, and we beseech Imperial Commanders everywhere to ensure its continued dominance in the system. Never again should the Empire allow its pre-eminent Naval base to fall under the sway of disloyal elements."

The Allied Facece Order, which seized Facece late last year, retains control of multiple planetary and orbital stations. Fighting is likely to continue for months.

Chancellor Anders Blaine, the system's administrator, has yet to make an official statement. But he is reportedly preparing to address the Empire, and to commend Marquis Endincite and the Imperial Naval Auxiliary for their service.

### Freelance Report: Debate over Federal Intervention Continues

As the debate rages over the presence of the Federal battle cruiser Thanatos at Merope 2 A, public opinion has reached a crescendo. Commanders throughout the galaxy are weighing in. Is the Federal presence warranted?

While some Commanders applaud the Federation for its efforts to conserve the barnacles, just as many condemn the action.

One pilot, who wishes to remain anonymous but who supports the Federation, said: "Whether or not you believe the barnacles are sentient, they're currently our only known source of meta-alloys. That in itself should warrant renewable harvesting techniques, rather than the vicious exploitation that has taken place so far."

Others are just as adamant that everyone should be allowed to access the barnacles, and that the Federation has no right to place restrictions on valuable resources.

Another Commander said: "Typical Feds, sticking their nose into something that has nothing to do with them."

### Community Goal: The Rise to Power Continues

The first stage of the Rise to Power campaign is over, and the second is about to begin.

This phase of the competition will focus on what has been euphemistically referred to as commodity reallocation, with pilots being asked to gather as many technical blueprints as they can for their chosen faction. The only condition is that the technical blueprints be obtained unlawfully...which is to say stolen. The group with the most technical blueprints at the end of the event will be declared the winner.

The Rise to Power competition will run for a total of three weeks, and the victor will go on to join the ranks of the galaxy's major power players.

The event begins on the 7th of July 3302 and will run for one week.

### Galactic News: Jaques Station on the Mend

Only a week after an independent mission was launched to bring aid to Jaques Station, personnel at the starport have reported that limited repairs have been completed. A member of the station's technical team confirmed that meta-alloys had been used to partially restore the starport's commodities market, and went on to say:

"We're hugely grateful to all the pilots who have so selflessly made the long trek to Eol Prou RS-T d3-94. But we feel bad about not being able to reimburse those who schlepped out here, so we're trying to secure funds for a proper campaign to repair the starport. More details will follow soon."

Meanwhile, reports have surfaced of an increasing number of independent pilots and civilian delegations departing for Eol Prou RS-T d3-94, indicating a strong impulse to establish permanent bases in the region.

### Community Goal: Federal Expansion Campaign Begins

The Future of Segovan, a Federal organisation based in the Segovan system, has announced plans to construct a number of new Federal Naval outposts, starting in Segovan and reaching out into the Pleiades sector.

The bases will serve as resupply points for Federal vessels, and will support ongoing Federal operations in the region.

A spokesperson for the Future of Segovan said:

"This is an ambitious initiative that will only succeed with the support of the galactic community. We are therefore calling on all Federation-aligned pilots to deliver insulating membrane, gallium and power generators to our base of operations at Ramsbottom Hub, so we can start work on the first outpost."

The initiative begins on the 7th of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

### Galactic News: Order Restored to Graill Redd

The Graill Redd Liberals have announced that their campaign to clear the Graill Redd system of agitators has been a success. Hundreds of pilots responded to the appeal, taking to their ships to eliminate the communists operating in the system.

Authorities in the Graill Redd system have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation. Rewards for those who contributed to the initiative are now available for collection at J. G. Ballard Gateway.

### Galactic News: EG Pilots Victorious

Last week saw the start of the Rise to Power competition, a three-week campaign to determine which of the galaxy's largest factions wields the greatest degree of power and influence. The winner of the competition will be in a position to compete with the galaxy's major power players.

The first Rise to Power event required pilots to gather Gilya signature weapons for their chosen faction and deliver it to Gohar Station in the Jaradharre system. The week-long event saw plenty of conflict, with pilots doing everything in their power to disrupt their rivals' operations.

The final tally indicates that the EG Pilots are the winner of the first Rise to Power heat, having received the largest quantity of Gilya signature weapons. But whether the EG Pilots will claim ultimate victory remains to be seen.

### Freelance Report: Border Coalition Backs SEPP

In an emergency meeting at Iren's Dock on the 3rd of July 3302, the Border Coalition presented the Manite-Piscium-Pact to an assembly of interested parties. The outcome was a unanimous decision to back the Social Eleu Progressive Party in the Rise to Power campaign. The vote was swayed by a personal intervention from Duke Tiberius of Mikunn, who said:

"We believe in exploration, colonization and scientific discovery. These ideas are bigger than Mikunn or Manite, bigger than the Border Coalition, bigger even than the outer colonies. For this reason the Border Coalition will be backing the SEPP in its bid for power."

The Border Coalition evidently hopes that the faction that triumphs in the Rise to Power share its belief in the value of peaceful exploration, colonization and scientific discovery – a view shared by a significant number of other influential factions.

A diplomatic summit is scheduled for Wednesday the 13th of July 3302 to discuss which options would be considered in the event of a GalCop victory, including a full backing of the EG Pilots.

### Freelance Report: Strategic Resource Denial

General Alexander Lee, recently retired from United Teaka First, made a guest appearance on the independent talk show Affairs of State this weekend. General Lee responded to questions regarding Federal fleets stationed at barnacle sites.

"Strategic resource acquisition and denial is key in any conflict. It is accomplished by taking resource-rich territory by force, by destroying one's own resources when in retreat, and various other means. The presence of Federation warships at barnacle sites follows this strategic behaviour."

"It doesn't take a grand strategist to see what's happening. The Federation has secured a key strategic asset – the only resource known to counter damage inflicted by Unknown Artefacts. Even if the Federation doesn't intend to collect the meta-alloys, the Empire will be forced to respond by either securing alternative sites, or by contesting current Federation claims. In either case, Independent systems afflicted by UA malfunctions will continue to suffer."

### Galactic News: Federal Citizens Call for Halsey's Release

A growing proportion of the Federation's population is clamouring for the release of former Federal president Jasmina Halsey, who is currently a patient at a secure psychiatric facility on Mars. Despite assertions from Halsey's personal staff that the former president entered the facility of her own volition, an increasingly large section of the galactic community apparently holds the view that she was hospitalised not for the good of her health, but in order to silence her.

One of those calling for Halsey's release said:

"It seems even former presidents aren't allowed to speak the truth. Jasmina Halsey is right – we should keep expanding, pushing out into space – but the Federal government isn't interested. And now they've had her imprisoned."

There has been increased discussion on newsfeeds over the past week concerning the former Federal president, and crowds of people have begun congregating outside the Clearwater Clinic, protesting her confinement.

### Freelance Report: Federal Expansion Ignites Controversy

The announcement of Federal plans to expand into the Pleiades Nebula, and the Federation's call for the support of independent pilots, has ignited a firestorm of controversy. Although there is support for the Federation's goals, many have expressed reservations.

One Commander, who wished to remain anonymous due to his rank in the Federal Naval Reserve, clarified his concerns:

"The Federation has a history of concealment when it comes to discoveries suggesting the existence of non-human entities."

"We don't know how long Federal scientists have been experimenting with the Unknown Artefacts and Unknown Probes, but we do know they came to public awareness when they fell out of Federation vessels. We don't know much about the barnacles, but we know the Federation has set up perimeters around them."

"I believe in the Federation," he continued, "but there is an element within it that wants to cover up important information about humanity's place in the galaxy. That information belongs to everyone. We must demand increased transparency and openness before allowing the Federation to assume greater influence."

### Freelance Report: Federal Expansion Brought to a Halt

The Federal expansion campaign has been brought to a complete standstill.

Ramsbottom Hub in the Segovan system has entered a state of lockdown, and many independent Commanders who had loaded up on commodities are now unable to complete their deliveries.

The Federation has yet to make an official announcement, but reports have been flooding in from the galactic community on possible causes for the lockdown. Some pilots claim they were attacked by Imperial vessels, while others maintain it was pirates.

Almost 4,000 pilots have contributed over 3.5 million tonnes between them. Now those Commanders are stuck with nowhere to deliver the requested commodities, and are understandably frustrated.

The Federation is receiving the brunt of the backlash. Some are saying that Federal expansion on this scale was always going to receive opposition from the Empire, while others maintain that the Federation should have prepared for this eventuality by offering multiple ports of delivery and better security.

One Commander said: "I'm here to protect the barnacles – I don't care about Feds or Imps. This is a prime example of politics getting in the way of what's truly important. They need to get off their high horses and discuss how we can protect the barnacles."

Commander BluWolve

### Galactic News: Federal Campaign Resumes

Four days ago, the Federation launched a campaign to construct a new Federal outpost in the Segovan system. Federally aligned pilots were invited to contribute construction materials to the campaign, but the request proved controversial, with various sections of the galactic community asking why the Federation was expanding towards the Pleiades sector.

Not long after the campaign began, Imperial pilots began targeting traders delivering cargo to the Ramsbottom Hub starport. As the situation escalated, system authorities imposed a system-wide lockdown in an attempt to maintain order. Ramsbottom Hub was closed, and pilots wanting to deliver materials were left with no way of contributing to the campaign. Authorities insisted that the lockdown was intended to keep the system's inhabitants safe, but Federal pilots were understandably frustrated.

Recent reports from Segovan indicate that the Federation has now despatched a deputation to the system – including two Farragut-class Battlecruisers – and convinced system authorities to lift the lockdown. A Federal spokesperson said:

"The lockdown had a negative impact on our campaign, certainly, but the huge quantity of material delivered to Ramsbottom Hub prior to the lockdown means we are still confident we can meet our baseline targets."

"With the lockdown now removed, we would like to renew our plea to Federally aligned pilots to support this vitally important initiative."

### Freelance Report: Taskforce Athena Locks Down Segovan

In a move likely to further inflame relations between the superpowers, a coalition of Empire-aligned Commanders has declared the Segovan system a no-fly zone. Ramsbottom Hub, the site of an ongoing Federation construction project, has been placed in security lockdown, and traders have been advised that services are currently unavailable.

Commander Kyrthak, a spokesman for Taskforce Athena, the coalition imposing the no-fly zone, made the following statement:

"The actions of the Future of Segovan represent an unbridled attempt to project force into the Pleiades and further exploit the region's Unknown Artefacts and meta-alloys. Taskforce Athena is actively combating Federal security services in order to halt construction of these new Federal outposts. If the Federation continues down this path, it will cost them dearly."

The Federation has placed heavy bounties on the offending Commanders.

### Galactic News: Imperial Ships to Enter Merope

Following a recent statement from Senator Zemina Torval in which the seasoned politician criticised the deployment of Federal battlecruisers in the Merope system, Admiral Denton Patreus has entered the debate. At a hastily organised press conference on Capitol, Admiral Patreus addressed the Federal intervention:

"Like Senator Torval, I believe that the Federal presence in Merope represents an attempt to lay claim to the system's non-human structures. This will not stand. An Imperial deputation will therefore be mobilised and despatched to the Merope system. I will take personal command of the fleet, which will depart within the month."

Patreus did not clarify whether the Imperial ships would engage the Federal fleet, or simply establish a counter-blockade. But one thing is for sure: this development can only serve to heighten tensions between the Federation and the Empire.

### Galactic News: Federal Campaign Derailed Again

Reports coming in from the Segovan system indicate that the Federation's campaign to construct an outpost in the system has once again been disrupted. Starport personnel have confirmed that the station is experiencing a wide range of technical problems as a result of Unknown Artefact-related interference.

You almost have to admire those Imperial pilots," said one member of starport personnel. "I mean, it's a pain in the ass for us – we've got malfunctions and power outages popping up all over the place – but you've got to respect their determination. First they tried targeting the traders. Then they hit the station with Unknown Artefacts."

Starport authorities were unable to confirm when services at the station would be restored. Meanwhile, Federal President Zachary Hudson issued a statement:

"The individuals responsible for this cowardly attack clearly care nothing for the people of Ramsbottom Hub, whose lives have been severely disrupted. These people are terrorists, pure and simple."

"I want to assure the people of Ramsbottom Hub, and all Federal citizens, that we will find the individuals responsible, and we will make them pay."

## 14 JUL

### Galactic News: Federal Campaign Concludes

The Future of Segovan has announced that its appeal for construction materials has reached a successful conclusion, despite repeated attempts from Imperial pilots to disrupt the campaign. Large quantities of gallium and insulating membrane, and hundreds of tonnes of power generators, were delivered to Ramsbottom Hub, the organisation's base of operations, allowing work to begin on the first of a series of new Federal outposts.

A spokesperson for the Future of Segovan said:

"The Federation's opponents went to great lengths to try to stop this operation, but ultimately they failed. The construction of this outpost will proceed as planned."

### Community Goal: Searching for Barnacles

Since the non-human structures known as barnacles were first discovered, they have prompted fierce debate, attracted intense scrutiny and even triggered the despatch of a Federal Fleet to the Merope system.

As the only known source of meta-alloys, the barnacles are of considerable value. It is therefore unsurprising that the Empire has issued an appeal for exploration data in the hope of finding more. A spokesperson for Bava Blue Travel Systems, which is coordinating the campaign, made the following statement:

"The barnacles are of central importance, and it is vital that we determine whether or not there are any more out there. We are therefore launching an appeal for exploration data, to begin at once, as part of a search for further barnacles."

The spokesperson was asked if the campaign had been prompted by the Federation's decision to station battle cruisers at barnacle sites in the Merope system, but she declined to comment.

Bava Blue Travel Systems, on behalf of the Empire, has promised to reward pilots who deliver exploration data to Bauschinger City in the Bava system. The campaign begins on the 14th of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the Empire's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

### Galactic News: EG Pilots win Second Rise to Power Event

The second heat of the Rise to Power campaign is over. For this event, pilots were asked to head to the Nervi system and gather technical blueprints for their chosen faction. The one condition imposed on the pilots was that the technical blueprints must be stolen – a stipulation that gave rise to a number of clashes with Nervi security forces.

The final tally indicates that the largest quantity of technical blueprints was received by the EG Pilots, making them the winner of this stage of the campaign. But whether or not the EG Pilots will win the Rise to Power competition remains to be seen, as it will not be clear which faction has received the most support until the end of the campaign.

The Rise to Power competition will run for one more week, and the victor will go on to join the ranks of the galaxy's major power players.

### Community Goal: The Rise to Power Concludes

The third and final stage of the Rise to Power campaign is about to begin.

For this heat, pilots have been asked to salvage precious gems and deliver them to Laura Elizabeth in the Meropis system. But the event organisers have chosen to complicate matters by refusing to reveal the precise whereabouts of the salvage site. Pilots participating in the event have been given just one clue to its location - the following signal:

353133313639313835 3432313232313132 31393235313932303531333139 A6B1D4H1I4K1L1M2N1O2R1U1V1Y1Z1 3132313533313132 373131323134353230 32353133313531343139

The group that manages to accumulate the most precious gems will be declared the winner of the final Rise to Power event. At the close of the event, the results of each heat will be reviewed. The faction that has garnered the most support over the course of the campaign will join the ranks of the galaxy's major power players.

The event begins on the 14th of July 3302 and will run for one week.

### Galactic News: The Origin of the Alliance

In a return to our popular series on significant episodes from human history, noted historian Sima Kalhana discusses the foundation of the Alliance.

"The Alliance may champion the ideals of harmony and independence, but it is very much the product of violence."

"Alioth, the Alliance powerbase, was once a highly contested system. In the decades that followed its colonisation, it was the site of almost constant conflict between the Federation and the Empire. Naturally this made life difficult for the system's inhabitants, whose lives were impacted by generation after generation of war."

"The turning point came in 3228, when the Federal corporations supplying one of Alioth's main population centres attempted to raise prices. This triggered a revolt. Federal and Imperial forces were despatched to quell the uprising, but the resistance, bolstered by fighters from neighbouring independent systems, successfully repelled them. Ultimately the Empire chose to withdraw from the system, reluctant to commit to a potentially protracted campaign far from its centre of power. When the Federation realised how unpopular the war had become among Federal citizens, it followed suit."

"In the wake of the conflict, the idea of an independent socio-political body rapidly gained popularity among the people of Alioth, and in 3230 the Alliance of Independent Systems was established. Its founding principles were simple: to protect and support those who wanted to remain independent of the Federation and the Empire, and to empower its member systems while simultaneously preserving their independence. Over the next two decades, more than twenty systems joined the Alliance."

"Today, the Alliance is widely seen as a paragon of democracy in an increasingly autocratic galaxy. It is governed by a body known as the Alliance Assembly, the primary function of which is to establish common policies and treaties among the Alliance's member systems, and act as an arbitration body when necessary. The notional head of the Assembly is the prime minister, but in reality it is the Council of Admirals that wields the greatest degree of power."

"The Council of Admirals is a six-person body comprising the leaders of the six largest military forces in the Alliance. In addition to selecting the prime minister, the Council also commands the Alliance Defence Force, a vast flotilla of ships contributed by each of the Alliance's member systems. The Council of Admirals is free to deploy the Defence Force without the approval of the Assembly, making it extremely powerful."

"There can be no argument that the Alliance lacks the power-projection abilities of the Empire and the Federation. But it is more than capable of competing with them in economic and political terms, and of defending its member systems when necessary."

It has been two months since former Federal president Jasmina Halsey was admitted to the Clearwater Clinic psychiatric facility on Mars. Halsey's admission followed a period of bizarre behaviour, during which she claimed to have encountered super-intelligent beings in the depths of space.

Since then, a proportion of the Federal population has been calling for the former president's release, claiming that she was hospitalised not for the good of her health but in order to silence her. This suggestion was dismissed as "patently ridiculous" by Halsey's personal staff, but this did little to deter those campaigning for Halsey's freedom.

Now it seems the campaigners have got their wish. Today, Jasmina Halsey left the Clearwater Clinic of her own volition, having been deemed ready to return to society by her doctors.

President Halsey was met at the entrance of the clinic by a crowd of supporters, to whom she gave a brief statement:

"I would like to thank the staff of this fine institution for helping me during this troubled time. It's fair to say I haven't quite been myself recently, and I apologise wholeheartedly for any distress I might have caused."

### Freelance Report: The Silent Arbiter

As Utopia completes its mission in the Maia system, senior Utopian figures have voiced alarm at the deteriorating situation between the Federation and the Empire over the barnacles. One member of the commune said:

"We are surrounded by a galactic mystery. Recent events indicate that humanity may not be alone in the universe."

"Some believe we are being stalked by monsters. Others think we will soon encounter a higher intelligence. We must be optimistic, and meet the future – whatever it may hold – with a collective voice."

"I believe humanity is being watched, its actions noted. Soon, we will be judged. Our survival depends on the decisions we make right now. We must not, and cannot, fight among ourselves."

### Freelance Report: The Demands of Supply

"Commanders are advised to search within nebulae for rocky or high-metal content worlds with a composition of between 66.5% and 99.1% rock and 8.9% and 33.5% metal, with 0% ice. Temperatures between 194K and 451K should be sought. To narrow the field, Commanders should also seek bodies with gravity between 0.06g and 0.3g."

This text is taken from 'Barnacle Search Criteria', a recent publication from the Canonn Interstellar Research Group.

Commentators are divided on what impact, if any, this information will have on the increasingly volatile situation in and around the Merope system. But many agree that if the barnacles are being viewed as a finite resource, the Canonn's data may serve to defuse tensions, at least temporarily.

The publication of the criteria is believed to have followed a private conference between Dr Arcanonn and Professor Cora Shaw, director of the Palin Institute. Dr Arcanonn commented:

"We must not let the drums of war drown out the fact that the stated positions of the Federation and the Empire are, upon review, far from irreconcilable."

### Freelance Report: Jacques Barnacle Search

The discovery of Jacques Station has prompted many Commanders to load up on meta-alloys and start the long trek to Eol Prou RS-T d3-94.

One group that has already made it has begun searching the area for barnacles. If the structures are found, they could provide Jacques with the meta-alloys needed to fix the station.

Some Commanders remain sceptical, arguing that the barnacles are engineered and won't be found in the system, but that hasn't stopped the search from going ahead. For many it is not a question of 'if' barnacles will found it – it is a question of 'when'. One of the searchers said:

"It makes sense there would be barnacles out here – the system has many of the conditions required. But searching for them is a big job. Any assistance from pilots in the area is welcome."

### Freelance Report: Moon-Landing Anniversary Race

The historical re-enactment society Ex Luna Scientia has partnered with the Buckyball Racing Club to organise a commemorative race celebrating the 1,333rd anniversary of the first landing on Earth's Moon.

The Fly Me to the Moon race will run from the 19th to the 21st of July and will start at Lem Dock in the Chaac system. The finish line is at Moon Prospect in the Turot system, where participants will compete in surface racing in their rovers.

The race is open to everyone, from regular Buckyballers to first-time racers. The race committee has suggested that, due to the risks involved, all participants take out full insurance coverage.

### Freelance Report: Meta-Alloy Rush

As the Federation and Empire attempt to lay claim to the organic structures known as barnacles, the demand for meta-alloys has skyrocketed. Many starports have begun placing orders for the material as a hedge against potential malfunctions.

Vernon Trask, lead engineer at Bauschinger City, said: "Some stations have been defunct for nearly a year because of those corrosive Artefacts. We can't afford to be out of commission that long."

"Quite a few stations in the Empire have open orders for meta-alloys, including Bauschinger. We're hoping to get ahead of this techno-plague before it bites us."

This 'meta-alloy rush' has alarmed conservationists and researchers concerned about the future of the barnacles.

"We know so little about the barnacles," said Dr Elana Lorax, a noted xenobiologist. "We don't know how they grow, how long they live or how they create meta-alloys. If the exploitation continues at this rate, we may never know."

### Galactic News: Unknown Probe Breakthrough

The Canonn Interstellar Research Group has announced that one of its scientists has made a discovery regarding the so-called Unknown Probes.

According to a statement, a pilot by the name of Commander Rizal72 has confirmed that when the mysterious objects are examined with an advanced discovery scanner, they emit an electro-magnetic pulse that temporarily incapacitates the scanning ship. The pulse is followed by a brief burst of sound, similar in nature to the 'chittering' produced by the Unknown Artefacts.

Following this announcement, Commander Rizal72's colleagues at the Canonn Interstellar Research Group began subjecting recordings of the sound to various tests. They soon discovered that the sound contained an encrypted image, which some have interpreted as a depiction of interstellar bodies.

The meaning of the image, and the origin and purpose of the Probes, remains unclear. Clearly, there remains much to discover.

### Freelance Report: Barnacles under Assault

The recent meta-alloy rush has left many of the barnacles in the Pleiades Nebula barren.

As many scramble to meet the high demand for the material, it seems the Federation lacks the resources to provide adequate defence.

Federal vessels have reportedly transported huge quantities of meta-alloys from the Merope system, suggesting that it may be partly responsible for the drought.

One independent researcher said:

"As far as we know, a barnacle will 'regenerate' after one week, although we don't know if this is always the case."

"Research indicates that harvesting only 'ripe' spikes will keep the barnacle healthy. A simple scan and visual check will confirm spike maturity."

"Further testing will be needed to determine the specifics, but with the crisis facing civilised space, conducting controlled experiments on barnacles has become next to impossible."

"The way things are going, we risk losing these magnificent entities for good."

### Community Goal: A Majestic Development

Lavigny's Legion, an Imperial organisation based in the Carthage system, has launched a campaign to add three new Majestic-class Interdictors to the Imperial fleet.

At a press conference, Lucius Lavigny confirmed that the Emperor had personally authorised the campaign. According to Lavigny, the initiative is a direct response to the Federation's "ongoing military build-up". The admiral closed the conference with the words: "We must continue to strengthen our fleet and reinforce our garrisons."

Lavigny's Legion has placed an open order for thallium, thermal cooling units and CMM composites for use in the construction, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested material to Marker Depot in the Carthage system. The campaign begins on the 21st of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the Empire's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

### Community Goal: Restoring Order in Carthage

Authorities in the Carthage system have reported a sharp increase in the number of criminals operating in the area. To ensure these agitators do not disrupt the Lavigny's Legion campaign, a kill order has been placed on all wanted ships operating in the system. Lavigny's Legion has promised to reward pilots who deliver bounty vouchers to Marker Depot.

The campaign begins on the 21st of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

### Galactic News: EG Pliots win Rise to Power

The third and final heat of the Rise to Power campaign is over.

For this stage of the competition, pilots were asked to recover salvaged precious gems and deliver them to Laura Elizabeth in the Meropis system. Matters were complicated by the fact that the event organisers refused to reveal the precise whereabouts of the salvage site, giving just a single clue to its location.

Once the location was found, a desperate race began as pilots urgently ferried the gems to the Laura Elizabeth starport in support of their chosen faction. Ultimately, it was the EG Pilots who received the most salvaged precious gems and claimed victory. But the celebrations were short-lived, as the EG Pilots waited tensely for the announcement of the overall victor.

Now that the results of each heat have been reviewed, the event organisers have announced that the winner of the Rise to Power campaign is...the EG Pilots.

Trinity Avon, reporting for The Sovereign, commented on what has proved to be an exciting competition:

"The EG Pilots have shown that they has the necessary strength and influence to be recognised as a power in their own right. I for one look forward to seeing what the future holds."

### Galactic News: Imperial Campaign Concludes

A spokesperson for Bava Blue Travel Systems has announced that hundreds of independent pilots responded to the recent Imperial appeal for exploration data, delivering large quantities of astronomical information to Bauschinger City in the Bava system. The appeal was part of an Imperial campaign to locate further barnacles, the only known source of meta-alloys.

In a brief statement, the spokesperson thanked the many Commanders who supported the campaign:

"We are immensely grateful to all the intrepid explorers who contributed to this initiative. Your data will now be analysed to see if it can reveal the location of further barnacle sites. Of course, this process is not an exact science, so it may take some time. We will keep the galactic community abreast of our progress."

### Community Goal: Repair Jaques Station

Jaques, the owner and operator of Jaques Station, has issued an appeal for commodities to repair his beleaguered starport.

The station has been in poor shape ever since Jaques made an unsuccessful attempt to travel to Beagle Point. Since then, a number of independent pilots have voluntarily delivered meta-alloys to the station, resulting in the reopening of the starport's commodities market. But to restore the starport to full functionality, a full-scale campaign is needed. In a statement, Jaques said:

"We're very grateful to all the pilots who brought us meta-alloys over the past few weeks. But to get the station back online, we're also going to need power generators, tantalum, structural regulators and energy grid assemblies. So we're asking all pilots to deliver whatever they can."

Jaques has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested materials to Jaques Station in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. The campaign begins on the 21st of July 3302 and will run for four weeks. If Jaques's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

### Freelance Report: Probe Research Implications

Recent developments in Unknown Probe research have raised concerns among military strategists.

Today, Captain Alexis Corvus of Task Force Athena briefed the Imperial Senate on the implications of an offensively deployed Unknown Probe.

"The offensive potential of these Probes mustn't be underestimated. A single fighter with a discovery scanner and a probe in its cargo hold could potentially disable dozens of spacecraft. A customized torpedo designed to similarly trigger its payload could be even more disruptive, allowing a hostile fleet to prey on the disabled vessels."

"The zeal with which the Federation has been collecting resources like these probes leads me to believe they have already considered these use cases. Moreover, the stationing of no fewer than five Farragut-class Battlecruisers in Merope suggests this matter is of grave importance to them. If we mean to maintain the status quo, we must act prudently."

### Freelance Report: A Year of Buckyball Racing

The Buckyball Racing Club was formed, one year ago, to provide a schedule of races involving a wide variety of pilots. In its first year the club hosted a total of 28 races, and to celebrate it is hosting one of its craziest yet: the BuckyBubble!

Commemorating the club's most famous race, the A\* Challenge, the BuckyBubble starts at Lomas Station in the Wolf 359 system. Racers will navigate a route that passes through 60 systems loosely resembling the shape of a buckyball molecule.

Pilots are invited to join the chaos from the 23rd of July to the 7th of August.

### Galactic News: Knives Drawn

With the Federal-Imperial relationship currently on unsteady ground, political commentators have been reviewing recent events and offering their analyses of the current situation.

Most agree that the turning point came in March, when the Federation began construction of a new Farragut-class Battlecruiser in the Beta Hydri system. The Empire made no response to the development at first, but an anonymous Imperial source was quoted as saying: "If the Federation embarked on a campaign of military fortification, it's likely the Empire would respond in kind." A short time later, the Empire started work on a new Majestic-class Interdictor.

Conflict erupted in June, when Imperial forces attempted to take possession of the Federation-controlled Daramo system. The Federation was able to rebuff the offensive in just three days, however, prompting one high-ranking Federal officer to comment: "Hopefully this episode will remind our enemies that they cannot simply take whatever they want."

A few weeks later, the Federation deployed a number of Farragut-class Battlecruisers to the Merope system. The ships took up position near the non-human structures commonly known as barnacles, prompting outrage from various sections of the galactic community. The Federation insisted its intention was to protect the sites, but the Empire remained unconvinced, accusing the Federation of trying to take possession of the barnacles. Shortly thereafter, the Empire announced that it too would despatch a deputation to Merope.

Commentators generally agree that the meta-alloys have now become a focus for Federal-Imperial antagonism. While it has been confirmed that the meta-alloys can counter the harmful effects of the Unknown Artefacts, no other applications for the material have been found. But speculation abounds that there may be as-yet undiscovered uses for the remarkable substance. The fact that the Federation has announced plans to construct a number of outposts in the Pleiades sector – one of the primary locations of meta-alloys – is further evidence that it has a keen interest in the material.

As tensions between the two superpowers increase, only one thing can be stated with certainty: in the competition for control of the meta-alloys, the Federation has taken the lead.

### Freelance Report: Could Halsey Shake up Federal Politics?

Following the release of former Federal president Jasmina Halsey from the Clearwater Clinic, commentators from around the galaxy are asking the same question: What's next for Halsey?

According to political analyst Emilio Blythe: "If Halsey were to return to politics, it could spell trouble for Shadow President Felicia Winters. Winters's leadership of the Liberal Party has been questioned over the last few months, and Halsey could conceivably retake control of the party."

Meanwhile, members of the religious cult known as The Hands of the Architects are holding onto the hope that Halsey will take on the mantle of prophet, and lead them to 'communion with the Architects'.

Attempts to contact the former president have been rebuffed by her staff.

### Freelance Report: GalCop Mobilizes to Aid Jaques Station

Since contact with Jaques Station was re-established, a substantial effort from independent pilots to deliver meta-alloys to the stricken starport has returned it to partial functionality.

With the commodities market now open, Jaques has issued an appeal for the components needed to restore his station to full operational status. The Galactic Cooperative of Worlds has pledged to ensure the success of the initiative, having secured a logistical supply chain and established an operational beachhead in the surrounding sectors.

Jahena Yar Savor, GalCop's Chief Executive Officer, said that the Cooperative would "establish a localised resource base in the systems surrounding Jaques in order to offset the financial burden of securing these resources. Many of our pilots and member organisations acquired substantial wealth during the Dangerous Games, and we thought it would only be fair to use these assets to aid a friend."

### Freelance Report: The August Exodus

With the possibility of war between the Federation and the Empire looming, a number of intrepid explorers have banded together to establish a new way of life among the stars. Over 300 pilots from across inhabited space have signed up to take part in the largest convoy ever assembled, designated the August Exodus – A Jaunt to Jaques.

The first convoy, comprising 250 pilots, set off from the Ocshooit system on the 24th of July, and is expected to reach Jaques Station within two weeks. The second convoy is being assembled, and almost 60 pilots have signed up so far. It will depart on the 15th of August.

It is hoped that this monumental effort will not only return Jaques Station to full operational power, but also usher in the birth of a new colony in the Colonia Nebula, where Jaques is currently located.

### Galactic News: Latest Imperial Campaign Concludes

Lavigny's Legion, an Imperial organisation based in the Carthage system, has announced that its appeal for construction materials has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of independent pilots supported the campaign by delivering thallium, thermal cooling units and CMM composites to Marker Depot in the Carthage system. The organisation is now in a position to proceed with its campaign to construct three new Majestic-class Interdictors.

### Community Goal: New Federal Outpost

Three weeks ago, the Federation ignited controversy with its decision to establish a series of outposts in the Pleiades sector. The development triggered a decisive response from Empire-aligned pilots, who made repeated attempts to destabilise the campaign. Ultimately, the Federation was able to complete the operation, but the Federation's opponents had made their feelings clear – the superpower's military expansion would not proceed unopposed.

Now the Federation has announced plans to establish a new planetary outpost in the HIP 17225 system, which it claims will serve as "a trade and resource-processing hub". Those familiar with HIP 17225 A 1 will be all too aware that the planet is home to a number of barnacle sites.

The Federation has placed an open order for tantalum, building fabricators and energy grid assemblies with which to construct the new base, and has authorised the Future of Segovan to reimburse pilots who deliver these materials to Obsidian Orbital in the Maia system.

The campaign begins on the 28th of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the Federation's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

### Community Goal: Establishing a Base in Eol Prou

The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction has launched a campaign to establish a planetary outpost in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. According to the organisation's spokesperson, the primary purpose of the new outpost will be to support independent trade and exploration in the region.

In a statement, the spokesperson elaborated on the nature of the campaign:

"Well, the arrival of Jaques triggered a real surge in interest in Eol Prou. And since the system is pretty remote, there's a clear need for an outpost to support pilots ferrying material to and from the starport. That's in the short term. There's also a desire among the galactic community to establish a permanent presence in Eol Prou, so hopefully this campaign will be the start of something bigger."

The 80 DD-D 774-CE-2 faction has placed an open order for mined osmium for use in the construction, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver materials to Jaques Station in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. The campaign begins on the 28th of July 3302 and will run for four weeks.

### Community Goal: Empire Appeals for Meta-Alloys

As the galaxy becomes increasingly focused on the meta-alloys, the Empire has issued a galaxy-wide request for the controversial material. A spokesperson for the Zagoro Imperial Society, which is coordinating the appeal, released the following statement:

"We don't yet know all the applications of the meta-alloys, but their ability to counter the harmful effects of the Unknown Artefacts indicates a potentially significant relationship between them, the Artefacts and, presumably, the unknown probes. It would therefore be unwise to let anyone to establish a monopoly on this material."

"By supporting this initiative, you can help ensure that humankind is ideally positioned to meet the future – whatever it may hold."

It is presumably not immaterial that the Empire's initiative coincides with a Federal campaign to establish a new outpost on the planet HIP 17225 A 1 – a known barnacle site.

The Zagoro Imperial Society has promised to reward pilots who deliver meta-alloys to Axon Station in the Zagoro system. The campaign begins on the 28th of July 3302 and will run for one week. If the Empire's targets are met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

### Galactic News: Jasmina Halsey Returns to Public Life

At a recent charity event, former Federal president Jasmina Halsey made her first public appearance since she was discharged from a secure psychiatric facility on Mars two weeks ago. The woman seen at the event differed dramatically from the frail individual seen leaving the Clearwater Clinic. Some commented that she appeared even more confident than when she was in office.

After the event, reporters asked President Halsey what she has planned for the future.

"I know that many of you have been perplexed by my recent statements, but having reflected on my experiences, I have accepted that what I saw might not have been literally real. I do believe, however, that the message contained in those experiences is valid, and that I have a duty to share that message."

"As a species we have learned nothing from our history. We plundered the Earth for its treasures, treating it with callous indifference, and now we stumble blindly into space in pursuit of wealth and glory. And all the while we are heedless of the damage we cause."

"We remain a violent species, unable to cooperate, and we are therefore deprived of the prosperity that true peace would bring."

Halsey further surprised reporters by stating that she had recently met with Alliance Prime Minster Edmund Mahon, and that she would soon be relocating to a system within Alliance space.

### Galactic News: The Origin of the Pilots Federation

Continuing our popular series on significant episodes from human history, noted historian Sima Kalhana discusses the foundation of the Pilots Federation.

"The Pilots Federation was established in 2805 in response to a surge in private-starship ownership. It was created principally to allow pilots to share reliable trade-route information, and to provide them with a system of mutual protection against the rising scourge of interstellar piracy."

"At the time, independent pilots were generally mistrusted, the itinerant nature of their profession giving rise to perceptions of irresponsibility. The Pilots Federation's strict code of conduct put an end to this, and over time a galaxy-wide respect for its members emerged."

"As piracy became more prevalent, the Pilots Federation started issuing bounties on known pirate vessels. Some of those outside the organisation condemned the initiative as bloodthirsty, but few were able to argue with the impact it had on piracy. Shortly thereafter, the Pilots Federation introduced an official ranking system to reflect the number of combat victories achieved by each of its members. Pilots who accumulated the largest number of kills were awarded the title of Elite – a citation that became highly coveted among independent pilots."

"The Pilots Federation derives the bulk of its wealth from the GalNet data network. Originally a system of ship, bounty and star-chart data, it evolved into an interstellar aggregator of market information and galactic news. By 3300, the Pilots Federation was not only the dominant provider of this information, it was also the main manufacturer of the hardware and software serving this data. Today, Pilots Federation systems are fitted as standard on virtually all independent starships."

"In 3290 the Pilots Federation expanded its ranking system to encompass the fields of trade and exploration. In 3301 it expanded it again to include pilots who had distinguished themselves in the Close Quarters Combat championships."

"The Pilots Federation has always remained politically neutral, avowing that it exists to support pilots rather than nationalities or political factions. The organisation is based in the Shinrarta Dezhra system, which can be accessed only by invitation. Receiving an invitation is typically dependent on achieving a high rank in the Pilots Federation. This stipulation has contributed to perceptions of the organisation as secretive – a perception compounded by the fact that the Pilots Federation has very little direct interaction with the public."

### Galactic News: Edmund Mahon Condemns Imperial-Federal Sabre Rattling

Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon has offered a critical appraisal of the ongoing antagonism between the Empire and the Federation. His comments, delivering during a recent ministerial address, concern the conflict over the organic structures known as barnacles, and the meta-alloys they produce.

The pertinent part of his address is reprinted below:

"Our history contains no shortage of bloodshed. Territory, resources – we have gone to war over these things far too often."

"We have expanded into the cosmos, made a home among the stars, created a civilisation spanning thousands of light years. Have we left our pettiness and greed behind, or have we brought them with us? I believe we are capable of working together to create a truly unified society. But the Empire and the Federation do not appear to share this view."

"I implore my friends in the Empire and the Federation to look beyond their immediate concerns and consider the ramifications of their actions. The organic structures may well be the product of a non-human civilisation. They, and the meta-alloys, should be afforded our protection."

"We could be on the brink of a new era of discovery. This is no time for military posturing."
