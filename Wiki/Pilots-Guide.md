The Codex shows information and stats of your findings, progress, session logs and a curated archive of your discoveries.

The Homepage has the most important stats with a full body image of your Commander. You can customize the appearance with Holo-Me.

The Discoveries section shows 42 galactic regions with things that players found and things that aren't discovered yet. For example within a star system there are stars, planets, terrestrials, gas giants, species, settlements, generation ships, text and audio logs etc.

The Knowledge Base has encyclopedia-style lore topics about e.g. historical events, important characters, factions and alien species.

The Pilot's Handbook has detailed information about possible activities, ship outfitting and more. There's also a news feed.

ED also creates log files every time you play. These tools can pull that data in various ways to give you a detailed log of everywhere you go, buy and sell, and other player actions.
