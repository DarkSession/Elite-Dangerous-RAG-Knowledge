## Combat Bonds

Combat Bond Vouchers are monetary rewards earned through faction combat in Conflict Zones (Power Conflict Zones too).

### Overview

##### Special for Power Conflict Zones

In Power Conflict Zones, the faction you are assigned on is the one you are pledged to in Powerplay. The Combat Bonds that you gain in a Power Conflict Zone for a power can be redeemed for Credits at the Combat Bond contact on a Stronghold carrier of this Power.

##### General for Combat Zones

Upon dropping from Supercruise into a Conflict Zone, the player can select their preferred minor faction in a special tab that appears in the Comms panel. Ships belonging to the selected faction become allied, while ships belonging to the other faction become hostile and begin targeting the player.

Combat Bond Vouchers are earned with each ship that the player destroys. They can be redeemed for credits through the Contacts section of the station services menu at stations controlled by the minor faction that issued the bond. As with Bounty Vouchers, bonds are also awarded for assisted kills.

Combat Bond Vouchers are also earned in On-Foot Conflict Zones for killing enemy combatants. The rewards vary depending on the zone's intensity. On-Foot Combat Bond Vouchers can only be redeemed at Frontline Solutions in the concourse of a station.

### Bond values

The value of rewarded bonds for destroyed ships is fixed and depends upon ship type, where heavier ships tend to be more valuable.

### Tips and Tactics

- The reward range for combat bond vouchers seems meager compared to bounty vouchers. However note that you are in a co-operative battle.
    - Prioritize Federal Corvettes, Imperial Cutters, Anacondas and Pythons. If there are none in scanner range, use "Select highest threat" targeting control to find your next target, regardless of their Combat Bond value - at least one or more Friendlies will engage same target, giving you a wingman - this makes fighting bigger ships much easier. Because this is a co-operative battle it is acceptable to get in on kills etc.
    - By continuously eliminating the same target as NPC Friendlies, you will be able to establish a power ball of friendly ships, which will steamroll around your Conflict Zone. It occasionally breaks up when it comes on a fresh spawn of Hostile ships. Watch your radar for large concentrations of hostile ships, and if you spot your Friendlies heading in that direction, simply let them charge in, then go in for assist on heaviest Hostile ship and start over.
- Newer commanders should focus on Ground Conflict Zones, especially if they are veterans of other first-person shooters; this should be done via Frontline Solutions due to the ability to respawn back into battle. Low-intensity zones can yield around 500,000 credits, while high-intensity zones can yield around 5-8 million credits, depending on player skill and weapon and suit grade.
