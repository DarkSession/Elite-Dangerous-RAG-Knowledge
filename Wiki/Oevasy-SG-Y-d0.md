**Oevasy SG-Y d0**, colloquially known as **Semotus Beacon** or **Ishum's Reach**, is a system in The Abyss. It is one of the most remote discovered star systems in the Milky Way galaxy, at a distance of 65,647.34 LY from Sol and 547.52 LY from Beagle Point. Whereas Beagle Point can be reached without utilizing Engineers or FSD Injections, Oevasy SG-Y d0 is so isolated that a jump range of 82.68 LY is necessary along the route to reach it, making Engineering and FSD Injections mandatory. Only the most dedicated explorers have succeeded in traveling to the system and returning intact.

## Travelling to Oevasy SG-Y d0

Upon arriving at Beagle Point, Oevasy SG-Y d0 is only 547.52 LY away. Due to the scarcity of stars in the area, however, this relatively short span can be difficult to navigate, especially for ships with low jump ranges. A recommended route is listed below, which requires one jump of 82.68 ly, one jump of 66.32 ly, and multiple jumps ranging from 37.80 ly to 56.14 ly; in addition, every waypoint contains a star that can be fuel-scooped. Ships that are incapable of achieving at least 82.68 ly even with the use of FSD Injections cannot travel to Oevasy SG-Y d0.
