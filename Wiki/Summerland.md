**Summerland** is an Imperial system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It was the headquarters of the defunct private military corporation Darkwater Inc. Access to Summerland is restricted, and requires a permit that can only be obtained by achieving the Imperial Navy rank of Baron.

In February 3308, the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit discovered that Darkwater Inc was not only responsible for training the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army terrorist group, but it had been holding Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval captive in a hidden bunker in Summerland on behalf of a client, the Lords of Restoration. The Imperial Guard assaulted Summerland on February 9, 3308 and successfully recovered the Emperor before she could be moved to another location.^[1]^ Expecting further hostilities, Colonel Ronan Brock attempted a takeover of Summerland to fortify Darkwater Inc's position, but was unsuccessful, and the corporation was branded a criminal enterprise by the ruling Summerland Patron's Party faction. On February 17, the Empire declared Darkwater Inc a hostile military target and arranged for Summerland's permit restrictions to be lifted for three weeks to allow independent pilots to assist in the eradication campaign.^[2]^ When the Battle of Summerland concluded on February 24, the Empire established a new faction to rule the system, The Praetorian Vigil, and allowed it to take possession of Onyx Storm, Darkwater's former flagship.^[3]^
