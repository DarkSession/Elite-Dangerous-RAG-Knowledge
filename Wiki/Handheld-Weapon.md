# Handheld Weapon
- *For weapons used by commanders while in Ships, see Weapons.*

**Handheld Weapons** are used by commanders in On Foot situations. There are two main weapon types: primary and secondary. The suit determines how many of each type can be carried at once. The can inflict various damage including kinetic, laser, plasma or explosive. They are most effective in specific circumstances. They can be classified by classic archetypes such as rifles, pistols, carbine/SMG, shotguns which determine the weapon's range and handling. There are 3 manufacturers: Kinematic Armaments, Manticore, and Takada. ED: Odyssey is required.

## Weapons

### Kinetic weapons

Kinetic weapons produce kinetic damage and are highly effective against unshielded targets.

### Thermal weapons

Thermal weapons fire lasers that produce thermal damage and are highly effective against shielded targets.

### Plasma weapons

Plasma weapons produce plasma damage and are moderately effective against all targets, but plasma rounds move more slowly.

## Upgrading and Engineering

Handheld Weapons can be upgraded from Grade 1 to Grade 5 with Components, Goods, and Data. Each grade increases a weapon's DPS and adds one slot for Engineering modifications. Pioneer Supplies locations occasionally stock weapons at higher grades that may also come with at least one Engineer modification pre-installed; these high-grade weapons are one-of-a-kind and cost substantially more than normal stock.

Modifications can be installed on suits by unlocking and visiting Engineers who specialise in pilot equipment. Each modification requires a one-time payment of items and credits to install. Note that once a modification is added, it cannot be removed from the weapon or replaced. If other modifications are desired, another weapon of the same model must be purchased and upgraded to hold those mods. Since multiple weapons of the same model can be owned at once, multiple Loadouts can be created that each have weapons specialised for specific situations, such as long-range skirmishes and indoors firefights.
