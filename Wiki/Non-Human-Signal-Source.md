## Spawn Locations

Non-Human Signal Sources spawn primarily in the vicinity of the Pleiades Nebula, Witch Head Nebula, and Coalsack Nebula, three regions believed to have been claimed by the Thargoids as their territory and used as staging grounds for attacks. They also appear in the California Nebula.

Other locations include systems that have been identified by Eagle Eye as targets for imminent Thargoid attacks, systems that are experiencing Incursions, systems with Thargoid Surface Sites, and systems where significant Thargoid-related events have occurred in the past, such as Deciat.

## Threat Level

Depending on the Threat Level of a Non-Human Signal Source, one of a number of different scenarios will occur.
