# Layered Plating
> 
> 
> Layers of advanced inert lining material within the ship's plating absorb and redistribute the force from explosive attacks, reducing damage of this type at the cost of overall structural integrity.

**Layered Plating** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to modules through Engineering. It increases Explosive resistance at the cost of Hull Boost.

Even though Armour is not very resistant to Explosive damage, it is not very much of a problem. This upgrade could be used if all other resistances are very high, and there is an experimental effect upgrade available.
