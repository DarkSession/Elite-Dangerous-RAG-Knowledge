# Stories Of Life On The Frontier
Stories of Life on the Frontier
 		 	 

This book is a collection eight short stories which came free with the 1993 Frontier: Elite II game. Written by David Massey, Moira Sheehan and Kathy Dickinson, these stories are set in the Elite/Frontier Universe. Although each one can be read as a standalone story, there is an overall story-arc between each; the sub-character from one story becoming the main character in the following - perhaps for the final piece, *Full Circle,* you really need to have read the previous seven.^[1]^

There are a number of ideas introduced in *Stories Of Life On The Frontier*, with everything from slave trading to *Cold War* like espionage between the Federation and Empire. However, the main idea is really that of the adventures of Commanders; their explorations, battles, and day-to-day life out in the Elite universe.^[1]^
