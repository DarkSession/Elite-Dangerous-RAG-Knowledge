# Shadow President
Jerome Archer, current Shadow President and leader of the Republican Party
 		 	 

**Shadow President** is the title held by the leader of the opposition party in Federal Congress. When the leader of one of the Federation's two main political parties, the Liberal Party and the Republican Party, is elected President of the Federation, then the leader of the other party automatically becomes Shadow President. The title of Shadow President has no executive power attached to it, nor is it related to the position of Vice President of the Federation. The person holding the title rather scrutinises the President's actions and prepares himself or herself for possible taking over the presidency after an election.

The incumbent Shadow President is Jerome Archer.^[1]^

## Overview

Congressman Zachary Hudson of the Republican Party held the title of Shadow President during the Liberal administration of President Jasmina Halsey; when Halsey disappeared in 3301, she lost a Vote of No Confidence called by Hudson, and Hudson was then elected President by a Congressional vote.^[2]^ Congressman Felicia Winters, formerly Secretary of State under Halsey and Acting President during the initial days of her disappearance, was the de facto head of the Liberal Party at the time, and consequently became Shadow President.^[3]^^[4]^

Winters ran against Vice President Jerome Archer for the presidency in October 3309, successfully defeating her Republican rival.^[5]^ She assumed office the following year in October 3310, and in her place, Archer assumed the role of Shadow President.^[1]^

Shadow Presidents may appoint a Shadow Vice President, who serves as the opposition party's deputy leader, as well as a Shadow Cabinet.^[2]^ Edgar Santiago held the position of Shadow Vice President of the Liberal Party until his sudden retirement in late 3304. Santiago was replaced by Congressman Isolde Rochester, a longtime supporter of both former Federal President Halsey and Shadow President Winters.^[6]^
