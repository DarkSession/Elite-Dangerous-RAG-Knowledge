## Overview

The **Manticore Intimidator** is a devastatingly powerful plasma shotgun, firing a volley of high-energy plasma pellets with each pull of the trigger. Whilst it has an extremely short effective range compared to every other primary weapon, its damage output is surpassed only by the Karma L-6. Aside from its very poor range, it also holds only two shots (three if Magazine Size applied) at a time before needing to reload, and has a fairly low ammo reserve. However, its relatively fast reload offsets its low magazine capacity.

The **Intimidator** is also used by *Striker*-class NPCs in On Foot content; this makes these troops incredibly dangerous if they get too close, and will rush into close combat and do massive damage if not dispatched quickly.
