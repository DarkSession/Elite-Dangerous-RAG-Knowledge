> Tiana Fortune is an electronic-engineering genius who is rumoured to be the illegitimate child of an Imperial Guard officer. Her own military career was cut short when the circumstances surrounding her birth were revealed, resulting in her expulsion from the guard. Many in her unit demonstrated their loyalty by joining her once they'd complete their service, attracted to the comfortable living Tiana is able to offer them.
