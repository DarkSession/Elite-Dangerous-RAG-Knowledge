NGC 6820
 		 	 

**NGC 6820** is an emissions nebula with a diameter of 50 light years. It surrounds the open cluster NGC 6823 in the constellation Vulpecula. It's 6000 light years from Earth. NGC 6820 was discovered by Albert Marth (1828-1897) in 1864.

The most striking feature are the pillars of dust and gas protruding from the east side of the nebula, shaping something of a bowl inside the complex. The open cluster of NGC 6823 lies adjacent to the nebula. It is about two million years old and predominantly represented by many young blue stars, although a great patch of young protostars are also present in the area. 

Star formation is an active, ongoing process.
