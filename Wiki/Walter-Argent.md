Meredith Argent (descendant)

**Walter Argent** was a wealthy Federal industrialist from the Ayethi system in the 27th century. He was an ancestor of Meredith Argent, one of the co-founders of the Alliance.^[1]^

A power struggle in the Ayethi system between the Federal military and the Argent family during the Birthright Wars resulted in Walter Argent leaving the system with as much of the family wealth as he could take. The Argent family resettled in Alioth. Much later, the Birthright Wars were cited as a primary reason for former member systems subsequently leaving the Federation and eventually joining the Alliance.^[2]^
