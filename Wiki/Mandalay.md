> Zorgon Peterson has created a new breed of exploration vessel, designed to better handle planetary flight through the use of advanced micro thrusters to compensate for varied gravitational forces. The Mandalay offers pilots both an incredible jump range and a superior planetary exploration experience. With state-of-the-art drive stabilisers and an integrated polymer weave hull, the Mandalay’s design also allows superior management of overcharged Frame Shift Drives.

## Overview

According to Frontier, the Mandalay outperforms the Anaconda in terms of jump range.^[1]^ The ship is optimized for SCO-capable frame shift drives—however, it has a lower overall top speed in SCO than the Python Mk II and Type-8, but far better fuel economy and ease of control.^[1]^ Its maneuverability is comparable to the Diamondback Explorer.^[1]^ The Mandalay comes with a 32 t fuel tank and can equip a size 6 fuel scoop, much like other popular explorer ships such as the Asp Explorer and Krait Phantom.^[1]^

The boarding ramp is under the cockpit which makes it easier to line up the landing for exobiological scanning. The cockpit floor is transparent for a clear view of planetary terrain.

## Development

A concept artwork of this ship was first shown on X (Twitter) on 10 August 2024.^[4]^ The design is influenced by the English Electric Lightning interceptor aircraft from 1960 which has stacked engines.^[5]^ The Mandalay became available in early access with the Ascendancy update on 31 October 2024.^[2]^

## Trivia

The Mandalay is named after a species of spitting cobra native to the country of Myanmar.^[6]^
