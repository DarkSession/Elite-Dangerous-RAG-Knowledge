### Occupation

Former President of the Federation

**Loric Trander** served as the President of the Federation from 3184 to 3192.^[1]^

In 3184, Trander authorised a force of privateers in Alioth following the murder of an official named Riley Dain who had been investigating the abuse of permitted quotas in the system's gas mining sector. In response, Emperor Hesketh Duval sent the Imperial XV fleet to Alioth. The resulting conflict lasted until 3198, with neither the Federation nor the Empire achieving anything of note.^[2]^
