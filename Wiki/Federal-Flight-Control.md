**Federal Flight Control** is a Federal government agency that provides air traffic control services at ports controlled by Federal factions. As with other air traffic control services, Federal Flight Control's jurisdiction extends throughout a port's no fire zone, and it is responsible for granting or denying docking permission to ships, queuing ships to enter or exit a starport's docking bay, approving ships for automated docking guidance, and reminding pilots about the local speed limit and other protocols.
