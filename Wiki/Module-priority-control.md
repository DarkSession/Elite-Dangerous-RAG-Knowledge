# Module priority control
Once the power limit of a ship is exceeded, certain modules are disabled
 		 	 

**Module priority control** is a feature that allows pilots to prioritize power for specific modules, so that in the event of a power shortage due to an insufficient or damaged Power Plant, modules that the pilot deems vital can remain activated. It is accessible in the right panel of the HUD. Careful module priority control can allow pilots to carry more modules than their Power Plant can support and activate/deactivate them as necessary, as well as allow their ship to continue fighting to a degree even if they lose their Power Plant in combat.

## Usage

 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
By setting module priorities this Vulture is kept completely operational at a total power usage of 121%
 		 	 

To set up a hierarchy for power usage, the priority number in the Modules tab on the right-side panel can be changed for each individual module. Priority ranges from numbers "1" (highest priority) through "5" (lowest priority). For instance, a module with "5" has the lowest possible priority and will shut down first in the case of power draw excess. 

When a ship is purchased, all of its modules are set to priority "3". If a module is replaced, swapped or modified by an Engineer, that module (or its replacement) will be set to priority "1".

The idea is to set the highest number ("5") for modules which are expendable in combat. This includes Cargo Hatch, Frame Shift Drive, Fuel Scoop, and so forth.

Once module priority control is employed, the modules concerned are disabled and re-enabled automatically whenever hardpoints are deployed and retracted.

The following table lists a rather power-consuming bounty hunter loadout for the Vulture including assigned module priorities and the power usages between deployed and retracted hardpoints. Without setting module priorities, this particular loadout would render the ship entirely inoperational due to power draw excess.

## Notes

- Irrespective of module priority control, the player will still receive the mandatory cockpit warning whenever hardpoints are getting deployed that the power limit was exceeded and modules have been disabled.
