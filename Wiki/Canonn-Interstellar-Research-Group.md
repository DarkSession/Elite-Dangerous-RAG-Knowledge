## About

*The Canonn Interstellar Research Group (‘Canonn’ for short) is an independent cooperative, made up of thousands of Commanders, committed to exploration, discovery, science, biscuits and tinfoil.  The name ‘The Canonn’ was first mooted on 21st May 3301 in connection with so-called ‘anti-federation terrorist’ activities, but was soon re-appropriated for the purposes of science upon the establishment of Commander-led factions.*^[2]^

*Their base of operations is Thompson Dock, Varati – chosen by public vote – and many of their Commanders are working hard to expand our influence throughout the entire system and beyond, bringing science to the masses.*

*If there are any questions that need answering, anything strange to be investigated in the galaxy – they're usually there first.  If they're not, then they're certainly quick to respond!*

*The group is made up of pilots from all walks of life, all with different individual political allegiances.  But when they want to do science, they do it under the Canonn umbrella, because they know that they will be listened to, and taken seriously.*

Most member communication is via their Discord server, details of how to join are on their website.^[3]^

## Background

*Founded in April 3301 by the eponymous Dr Arcanonn, The Canonn is the largest and most active scientific community throughout the bubble, now operating out of Thompson Dock, Varati.*^[4]^

*It all started with the emergence of the now infamous Unknown Artefacts, a mystery that continues to dominate the universe.*

*Their never-ending mission is not just to uncover the truth about these Unknown Artefacts, but all mysteries throughout the galaxy.*

*Dr Arcanonn is helped by the Council*^[5]^ *who, in turn, only exist because of the members who tirelessly sought the unknown artefacts in those; and who now continue to find exciting science to do.*^[6]^

The Canonn is the first player group to control a Megaship: The Gnosis. The vessel was launched in Varati on May 18, 3303, and began traveling to new destinations on September 28, 3303; its current location is noted in its Flight Plan. It is equipped with all facilities except a shipyard, and is open to all CMDRs. The Gnosis is controlled by the minor faction **Canonn Gnosis Division**.^[16]^

A 10-tier community goal was launched by the Canonn Interstellar Research Group to build the ship, requesting the delivery of 35 million tons of Indium, Computer Components, and Tea. It started on 11 May 3303 and 9,721 players contributed to complete the goal in 64 hours. There was a delivery rate of 9114 tons per minute. The Gnosis will serve as a mobile command post for the Canonn and their allies. Capable of faster-than-light travel, The Gnosis will be deployed to ongoing research sites such as barnacles, ancient ruins and Thargoid sites.^[17]^^[18]^
