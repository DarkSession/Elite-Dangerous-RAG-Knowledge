## Timeline

05 FEB 3302

- Mavia Kain, leader of the Imperial Inquisition, has announced that the group's campaign to develop the planetary outpost of i Sola Prospect on Brestla A1 has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Members of the organisation were motivated to launch the campaign after becoming frustrated with i Sola Prospect's limited service options. Having received significant quantities of material, the organisation is now in a position to begin developing the outpost. A spokesperson for the group released a statement to the media: "Mavia Kain and the Imperial Inquisition would like to thank the galactic community for its support. Thanks to you, i Sola Prospect will soon be the best-equipped planetary outpost in the galaxy, rivalled only by Jameson Memorial." Improvements to the outpost are expected to begin immediately.^[1]^

28 JAN 3302 

- The Imperial Inquisition is known for regularly organising competitive combat events, ranging from small-scale skirmishes to the popular 'Hunter Games', an intense 20-person gladiatorial competition. As one might expect, members of the organisation make frequent use of outfitting services, but they are constrained by the fact that their nearest outpost offers only a limited range of options. That's why the faction has launched a campaign to develop its local outpost of i Sola Prospect on Brestla A1. Central to the initiative is a request for industrial materials, which the Imperial Inquisition will use to upgrade the outpost. A spokesperson for the group released a brief statement: "Developing i Sola Prospect will mean that every type of weapon, ship and component needed to deliver the ultimate entertainment experience is always available. Naturally this will also be a huge boon to the galactic community." If the campaign is successful, i Sola Prospect will become the first planetary outpost to boast a complete range of services, including a comprehensive shipyard.^[2]^

06 NOV 3301

- Mavia Kain, High Inquisitor of the Imperial Inquisition, has formally announced the upcoming Galactic Games for Charity. The games will take place between the 13th and 15th of November 3301 in support of the Princess Margaret Cancer Foundation. A general amnesty will be declared in the Brestla system over the weekend. The headline event is the Galactic 'Top Gun' Championship, in which pilots from across the galaxy will compete for a prize of 200 million credits. Commanders wishing to participate are invited to visit Roed Oodergaard Port in the Brestla system between 18.00 on Friday the 13th of November and 06.00 on Saturday the 14th of November. The final will be held on Sunday at 20.00. The weekend will culminate with the first ever 'Elite Hunger Games', in which 24 commanders will compete in a no-holds-barred fight to the death in Mk III Vipers.

14 AUG 3301

- Mavia Kain, the High Inquisitor and leader of the Imperial Inquisition, is scheduled to pay a visit to Admiral Varrwen Mako Brennus, leader of Emperor's Grace. The meeting will be held in the Emperor's Grace stronghold of Rishair at Lindblad Port. Both leaders will discuss a number of Imperial issues, including the assassination of Emperor Duval and the present military operations in the Pegasi sector. Rumours about the groups' cooperation have been circulating since the start of the united Imperial offensive in the Pegasi sector. Both factions are presently engaged in a peacekeeping operation against the Kumo Crew, which began when Archon Delaine illegally invaded Imperial space and took Imperial citizens into slavery. Emperor's Grace and Imperial Inquisition pilots are fighting together against this notorious crime lord, as both groups see him as a threat to galactic peace. Sources close to Admiral Brennus revealed that the factions share the same traditional Imperial values. A senior official noted that: "We both care about the Empire, the Imperial way of life, and Imperial citizens. We are natural allies. The Empire is going through tough times - we need to support each other."

## Notes

- Mavia Kain was created by the Imperial Inquisition player group to represent them during the Dangerous Games. If the Imperial Inquisition had won the competition, Kain would have been the 11th Power in Powerplay.
- Mavia Kain's portrait was also created by the Imperial Inquisition, but never appeared in *Elite Dangerous*.^[5]^
