> The Cobra Mk IV is Faulcon deLacy's development of the famous Cobra MkIII. It's a heavier and bulkier ship than the MkIII, but packs an extra punch and its better weaponry placement makes it a more effective combat vessel. It's tougher, to improve survivability, and allows better upgrading, but at the expense of some of its agility.

The **Cobra Mk IV** is small ship produced by Faulcon DeLacy. It is an upgraded variant of the classic Cobra Mk III. Whereas the Cobra Mk III was designed with an emphasis on multirole capability, the Cobra Mk IV is specialized for enhanced effectiveness in combat, exchanging overall agility for an additional weapon hardpoint and increased armour.

## Overview

The Cobra Mk IV is extremely similar in concept to the Viper Mk IV, having better armour, compartments and damage but having drastically reduced mobility. 

As a combat vessel, the Mk IV has impressive shielding and armour as well as high damage output. This lets it easily deal with other ships and it can put up a fight against even large ships. This comes at a cost as it is much slower than the Mk III: even with fully upgraded thrusters, it struggles to keep up with a Vulture. The manoeuvrability also suffers a significant drop to a rating of 3, making the Mk IV relatively sluggish in combat. With all of its hardpoints at the front, nimbler ships can take advantage of this weakness and overwhelm the Mk IV.

As a trader, the Mk IV has a relatively impressive 92t of cargo, placing it slightly behind  the Keelback and Type-6 Transporter in terms of capacity. The Cobra Mk IV also has the most internal bays of any small ship, with its maximum cargo capacity second only to its successor, the Cobra Mk V. It is therefore a viable option for traders and it can be even more useful for those looking to destroy incoming pirates, as the Mk IV can hold its own in battle.

As an explorer, the Mk IV has a lower jump range than the Mk III due to its greater mass, a consequence of its extra armour. While its variety of internal compartments can carry many of the modules typically favored by explorers, the decrease in jump range lengthens overall travel time. The Cobra Mk IV isn't a bad option for exploration, though there are several better options.

The Cobra Mk IV has one more Class 1 hardpoint than the Cobra Mk III, and adjusted hardpoint placements: two Class 2 hardpoints are located in the same positions as on the Mk III, and three Class 1 hardpoints are in a tight group on top of the ship. The interior and pilot seats are identical to the Mk III.^[1]^
