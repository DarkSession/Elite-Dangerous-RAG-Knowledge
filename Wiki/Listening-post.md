# Listening post
A listening post orbiting Synuefe XE-Y c17-7 3
 		 	 

**Listening posts** are deep-space probes with signaling technology that are manufactured by Sirius Corporation with cooperation from the Mars High Astrocartography department. In October 3302, Sirius began deploying hundreds of new listening posts across the galaxy to increase observation coverage, declaring that probes were cheaper, faster, and more reliable for conducting surveys than using human explorers.^[1]^

## Deployment

Listening posts have been in use since at least the early 3100s. The Adamastor, a megaship that was active in that era, passed by a listening post orbiting planet 3 of the Synuefe XE-Y c17-7 system on October 29, 3111 to receive the latest instructions from its owner, Azimuth Biochemicals.

On October 7, 3302, a spokesperson for the Sirius Corporation revealed that the mega-corporation had deployed hundreds of deep-space probes and signalling technologies throughout the galaxy: "Sending pilots into the void is fraught with danger. These probes can go further and faster than a human pilot, at much reduced cost and with, I daresay, more reliability. We've been working closely with the Mars High Astrocartography department on the probes' design. Human pilots are interested in sightseeing, chasing myths and 'making their mark' on the galactic stage. They get sidetracked. Our probes are immune to such distractions. At present, galactic exploration is conducted in a sporadic and improvisational way. Soon we will have far better coverage of the galaxy."^[1]^

Despite skepticism about the listening posts' purpose and even rumours that they had self-defence capabilities,^[1]^ no listening post has ever demonstrated that it is armed, and independent pilots are able to download their data freely and without negative repercussions.

## Finding listening posts

A listening post will appear in a ship's navigation panel when the ship approaches within 1,000 lightseconds of it. They can be found near primary and secondary stars, planets and moons.

While exploring a system you can perform surface scans and check the Navigation Panel for signal sources. When you found a signal source of a Listening Post you can lock on the target and drop out of supercruise. 

After targeting the listening post you can download data with your ship scanner. It will show up in the Comms Panel. The data is usually packets with the same signal identifier and an A, B, C suffix. The packets shows the systems where the other listening posts are located. You must visit all related Listening Posts to receive all the location data. 

CMDR Scott explains: ^[2]^ 

- Packet A contains the longitude co-ordinate of the signal source.
- Packet B contains the latitude co-ordinate of the signal source.
- Packet C contains the body designation of the signal source, e.g. “AB 1 c”.

"To identify the source system, each packet gives a minimum and maximum range from that Listening Post. The recommended approach is to bookmark the three systems containing Listening Posts, and use the galaxy map to select potential systems. The three systems form a triangle in space, and the source of the signal is within that triangle. Rough estimation based on the ratios of the three ranges is good enough."

"Most of the time there is only one system within the correct range of all three stars, but where multiple candidate systems exist, the body designation is sufficient to eliminate incorrect candidates. Rarely do multiple systems next to each other have a landable body with the same designation."
