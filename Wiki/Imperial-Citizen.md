# Imperial Citizen
An **Imperial Citizen** is the status of a person recognized under Imperial Law as being a legal member of the Empire. This is a social class above Imperial Slave. Their interests are represented by a Client.^[1]^ The Empire has over 1.7 trillion citizens as of 3304 CE.^[2]^

An Imperial Citizen can file a petition to their Client. A *citizen petition* is where a slave or child of a Citizen, or even a foreigner, petitions to become an Imperial Citizen. For children this is a fairly informal process, which is really a coming-of-age party with a brief ceremony at the start, which happens when they reach 21 years old.^[1]^
