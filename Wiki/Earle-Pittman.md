**Earle Pittman** is a spokesperson for Deep Space Mining, a private mining operation based out of Ring Mine in the 2MASS J03291977+3124572 system. In October 3307, after Orion Independent University contracted Deep Space Mining to help it conduct a search effort for The Scriveners Clan Dredger, Pittman served as the primary liaison to volunteering pilots. He provided a clue about the vessel's location, and dispensed rewards to those who turned in scans of it to Ring Mine.

| 1/1 | This is a message for Commander [name]. I represent Deep Space Mining. We have been contracted by Orion University to remunerate pilots for providing any data on the location of the dredger currently occupied by the Scriveners Clan. We have taken the liberty of uploading the dredger's profile to your ship's systems, you will need to scan all the uplinks to provide a match at which point we will get in touch.
<br>We have one rather shaky lead. An asteroid miner who occasionally bunks here claims to have glimpsed an unusual megaship, while returning from a long and apparently erratic journey from the Heart Nebula approximately 250 to 350 light years from here. It was thought he may have been mining at a nearby planetary ring, but we were unable to ascertain any more details.<br><br><br>Orion University will pay handsomely if you return data on the dredger to us. The standard payment is 20 million credits, with an additional payment of 250 million credits for the first ten pilots to deliver the data. Details will be provided at the time of identification.<br> |

Note that this mission will not show up on your transactions panel.<br><br><br>The first ten Commanders to deliver this data will be separately and additionally reimbursed for their efforts to the sum of 250 million credits.

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Rewards are being offered by Orion University to locate the Scriveners Clan dredger, which it claims as its legal property. The self-sustaining Dredger-class bulk cruiser was launched two centuries ago by an academic institute that was later absorbed by the university. Since then the dredger has become the home for a nomadic tribe called the Scriveners Clan, which refuses contact with all outsiders. Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew told the media: "Orion University is willing to reward pilots who can pinpoint the dredger's current location. We believe it is still within 500 light years of the Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system. Pilots who are interested in helping should first dock at Ring Mine station in the 2MASS J03291977+3124572 system, to automatically sign up to the search operation. Our associates at the starport, Deep Space Mining, will provide further information including details of the reward."^[1]^
