# Wide Angle Detailed Surface Scanner
**Wide Angle Detailed Surface Scanner** was an Engineer modification that could be applied to Detailed Surface Scanners before *Elite Dangerous: Beyond* Chapter Four (3.3), and is now no longer available. It widened the scan angle of the DSS, but increased its mass in exchange. The modification was effectively replaced by Expanded Probe Scanning Radius Scanner.

It was available in 5 grades, with the highest grade offering up to 200% wider scan angle.
