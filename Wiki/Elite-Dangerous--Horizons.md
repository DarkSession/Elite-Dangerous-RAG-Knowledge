**Elite Dangerous: Horizons** is the first paid expansion for *Elite Dangerous* and the second season of updates. The initial release was on 15 December 2015. It gradually introduced a variety of new features, gameplay and content throughout 2016 and 2017. Free improvements were provided to the base game for all Commanders while headline features were only accessible to Horizons owners. On 5 February 2016, Horizons changed from an expansion to a DLC format.^[2]^

Horizons was followed by *ED: Beyond* as the third season of updates. Beyond was available for free to all Horizons owners (see Development Plans for an overview).

On 27 October 2020, *Horizons* became a free expansion attached to the base game. All *Elite Dangerous* owners who did not purchase *Horizons* received free access to Horizons. Since then all purchases of *Elite Dangerous* include *Horizons* at no additional cost. Players who purchased *Horizons* before the conversion were given the "Azure" paint job set as an exclusive gift.^[3]^

Horizons released on the Xbox One on the 3rd of June 2016.^[4]^ Frontier intends further expansions to come out within a few days of the PC versions.

The Apple Mac platform did not receive Horizons due to the current lack of high-performance Compute Shaders in the graphics API's supported by OS X.^[5]^

PlayStation 4 support was announced on the 8th of December 2016.^[6]^ It was released on 27 June 2017.^[7]^ The PlayStation 4 version has the same content as the Xbox One and PC versions.

Note: Players on one platform cannot see players from another (except for PC/Mac). The different platforms place players in the same galaxy environment sharing a common background simulation, however direct cross-platform interaction is not possible.

### Planetary Landing - v2.0

    - *Main article: Planetary Landing*

 	 	[![Horizons-reveal-cobra-landing](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/7e/Horizons-reveal-cobra-landing.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20170220175159)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/7e/Horizons-reveal-cobra-landing.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170220175159) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Planetary Landing with a Cobra
 		 	 

Released on 15 December 2015 on PC, and on 3 June 2016 on Xbox One. Players are able to land on four types of airless planets - rocky, metal, ice and rocky/metal - which make up 61% of the planet types in Elite Dangerous' Milky Way. These planets vary in size and composition, therefore having different gravity forces affecting the flight and landing dynamics.

The landing is graphically seamless with an occasional brief pause for instance loading, and the planets can be explored in low-level flight or by using a Surface Reconnaissance Vehicle.^[8]^ Once on the surface, players can discover constructed, as well as natural, points of interest, which can be military bases, research establishments, hideouts, starports, mining complexes, crashed ships and debris to investigate. The nature of the encounter varies depending on where the player is: the planet type and composition, and the local topography affected by geology.^[9]^

Players can craft consumables using a process called synthesis, using materials looted from points of interest. SRV Fuel, Ammunition Boosters, Frame Shift Drive Boosters, and SRV Repairs can be crafted with different improvements and quality levels, based on the amount of materials used.^[10]^

- Features:
    - Planetary Landing - Ships can land on planets without atmospheres. Planet surfaces are fully explorable, and include various points of interest such as Surface Ports, Settlements, Shipwrecks, and more.
    - Surface Recon Vehicles - The Scarab SRV can be used to traverse planetary surfaces. All ships can carry one or more SRVs by equipping the Planetary Vehicle Hangar module, which allows SRVs to be deployed via a ship's Cargo Hatch.
    - Synthesis - Pilots can synthesize fuel, ammunition, module performance boosters, and other expendables using Materials. Materials have no mass and are not lost if a pilot's ship is destroyed.

### The Engineers - v2.1

 	 	[![The Engineers](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/77/The_Engineers.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20170205102212)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/77/The_Engineers.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170205102212) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
The Engineers
 		 	 

Released on 26 May 2016 on PC, and 3 June 2016 on Xbox One. Introduced the titular Engineers and improvements for the mission system and NPCs. Engineers are 30 NPCs scattered across human space in remote planetary outposts who can upgrade the weapons and modules of player ships. Accessing an Engineer, each of whom specializes in a few specific modules, requires receiving an invitation from them and completing tasks to increase player reputation. Engineers are only available to Horizons owners.

In addition, the standard mission UI has been improved, and factions at a port are now represented by specific NPCs who offer missions to players. Completing missions increase player reputation with that faction as before, but as reputation increases, players will meet higher-ranking members of that faction. Faction representative NPCs, as well as all Engineers, also have character portraits made using assets from the character creator that will be available to players in the 2.3 update. NPC ships make use of Engineer upgrades. Mission UI and NPC improvements are available to all Elite Dangerous owners.

- Features:
    - Engineers - Pilots can apply modifications to ship modules by gaining the favor of the Engineers, reclusive individuals across the galaxy with rare technical knowledge. Modifications can be crafted by exchanging quantities of Materials. Under this system, each modification is random and unique, meaning it would often take multiple "rolls" to generate a high-performance modification, and not every good roll was exactly the same. In addition, weapons had a slim chance to gain an experimental "Special Effect", a rare bonus modification with unique effects.

- Enhancements:
    - Improvements to mission board UI
    - Minor factions are now represented in the station services UI by NPCs with generated portraits. As a pilot's reputation with a minor faction increases, their contact with that faction will be replaced by other NPCs of higher rank.
    - As of 2.1, Frontier Developments have achieved development parity between the PC and Xbox One versions of the game, and all future updates and expansions will be released simultaneously on both platforms.

### The Guardians - v2.2

 	 	[![Elite Dangerous The Guardians](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/8/85/Elite_Dangerous_The_Guardians.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20170220173803)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/8/85/Elite_Dangerous_The_Guardians.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170220173803)

    - New physics for white dwarves and neutron stars: radiation plumes that can be fuel scooped to supercharge the FSD, greatly increasing its range (beyond what Synthesis can achieve) for one jump at the risk of damaging it, but this can be difficult to do as these stars will also emit hazardous levels of radiation

The Return
 		 	 

Released on 26 September 2017 for all platforms.

*The Thargoids Return!*^[12]^

Frontier said this update will be different to previous ones - content will be revealed over time rather than all being available on day one. Additional pieces of exciting content will surface over the coming months as the narrative progresses.^[13]^ The Thargoids return in an ongoing story arc with new threats in the galaxy and a community-driven narrative. Players will develop new tactics and technologies.^[12]^ It's heavily focusing on the continuation of the narrative of the Thargoids and the emerging stories surrounding them.^[14]^

After visiting the Frontier offices, Obsidian Ant reported: *"There's been some worry that 2.4 is going to be a small patch, I think that concern came from the announcement that 2.4 is going to be released in sections. From what I saw, it appeared that 2.4 is going to be at least as big as all the other patches, and it certainly isn't the end of the main development of the game."^[15]^*

## Odyssey Compatibility Updates

In order to maintain compatibility between *ED: Horizons* and *ED: Odyssey*, Frontier Developments released several "Odyssey Compatibility Updates" for *Horizons* that contain fixes and minor improvements.
