## Storyline

*"How do you win a high-stakes game when you don't even know you're being played?"*^[1]^

*Competent, driven, broken: Moira Dolan is a talented investigator who buries herself in work to hide from her past. She succeeded, until her brother, Keagan, wrecked her career. Now she works for the Proteus Collective.*^[1]^

*By night, she's tormented by the same dream. By day, she's assigned dead-end cases by Ferris - a boss who seems intent on making her fail. It appears personal, until Keagan goes missing and Ferris' actions are cast in a whole new light...^[1]^*

*Moira thinks her latest assignment will have her chasing ghosts between the stars, but instead she uncovers a deadly conspiracy threatening the precarious balance between the galaxy's major powers, one that could cost billions of lives.^[1]^*

*"If you're not predator, you're prey."*^[1]^
