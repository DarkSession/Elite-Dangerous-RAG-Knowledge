# Lightweight Armour
**Lightweight Armour** is an engineer modification that can be applied to Bulkheads. It decreases mass and improves resistances at the cost of reduced hull strength.

It is available in 5 grades, with the highest grade offering up to 55% decrease in mass.

**NOTE:** Any mass reduction/increase is not applied to the default stock Lightweight Alloys.
