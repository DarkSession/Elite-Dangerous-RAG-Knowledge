**Thermo Block** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to Shield Boosters and Shield Generators through Engineering. Depending on the module, Thermo Block has different effects. For Shield Boosters, it increases thermal resistance by 2% at the cost of 2% shield boost. For Shield Generators, it increases thermal resistance by 8% at the cost of 4% optimal strength.
