    - *Not to be confused with Conflict Zone (Signal Source).*

A **Conflict Zone** in On Foot activities refers to a battle between two minor factions for control of a settlement. Frontline Solutions allows commanders to serve as mercenaries in these battles on the side of their choice, and offers rewards for winning. Commanders can also freely enter Conflict Zones mid-battle with their personal ships and SRVs, and choose a side to support.

## Overview

When two minor factions go to war with each other, Conflict Zones appear at various settlements that the factions are contesting. The most expedient way of participating in Conflict Zones is to sign up for one at a Frontline Solutions at a local Concourse; Frontline Solutions will not offer any battles to join if no factions in the local system are in conflict; the easiest way to find Ground Conflict Zones is to search the Galaxy Map for systems that are in the War or Civil War states. Once registered, commanders are directed to board a Frontline Solutions dropship, a converted Vulture, and ride to their destination with up to five other players or NPCs. 

Commanders can also take part by approaching a surface settlement that is part of the conflict (denoted by a yellow crossed-swords icon over the settlement on the System/Planetary map) in their ship; once close enough, the choice of which faction to fight for will appear in the comms panel, similar to a space conflict zone. While landing and dismissing a ship during a battle may be somewhat dangerous, it also gives the commander a chance to change their loadout and deploy in an SRV if desired.

### Objectives

Conflict Zone battles involve two opposing teams of 12 combatants each. Combatants are deployed into a settlement from mid-air via dropship. The primary objective of each encounter is to whittle down the enemy team's reinforcement points, denoted on the HUD via a counter. The player's team is shown in green, and the enemy team is shown in red. Both teams begin with 1,000 points, and lose 5 points each time a team member is killed or, in the case of players, "critically injured".

The secondary objective is to capture and hold six control points, designated Alfa, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo, and Foxtrot, scattered across the settlement by standing within the highlighted zone surrounding each point and surviving until the meter reaches 100%. There are no more than three points active at any time. When a point is captured, the opposing team loses 50 reinforcement points, and all players on the capturing team are awarded a 3,000 Credit bond. Shortly after, a control point in another location becomes active and available for capture.

If the settlement is also unpowered, then the Energylink and possibly Arc Cutter will be needed to gain access to any buildings. All settlement consoles and other interactables like Data Ports and Turret Controls (including the Reactor Control) are locked down. Access restrictions are disabled, so doors will open for both sides if powered.

### Combatants

Aside from Commanders who may use any weapons their suit choice permits, there are five main types of NPC combatants;

- Scouts are fast-moving but somewhat fragile assault troops who use the Karma C-44 or TK Eclipse carbines for close-range combat.
- Strikers sprint into close combat and use the Manticore Intimidator. Most deadly indoors, as they can take out opponents in just one or two shots.
- Commandos make up the bulk of infantry forces, using either the Karma AR-50, TK Aphelion, or Manticore Oppressor to engage targets at all ranges.
- Sharpshooters are fragile and fight from long range using the Manticore Executioner, picking off opponents with precision fire.
- Enforcers are tough and counter SRVs and Ships using the Karma L-6, switching to the Karma P-15 or Manticore Tormentor at close range.

For Commanders, the Dominator Suit is recommended for its durability and higher capacity for weapons and consumables. There are no lootable Assets or Goods in Ground Conflict Zones, so the increased carry capacity of the Maverick Suit is of little use, though the Arc Cutter can be useful for accessing depowered buildings. The Artemis Suit and Flight Suit should be avoided given their fragility, limited supply of consumables, and limited weapon slots. As far as choice of weaponry goes, carrying at least one kinetic weapon and one laser weapon is advised.

### Redeploying

As the battle progresses, more Frontline Solutions dropships will arrive and deploy reinforcements for both sides. If the player is critically injured, they immediately redeploy aboard one of these dropships, where they can examine an overhead map of the Conflict Zone and change their Loadout if desired while they wait for the dropship to complete its descent from orbit.

### Victory

Once a team's reinforcement points have been reduced to zero and all of its members have been killed, the other team is declared the winner of the battle. They can summon a dropship to pick them up at their leisure, and once back at Frontline Solutions, they can accept their reward and redeem any bonds they earned. Note that if the battlefield was entered without using a dropship, then extraction via dropship will not be available, although a summary of the battle can still be reviewed and the commander can recall their ship in the usual on-foot manner.

## Vehicles & weapons

Conflict Zones are not compartmentalized instances. Other players can enter them on their own, and bring their ships, SRVs, and SLFs into the fray, potentially intervening for the benefit of one side or the other or simply disrupting the battle. Intruding vehicles and ships will be targeted by anti-ship turrets and Enforcer NPCs armed with Karma L-6 rocket launchers, however, making this a potentially dangerous option unless allies on the ground can disable the turrets and kill the Enforcers.

Most ship-based weapons are somewhat ineffective against ground targets, but the explosive splash damage of Missile Racks and Pack-Hound Missile Racks makes them ideal for targeting troops on the surface. Conversely, the Karma L-6 is the best choice among handheld weapons for countering ships.

## Notes

- Conflict Zones were introduced in *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*.
- *Odyssey* Update 7 added anti-ship turrets and Enforcer personnel to Conflict Zones.^[1]^
- On-Foot Conflict Zones play very similarly to Electronic Arts' *Battlefield* series of first-person shooters, as both involve capturing control points to reduce the other side's reinforcements.
