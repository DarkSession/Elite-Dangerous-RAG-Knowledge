> Core Dynamics S5LM 'guardian' skimmer – Based on their S4 skimmers but with reduced weight, and with an enhanced missile launcher weapon mount. A more expensive solution, but often used to protect higher value installations. It sacrifices armour to carry the weight of missiles and so is more vulnerable.

The **S5LM Guardian** (identified as Guardian) is a remote-control Skimmer by Core Dynamics. It is commonly used for security operations at high-security Settlements.

## Overview

It patrols a specific area. Its weaponry includes High-Explosive Seeker Missiles. The Seeker missiles detonate at close proximity rather than impact. They appear as blinking triangles on the SRV's radar, and can be individually targeted and shot down.

The S5LM Guardian is far more fragile than the S4 Sentry, but it's capable of dealing serious damage whilst engaging from its maximum range (~550 meters). The long distance makes it difficult to shoot on foot. The Guardian pop ups, lock onto a target, fires missiles and ducks behind shelter. By comparison, when the Sentry lays down suppressing fire at long range, it is less accurate and deals less damage.
