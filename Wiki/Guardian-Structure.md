Guardian Structure ruins
 		 	 

**Guardian Structures** are the ruins of highly advanced technological infrastructure built by the Guardians millions of years ago. Distinct from Ancient Ruins, Guardian Structures feature unique architecture and more active examples of Guardian technology, such as Ancient Data Terminals and Guardian Sentinels. The first Guardian Structures were discovered on February 27, 3304 thanks to the efforts of Guardian researcher Ram Tah.

Guardian Structure and a planet
 		 	 

On February 27, 3304, Ram Tah announced that he had determined three possible new Guardian sites in the Col 173 Sector QU-O d6-25, HD 63154, and Synuefe EU-Q c21-10 systems after conducting a molecular analysis of recently-retrieved Guardian objects.^[1]^ Investigation of these systems yielded the discovery of a new configuration of Guardian ruins, which held new examples of Guardian tech and were defended by Guardian Sentinels.^[2]^ Some of these sites featured devices classified as Ancient Data Terminals which contained various Guardian data files, including Guardian Module Blueprint Segments and Guardian Weapon Blueprint Segments.

Following the discovery of Guardian Beacons on August 28, 3304, the Beacons were found to contain location data for a new series of Guardian Structures with larger layouts and doubled complements of Guardian Sentinels. The Ancient Data Terminals found at these sites exclusively contained Guardian Vessel Blueprint Segments.

### Small Guardian Structures

These Guardian Structures have one of several small layouts, and are guarded by a force of up to 6 Guardian Sentinels at once. Their Ancient Data Terminals require Ancient Relics to activate, and contain either Guardian Module Blueprint Segments or Guardian Weapon Blueprint Segments. They are also used to acquire Guardian data logs for Ram Tah.

#### Active

These Small Guardian Structures may have active Ancient Data Terminals where Guardian data logs and Blueprint Segments can be acquired.

### Large Guardian Structures

These Guardian Structures are found by interacting with Guardian Beacons, which will provide exact location data when activated. They have one of several larger layouts, and are guarded by a force of up to 12 Guardian Sentinels at once. Their Ancient Data Terminals require Ancient Keys to activate, and contain only Guardian Vessel Blueprint Segments.

## Notes

- All Guardian Structures can be activated multiple times in succession, allowing multiple players to quickly scan the same structure. However, it is important to note that if the same player reactivates and scans the same structure without logging off and back in, no data will be acquired. This can be particularly frustrating with the Large Guardian Structures, as it can force the player to return to the Guardian Beacon to acquire another key.
- It is recommended to outfit your ship with Point Defense Turrets and landing it adjacent to the structure. The turrets will destroy the sentinels' missiles, making them less of an issue.
