Voyager 1
 		 	 

**Voyager 1** is an ancient human-built space probe that was used by NASA to study Jupiter, Saturn, and Titan, and then explore beyond the furthest bounds of the Sol system. It launched on September 5, 1977 with its sister probe, Voyager 2. In 3301, both probes were rediscovered approximately 2.1 million lightseconds away from Sol.^[1]^ Their current locations can be revealed using the Full Spectrum System Scanner.

Both probes include the Voyager Golden Record which is a recording of sounds and images of life on Earth. It has sounds of nearly all languages on Earth and was designed by a team led by Carl Sagan to communicate with extraterrestrial life.^[2]^

## Location

Since December 11, 3304, the Full Spectrum System Scanner has allowed both Voyager probes to be quickly and easily located without needing to use the triangulation method. The probes are treated as signal sources and can be detected when focusing the FSS Scanner on low-frequency signals on the left end of the spectrum.

## Triangulation Location Table

Prior to the implementation of the FSS Scanner, Voyager 1 was found at the locations listed below as determined by manually triangulating its distance from Sol, Sedna, and Persephone. There are two target markers which appear when within 1,000 ls of their location: "Ancient Probe" (the actual Voyager probe) and "Voyager", its associated Tourist Beacon.

## Notes

- Based on the table above, the position of Voyager 1 is growing farther from Sedna at an average rate of 4.93 ls/day (SD = 0.33 ls/day) and growing closer to Persephone at an average rate 9.56 ls/day (SD= 0.66 ls/day). This could be used to estimate the current position precisely enough to get within 1000 ls of Voyager 1.
