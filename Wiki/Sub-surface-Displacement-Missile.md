The **Sub-surface Displacement Missile** is a hardpoint module used in mining. It launches specialized missiles that can dig deep into an asteroid to reach Sub-Surface Deposits. A HUD element displays the depth of the missile inside the asteroid, allowing the pilot to manually detonate it when it reaches a Sub-surface Deposit and eject the deposit into space, where it can then be collected using a Cargo Scoop or Collector Limpet.^[1]^ A Refinery is required to process material excavated using a Sub-surface Displacement Missile.

## Specifications

> 
> 
> Displacement missiles are essentially flying drills, capable of autonomously digging through the surface of an asteroid and detonating a shaped charge when directed. This will dislodge and eject material, but also damage the deposit making it less viable with every use. The missile will fly stright until it hits an asteroid and then begin drilling down at the point of impact. Holding the trigger will delay detonation of the missile's ordnance until required. A refinery module is required to process asteroid chunks into saleable commodities. Only functions as a turret when there is an active Gunner role aboard. Only functions in analysis mode.

## Notes

- Sub-surface deposits yield significantly higher ore output when inside any Hotspot. The type of Hotspot does not need to match the type of deposit.
- The smaller the size of the deposit in the minigame, the more ore will be released. One and two-bar deposits release the most ore, with three-bar deposits releasing slightly less, and four or greater having significantly reduced output.
- Sub-surface deposits have between 2-9 chances to release a piece of ore, as shown by the integrity indicator beneath the targeted deposit. Failed attempts or misses count against this total. It is possible for a deposit to allow more chances than available deposits. Likewise, it is possible for a deposit to have more deposits than chances. For example, a 9-chance deposit will start at 100% and reduce in increments of 11%, until reaching 0% and disappearing.
- Sub-surface mining functions differently for Low Temperature Diamonds. Standard sub-surface deposits can release between approximately 2 to 6 tonnes of ore, but a Low Temperature Diamond deposit can release 8-15 tonnes. Unfortunately, Low Temperature Diamond sub-surface deposits are extremely rare.
