The **Torval family** is a prominent Imperial family that hails from Synteini. Its matriarch at the dawn of the 34th century, Senator Zemina Torval, is one of the wealthiest and most influential individuals in the Empire, having built her fortune through Imperial Slavery and her former majority stake in Mastopolos Mining, the megacorporation owned by her relatives, the Mastopolos family. In 3307, the Torval and Mastopolos families became estranged, and the cause of this rift is currently unknown.
