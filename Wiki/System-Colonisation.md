**System Colonisation** lets you claim star systems with player-led, free-form expansion in the galaxy.^[1]^ The Bubble is no longer static.^[1]^ The System Architect manages colonial development. Colonization can be done by a solo commander, group or faction.^[2]^ The beta version is currently playable, launched on 26 Feb 2025.^[3]^

## Claim

 	 	[![Colonisation Ship ED](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/8/87/Colonisation_Ship_ED.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20250117024858)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/8/87/Colonisation_Ship_ED.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20250117024858) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Colonisation ship
 		 	 

System colonization is a player-driven way to expand the Bubble and colonise new systems^[4]^ Claiming a system is first come, first served.^[5]^ The player must find an unpopulated system within 15 light years and claim it from a System Colonisation Contact.^[6]^ You can scan a star system in advance to see the number of slots that are available for construction.^[7]^ Some systems are more valuable for construction and different stellar and planetary bodies can boost or negatively impact different kinds of economies.^[7]^ Showing the System Map in Architect Mode will display the available orbital locations and the number of ground locations available on each body. One of the orbital slot icons will have a flag instead of a "+" sign: this indicates the location where the primary port will be constructed. If that primary port location isn't good, it is not recommended to spend commodities building anything other than a Military outpost. (Why Military? It provides population and security: most other structures subtract security, so it's one of the hardest system statistics to keep up.)

The player must purchase a claim with credits from a Colonisation Contact (CC).^[8]^ The CC is a member of a faction in a populated system in The Bubble, and will become the initial dominant faction in any system that is successfully colonised (allowing existing BGS factions, player minor factions and - through faction proxies - the superpowers to expand their influence).^[8]^ A Colonisation Beacon must be deployed in that system within 24 hours.^[8]^ If this is not done within the time limit then the claim is revoked.^[8]^ If you failed twice then you must wait 3 days until you can make another claim.^[9]^ The Beacon costs 25 million credits. You cannot claim multiple systems at the same time.^[9]^ A primary starport can be selected and placed in a pre-determined location.^[8]^ 

Then a Colonisation Ship (CS) arrives in the system.^[8]^ It is bigger than a Drake-Class Carrier.^[2]^  The player must deliver a list of items to the CS which depends on the starport type.^[8]^ It is a hub to work on in the system.^[2]^ Logistics is key to build a starport by transporting materials into the system.^[10]^ The starport appears in partial construction and will be finished after the weekly server tick.^[8]^ The primary port must be deployed (built) within 4 weeks. If it's not done within the time limit then all progress is lost.^[8]^ Claim will be revoked and any commodities will be lost. You'll be locked out of making another claim attempt for 3 days.^[9]^ The station under construction appears as an abandoned starport with inactive vendors and services.^[11]^

Once the primary starport is built, the colonization beacon becomes a nav beacon.^[8]^ A new Colonization Contact will appear in the completed starport; this gives the option to claim and colonize another system within 15ly by contacting the Colonization Contact.^[7]^^[8]^ There is no limit for how many systems you can be the Architect, assuming you met the initial conditions per system.^[5]^ ^[7]^ You could build basic systems and daisy chain your way towards your favorite system. You can make it your home as the main system.^[2]^

If the claimed system has planets with rings, there is a chance that Resource Extraction Sites will be created in the rings. 

## Construct

 	 	[![Space Depot ED](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/d/df/Space_Depot_ED.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20241031033518)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/d/df/Space_Depot_ED.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20241031033518) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Space Depot
 		 	 

If all commodities for the primary starport are delivered within the 4-week period, the player who claimed the system becomes the System Architect.^[8]^^[2]^ The architect has direct influence in placing existing assets, starports, planet ports, settlements and other facilities.^[10]^ There's a plethora of tools to work with. The architect has a certain number of actions to deploy construction sites and locations.^[7]^  

Before trying to place the first facility after completing primary starport, you must wait until after the weekly maintenance tick, which occurs on Thursdays at 0700 UTC. E.g., if you finished the primary port at 2100 UTC on Thursday, you'll need to wait almost a whole week before you can try placing a new facility.  If you finished the primary port at 0600 UTC on Thursday, you only need to wait an hour or two. Unfortunately, this has been complicated by the servers not being able to process all new systems during the maintenance tick, so it's possible you need to wait for a second tick before your system responds to attempts to build a new facility. 

Newly placed orbital structures will deploy a Space Depot to handle deliveries and construction, while surface surface facilities deploy a local construction site. Each facility costs commodities and materials to build, with larger facilities requiring more commodities of specific types to complete. There is no time limit for building additional facilities after the initial starport is completed. When construction is finished, the station services will be available after the weekly server tick. After selecting the site for your first facility, verify that the number of concurrent construction sites decreased: this value is found in the Architect View. If it didn't decrease, your system may not have had its first maintenance tick yet. 

For new surface facilities, after choosing the site, you must leave the instance for the construction site to appear. The construction site for a surface facility may appear immediately after leaving the instance, or it may take up to 48 hours. If it hasn't appeared after 48 hours, check the Architect View to see how many concurrent constructions you can have. If that number didn't decrease after selecting the site, it's possible your system didn't have its first tick of weekly maintenance yet. If a tick happened during the 48 hours you waited, you may want to try placing the site again. Otherwise, you'll need to wait until the tick to try placing the facility again. 

The Architect can leave the system in whatever state and return later. Once the system architect moves on, the system development stays as it is with an active BGS.^[5]^ You stay the System Architect of all your colonies forever.^[5]^ You can return to edit, add more to one of your old colonies.^[5]^ There are no colony upkeep costs^[5]^

### Facility location

 	 	[![Slot example](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/bf/Slot_example.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20250307192705)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/bf/Slot_example.png/revision/latest?cb=20250307192705) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Example of slot usage
 		 	 

Important note: As of current game version, when selecting a construction slot and after giving confirmation, there is no guarantee that the starport/facility will be constructed in the selected slot. There seem to be bug that, regardless of the slot that was selected by the player beforehand, the facility may be placed in a completely random slot. Even ignoring this bug, from testing, it seems that no matter the slot selected, there is no insurance of where the station will be placed. You did not mis-click.

Example: if you selected slot 1 for construction, but slot 0 is empty, the construction will be put in the first empty slot which is slot 0 (result from testing, see "Example of slot usage" image on the right).  **This is especially important due to reports that only a commodity market in slot 0 will be affected by economic influences from facilities at that body.**

There is currently no undo option. Every construction project, when confirmed, (except for the primary) are permanent. There is currently no way to remove/move or otherwise modify the construction project.

In the image on the right, the rightmost slot was selected, but the construction began in the leftmost slot, which was slot 0. The second construction on the right is still placed in slot 0, as vertical slot order for moons is inverted.

### Ground Ports

Do not build ground ports yet: they don't seem to be affected by economic influences. Orbital ports seem to work, however. (Surface Settlements and Surface Hubs seem to work fine: it's just the four Planetary Port surface installations that never sell more than three commodities.)

### Colony Tech Tree

A chart illustrating the upgrade paths and building requirements for colony development.
 		 	 

The tech tree image shows the beta 1 version (Feb 2025) of the building requirements for a colony.

Each construction adds or substracts the following: Population Increase, Max Population, security, tech level, wealth, standard of living, development level.

### Spreadsheets & Guides

Recommended spreadsheets: 

- The Pilot's Handbook in the Codex has tutorial information about colonization.

### Orbital Facilities

The system map shows all potential locations for a orbital facility. You can select the location and choose a facility to be deployed. Deliver goods and once that's finished the facility will be deployed.^[7]^ There are multiple tiers for orbital facilities.^[7]^ The big spaceports such as the Ocellus take a lot of effort.^[7]^ A supporting economy with small and mid-tier facilities are needed to unlock the large-tier facilities.^[7]^ The available orbital facilities are from ED: Horizons.^[7]^ Here's a list of facilities that can be built:

### Planetary facilities

You can fly around on a planet and choose a custom location to build a facility.^[7]^ Rotate and place facilities on a planet with a holographic view.^[8]^ The available slots for additional development are predetermined by the system.^[8]^ After choosing a facility there will be a ground-based construction site.^[8]^ Deliver all the goods then the planetary facility will appear.^[8]^^[7]^ The available planetary facilities are from Odyssey and Horizons.^[7]^ Some facilities give population buffs.^[7]^

### How To Get CMM Composite

If you want your system to generate CMM Composite, you'll need to set up one of the following:   

1. Rocky body **without** geological signals, biological signals, or terraforming.  (Vulcanism and rings are acceptable.) This gives a base economy of Refinery + 1.0.  Building a Surface - Planetary Port - Outpost Civilian or Surface - Planetary Port - Port will produce CMM Composite.  There's a bonus if the system's reserves level is Major or Pristine, and a penalty for Low or Depleted reserves.
2. High Metal Content body **without** geological signals, biological signals, or terraforming.  (Vulcanism and rings are acceptable.)  This gives a base economy of Extraction + 1.0.  You will need to build one of the Planetary Ports with Colony economy (Outpost Civilian or Port) and then build one or more Refineries.

Do not build Industrial, Military, or High Tech facilities on or above the body, as they can quickly consume the CMM Composite production.

If you plan to build many Military, Industrial, or High Tech facilities in the system, you may need to build a second Planetary Port on your Refinery body:  only the first Planetary Port will be penalized by the weak links from the other facilities.  The second Planetary Port will just receive the strong links from the Refineries.

### Estimate Market Production

### Government Type

### Further official information

An anarchy system has reduced security.^[7]^

According to an official announcement^[12]^ on the forum, the economy from a construction specifically affects the markets of starports on or orbiting the same body.

There are also reports that only a commodity market in orbital slot 0 will be affected by economic influences of facilities at that body.

## Factions

SC is seamlessly connected with the Background Simulation and with Powerplay.^[8]^  Colonized systems can influence the political state of the game based on the facilities and Market Economies just like the established Bubble BGS.^[10]^

During the first build in a Colonized system, the system only has the faction from which the colonisation claim was purchased;^[8]^ this allows the Commander to claim from a preferred faction so that it will be brought over to your system.^[7]^ The player will also automatically bring in their Squadron's faction, so in this way the player can control two choices of the four initial factions (see below.) If a different Background Simulation faction conquers the system later, the Colonization Architect remains in control of the system development and resources.^[8]^ The Architect stays the same forever.^[5]^ 

The factions that appear when the System is first established are:

- The controlling faction in the system where the architect placed the claim using a Contact
- The second-placed faction in that system
- The faction associated with the architect's Squadron
- A random Anarchy faction from the claiming system

The founding faction can lose influence in the system, because anyone can enter the system and participate in both BGS and Powerplay gameplay.^[7]^ 

In Powerplay, Unpopulated systems are initially unaligned; a newly colonized system will enter the "Unoccupied" Powerplay state once it is fully established.  As with any other Unoccupied system, you can then expand your Power's influence using the Acquisition mechanic. Each system has an associated value. Every system is unique to some extent which is represented in system colonisation. This can influence your system of choice.^[2]^ 

System colonization is primarily PVE (player versus environment). Players cannot blockade, attack or destroy a colonized system.^[5]^

### Ownership

The controlling minor faction owns the facilities. Some minor factions are allied with a major faction (Alliance, Empire, Federation). The Powers influence and exploit the systems, but don't actually own them. Many ships in a system are owned by a minor faction. Attacking them decreases your reputation with the minor faction. The architect places and manages the facilities in a system. The architect can technically be the owner by allying with a controlling minor faction.

## Expansion

Expanding The Bubble with colonies can have a galaxy wide effect. For example new trade routes for traders, new hubs for explorers that you can use as a home base before going into deep space.^[2]^ By having mini-Bubbles with various economies you can haul goods faster to build new colonies.^[8]^ Long-range colonization in deep space means going back to the Core Systems for goods is a long trip.^[7]^

## Naming facilities

Primary ports must be completed before they can be renamed via the system map. Facilities are named by the existing ED naming system. Without spending Arx, a facility can be renamed using the random-name generator up to 5 times.  When renaming with the random-name generator, the architect can generate unlimited random names before clicking Apply or Cancel.  The new name is only applied (and counted towards the limit of 5 renames) when the architect clicks Apply. 5000 ARX can be spent for a custom name of a facility with infinite renames.^[9]^ Commander name is displayed in the system.^[5]^

## Rewards

The Architect amasses rewards via a regular credit payment from each system under your control. This is derived from the number and scale of facilities in the star system. These payments are issues weekly and can be redeemed by visiting an Administration contact. The weekly payment value increases when you accumulate more systems. A galactic levy is placed on your earnings if you earn more than 5 million credits.^[9]^ Players also receive a small discount on ships and outfitting when purchased in a system with 10 or more facilities.^[9]^

## Trailblazer fleet

On 19 March 3311, the Brewer Corporation deployed the trailblazers fleet to strategic locations on the edge of the Core Systems. These are 'colonisation support hubs' with a bespoke trade market for colonisation materials and goods.^[13]^

Brewer COO Mark Rennik said in an interview that the first wave of independent colonisation efforts was ‘overwhelmingly popular’. “The speed at which new systems have been settled and expanded is frankly astonishing,” “and I'm delighted that so many pioneers have taken full advantage of this opportunity.”^[13]^
