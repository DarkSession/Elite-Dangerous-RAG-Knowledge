The official logo for SPVFA is featured prominently on many of the group's public projects.
 		 	 

SPVFA formerly held weekly themed contests where members compete for their image to be the group's Facebook banner for the following week. This contest ran from 3303-3309 and immortalized the work of countless CMDRs on its "Wall of Fame." In addition to the primary Facebook group, SPVFA maintains an active presence on several prominent social media services.
