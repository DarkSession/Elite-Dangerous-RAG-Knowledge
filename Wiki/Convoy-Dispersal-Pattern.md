A **Convoy Dispersal Pattern** is a type of signal source that randomly appears in populated systems. It indicates a convoy of ships has temporarily dropped into normal space, and presents a lucrative opportunity for pirates. Some convoys are better protected than others.

## Spawn Locations

Convoy Dispersal Patterns can be found in any inhabited system (usually Shipping Lanes and spheres of influence).

## Threat Level

- Threat 0: Convoy Beacons will usually contain a small group of ships in a Wing. All ships are initially neutral. They can be scanned for data and  also sometimes carry valuable cargo that can be stolen.
- Threat 1: Beacons contain a single damaged Cobra MkIII.
- Threat 2:
    - Pirates flying Anacondas and/or Pythons will attack a convoy of Type-9 Heavys. The player can choose to either side with the attacking pirates or the convoy, rewarding credits or reputation respectively.
    - A convoy of 2 Type-9 Heavys is being escorted by 4 Cobra MkIIIs and 2 Anacondas.
