## Collect

They appear very rarely around the corpse of a dead Titan. Use collector limpets or manually gather the drives with a cargo scoop open. Without a Corrosion Resistant Cargo Rack, carrying this commodity will cause damage to modules.

On 19 December 3310, pre-engineered V1 SCO FSDs became available and required 1 Titan drive component, along with other materials, to purchase.
