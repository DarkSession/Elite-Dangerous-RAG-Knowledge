Frontier: Elite II
 		 	 

**Frontier: Elite II** is a space trading and combat simulator game written by David Braben and published by GameTek in 1993. It's the long-awaited sequel to Ian Bell and David Braben's earlier game Elite, part of the Elite series and available for Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and IBM PC computers.

Frontier retains the same principal component of Elite — namely completely open-ended gameplay — and adds to this realistic physics and an accurately modeled galaxy. There is no plot within Frontier, nor are there pre-scripted missions as there are in the sequel Frontier: First Encounters. Instead players explore space while trading legally or illegally, carrying out missions for the military, ferrying passengers from system to system, engaging in piracy or any combination of the above. As a consequence, Frontier cannot be completed or "won" - instead, players themselves decide what to aspire to and set out to achieve it.

There are a number of elements introduced in *Stories Of Life On The Frontier*, with everything from dubious practices of slave trading operations, over Federal Pilot Academy, to *Cold War* like espionage between the Federation and Empire. However, the main idea is that of the adventures of Commanders; their explorations, battles, dangers and day-to-day life out in the Elite universe.^[2]^
