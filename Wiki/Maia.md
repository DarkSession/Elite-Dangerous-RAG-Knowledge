**Maia** is an Allied system in the Pleiades Nebula in the Inner Orion Spur. It is the location of Obsidian Orbital, constructed with the efforts of the galactic community and one of the first major settlements established outside the Core Systems.^[1]^^[2]^^[3]^ The system was formerly home to the Engineer and Thargoid expert Professor Ishmael Palin, who transferred his operation to the Arque system in July 3305 after a Thargoid attack on Palin Research Centre.

## History

Maia drew increased public interest as Thargoid Sensors and Thargoid Probes were discovered there and in surrounding systems. Following encounters with Thargoid vessels, journalist Kelvin Masters of the Imperial Herald said on August 25, 3303: "The barnacles seem to indicate that the Thargoids were in Maia and Merope long before we were. For all we know, humanity has expanded into what the Thargoids see as their territory."^[4]^

On July 18, 3305, the Thargoids launched a renewed offensive in the Pleiades with a focus on Maia. Palin Research Centre was attacked, and Professor Palin and his staff were stranded aboard the megaship Carson's Spring, which was attacked by Thargoids.^[5]^ On July 22, Carson's Spring was able to resume its journey and arrived in the Arque system. Professor Palin moved his staff and equipment to Abel Laboratory on Arque 4 E, and resumed offering his services there.^[6]^

## Notes

- After the Thargoid attack on Palin Research Centre on July 18, 3305 and Professor Ishmael Palin's evacuation to Arque, the facility was rendered defunct and Universal Cartographics removed its navigation marker. Palin Research Centre can still be found on Maia A 3 A (at coordinates 39.136, 171.23) and mapping the moon will mark it as "Signal Source: Other". Thargoid vessels remain present at the scene as of August 3305.
- Darnielle's Progress is currently the only market where Meta-Alloys can be purchased, but the allocation is usually capped at only 2 units.
