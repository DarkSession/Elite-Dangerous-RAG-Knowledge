**NGC 6357** is a diffuse nebula in the constellation Scorpius. It is a cluster of clusters that contains at least three clusters of young stars, including many hot, massive, luminous stars.^[1]^ Star formation with numerous filaments of dust and gas surround huge cavities of massive star clusters. It spans around 100 light years and is located 5,500 light years from Sol.^[2]^

It is also known as the Lobster Nebula.^[3]^ Scientists of the Midcourse Space Experiment named it the War and Peace Nebula. Because in infrared images the bright, western part resembles a dove, while the eastern part looks like a skull.^[4]^
