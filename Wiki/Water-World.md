Water World near Thraikai
 		 	 

A **Water World** is a type of Terrestrial Planet with a substantial amount of water on its surface or subsurface.^[1]^^[2]^ It can be completely or mostly covered in water. The liquid on the surface can consist of different fluids like lava or ammonia. 

The surface can be a layer of ice with a liquid water ocean underneath. For example Ganymede has a liquid saltwater ocean below its icy surface.^[3]^ 

Probability of life on a Water World is high, because water is essential for most life forms (flora, fauna, sentient and non-sentient). Many species evolve in or around a source of water. These are rare and thus more valuable to discover.
