A **Rocky Ice World** is a type of terrestrial planetary body. The terrain and appearance of these worlds vary greatly from system to system, but several of them have been found to contain some of the most exaggerated surface features of any landable bodies in the galaxy. Famous examples of these exaggerated worlds include Synuefe VM-D c15-10 2 A and Qeajo CZ-N c20-15 AB 1 D & E.

## Overview

Rocky Ice Worlds come in a variety of sizes and colors. Some of them have geologic activity while many are devoid of any significant persistent points of interest (POIs). Planets that have exaggerated surface features such as 30 km high mountain ranges and deep valleys sometimes display signs that they are created by pushing the limits of the stellar forge engine. Often, the silhouette of ice valleys can be seen stretching across the surface of mountain ranges. It is unknown if these worlds are indicative of a problem with the stellar forge itself or are intentional wonders programmed into the overall galactic model.
