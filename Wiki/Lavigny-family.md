# Lavigny family
The **Lavigny family** is a ranking noble family of the Empire. It owns estates on Capitol in Achenar, on Topaz in Facece,^[1]^ and in Kamadhenu,^[2]^ and is prestigious and influential enough to hold a seat in the Imperial Senate. In recent decades, the Lavignys have built a close relationship with the Imperial Family; the late Emperor Hengist Duval befriended Prince Aristide de Lavigny in his childhood, and had an affair with the Prince's wife, Florence Lavigny. Florence's daughter by Hengist, Arissa Lavigny-Duval, was crowned the 16th Emperor of the Empire following Hengist's assassination in 3301.^[3]^
