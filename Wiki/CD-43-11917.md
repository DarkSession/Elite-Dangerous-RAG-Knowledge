**CD-43 11917** is an independent system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It is the headquarters of the CQC Championship and the home of Elite-ranked or Prestiged CQC pilots. The system features Attilius Orbital, which offers 20-30% discounts on a number of weapons, modules, small and medium combat ships. Access to CD-43 11917 is permit-locked. It requires the CQC Home World Permit, which is only distributed to pilots who reach rank 50 in CQC and choose to "Prestige", which resets their rank.
