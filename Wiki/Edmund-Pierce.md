### Occupation

Project Seraph researcher at Oaken Point

Dr. **Edmund Pierce** was a scientist who was involved in Project Seraph's first phase under Professor Thomas Dorne at Oaken Point in HIP 26176. After witnessing multiple human test subjects perish in the course of experiments in adapting a Thargoid ship for human use, Pierce became disillusioned with Project Seraph and helped one test subject, Subject D-2, stowaway on Commander Hyford's ship to escape Oaken Point.

Subject D-2 was further aided by a series of beacons placed in several systems between HIP 26176 and HIP 22460. D-2 jettisoned from Commander Hyford's ship in an escape pod in HIP 26176, found a ship Pierce had prepared for her, and continued following the beacons and using them to communicate with Pierce on her way to presumed freedom. The final beacon in Synuefe GB-O c9-8 contained the permit for HIP 22460, which Pierce urged D-2 to give to the press or authorities to expose Project Seraph.

Meanwhile, Pierce's betrayal was uncovered by Project Seraph's head of security, Captain Stenson of Black Flight. Pierce was reassigned to the project's second phase site, Fort Asch in HIP 22460, where Professor Kaley Orenn had him imprisoned and then quietly executed.
