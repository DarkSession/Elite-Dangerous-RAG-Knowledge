## History

The first colony fleet arrived in 2413, setting up mining facilities, processing plants and domes to protect the workers. As time passed and the colony expanded, the volume of useful metals promoted organisations to locate some manufacturing plants on Leesti. By the end of the 2400s Leesti had become a popular source for the fruits of both the mining and manufacturing industries there.

By the 2700s the wild west feel of Leesti was beginning to recede. Corporations took over the mining interest, and with the corporations came the strict security or corporate rule. Mastopolos Mining became the main corporation operating in the system by the 3100s, as it acquired many of the smaller mining interest.

Leesti became a popular waypoint during the 3100s for novice traders to find their space legs. The moderately profitable Leesti-Diso run provided the tripartite conglomerate with more than adequate food and agricultural supplies, whilst the return journey provided Diso's populace with computers and components.^[1]^

The station George Lucas is home to the rare commodities Leestian Evil Juice and Azure Milk.

On February 3, 3308, the Sirius Corporation megaship Chariot of Rhea evacuated to Leesti after being forcibly ejected from Reorte by the Reorte Mining Coalition.^[2]^
