**Fungal Life** can be found on the surface of certain airless planets and moons, typically those orbiting O-type, B-type, and A-type stars, across the galaxy. Aside from their importance to xenobiology and other fields of science, they also bear various fungal growths that can be harvested for raw Materials without any apparent harm to the host organism.
