**Dav's Hope** is an abandoned settlement located on planet A 5 in the Hyades Sector DR-V c2-23 system. Recovered logs indicate that it was an active corporate mining site in 3286. After a series of cave-ins caused by seismic activity trapped a mining team in the mines on May 23, 3286, the unidentified corporation that ran Dav's Hope decided to cut its losses. On May 26, it ordered the site to be shut down and the mine to be deliberately collapsed with demolition charges, even though the miners inside were still alive.

Decades later, a series of listening posts picked up transmissions from Dav's Hope, leading to the settlement's discovery in early 3303. Since then, Dav's Hope has become a popular destination for independent pilots seeking to salvage Manufactured Materials left behind there.

<br>Personal data recorder:<br>Franklin James – Foreman – Mining Team 6<br><br><br>Team 6 to base, what the hell was that?! It felt like the whole planet was going to come down on top of us! Base do you read me? Base are you there?<br><br><br>Guys, pack it up, we’re heading back to base! Something’s not right here, comms are down and with that last quake, I’m calling it.<br><br><br>Follow me, we’ll head for shaft 48, there’s a wired comms station there, maybe we can find out what’s happening.<br> |

I would like to request permission to pull all mining teams out until we can secure the site.<br><br><br>Lucy Minneux: Site co-ordinator<br><br><br>Sent: 23 May 3286 15:30 UTC<br>To: Lucy Minneux: Site co-ordinator<br><br><br>Have you lost your senses? Do you know how much it will cost us to shut this place down while you “secure” the site? We’ll lose billions of credits every hour. I can’t authorise that. No, the miners keep on going, they know vhat they signed up for.<br><br><br>Nicholas Baker: Corporate Liaison<br><br><br>Sent: 23 May 3286 15:32 UTC<br>To: Nicholas Baker: Corporate Liaison<br><br><br>But sir! With this level of activity it could bring the whole installation down, not just the mine shafts, we have to evacuate, the site is no longer viable. It’s just too dangerous.<br><br><br>Lucy Minneux: Site co-ordinator<br><br><br>Sent: 23 May 3286 15:34 UTC<br>To: Lucy Minneux: Site co-ordinator<br><br><br>Who do you think you’re talking to Miss Minneux? What you need to do is do your job or we’ll have to renegotiate your contract. I trust I have made myself clear.<br><br><br>Nicholas Baker: Corporate Liaison<br> |

There’s a very high possibility that they are trapped somewhere in section 4.<br><br><br>I’m prepping the rescue team now. They should be ready to leave within the hour.<br><br><br>Lucy Minneux: Site co-ordinator<br> |

We have twenty people down here! You can’t just leave them to die like this. They have families, children. What are you going to tell them?<br><br><br>Those charges are only meant to be used at the end of the operation. We have to do something to get our people out first! We can’t just leave them buried alive down there. We have a responsibility!<br><br><br>Lucy Minneux: Site co-ordinator<br><br><br>Sent: 26 May 3286 15:35 UTC<br>To: Lucy Minneux: Site co-ordinator<br><br><br>My responsibility is to this corporation and its shareholders. There are plenty more miners to take their place, and yours for that matter. If you won’t follow orders, we’ll just find someone else that will. Now do it!<br><br><br>Nicholas Baker: Corporate Liaison<br> |
