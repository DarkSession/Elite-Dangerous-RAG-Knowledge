The **Containment Missile** is a specialized variant of the Missile Rack. It fires dumbfire missiles that force the target ship's Frame Shift Drive to reboot for an extended period. This weapon is a merit reward in Powerplay.

## Usage

To achieve the FSD inhibitory effect, each missile has a lower yield (80% damage), the rack has a lower ROF (66%) and therefore the weapon has an overall 53% DPS compared to the class 2 dumbfire missile rack. Shields do not protect against this effect, although they of course still protect against the physical damage, which is of the explosive type. A Point Defence Turret can still shoot down the missiles. 

The inhibition of the FSD is not cumulative, and can only be applied every 29 seconds. When triggered with a successful strike, the target's FSD then has to reboot for 17 seconds. After that, the target's FSD must spend a minimum of 4 seconds charging for a low-wake jump, provided it is not mass locked. This leaves a small window within which the target can escape, even if it is continually struck by Containment Missiles.^[1]^

The Containment Missile's FSD disruption effect can be replicated on standard dumbfire Missile Racks with the FSD Interrupt Experimental Effect, but the reboots caused by this are shorter in duration.
