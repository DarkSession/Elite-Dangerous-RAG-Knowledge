A molten Metal-Rich Body

> Metal rich worlds like this have a large metallic core, with plentiful metallic ores even at the surface. In places, especially around areas of past or current volcanism or liquid erosion, some higher metals can be found in their elemental form too. Mining is therefore very efficient, so these worlds are highly valued.

A **Metal-Rich Body** is a type of terrestrial planet usually found orbiting blue-white stars. The surface is often, though not always, largely covered with molten lava. It can be a young planet shortly after formation or a collision with a celestial object or have tidal forces and radiation caused by a nearby star.^[1]^ Metal-Rich Bodies with solidified surfaces are frequently landable and may support fungal lifeforms.
