### Superpowers Commit to Salvation

The leaders of the Alliance, Empire and Federation have publicly confirmed their support for Azimuth Biotech’s anti-xeno operation in HIP 22460.

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon reiterated his position during an interview with the Old Worlds Gazette:

“It is our duty to protect the peoples of the Alliance. Since we currently lack a dedicated naval fleet, we must rely on partnerships with key military providers. With Salvation’s advanced weaponry and Sirius Corporation’s large-scale logistical might, Allied worlds have never been safer from Thargoid attack.”

The Imperial Senate discussed Professor Alba Tesreau’s accusations of criminality against Azimuth Biotech, to which Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval responded:

“Professor Tesreau remains a respected member of the Achenar Research Council, but a single viewpoint cannot eclipse the strategic significance of the Proteus Wave project. Our military experts are confident that, should the weapon deliver on the promises Salvation has made, the Thargoid threat will be diminished. A review of the situation will then be conducted.”

During a promotional tour of marine training centres in the Eta Cassiopeiae system, President Zachary Hudson told reporters:

“Director Rademaker is absolutely correct: those who deliberately sabotage Azimuth Biotech’s operations are only helping the Thargoids, which is tantamount to treason. The Federation’s citizens have the right to live without fear of alien invasion, and Salvation’s ingenuity will help us preserve that right.”

One Allied megaship, three Farragut-class battle cruisers and three Majestic-class interdictors are currently deployed in the HIP 22460 system to defend the Proteus Wave against the Thargoids.

## 04 AUG

### Resources Supplied to Xeno-Retrieval Programme

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

A delivery campaign in the Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system has provided vital commodities to Azimuth Biotech.

The technical materials will enable Azimuth to analyse the salvaged wreckages of Thargoid vessels, following the activation of the Proteus Wave in the HIP 22460 system.

Captain Maxim Lagunov, commanding officer of the Glorious Prospect megaship, delivered a statement to conclude the initiative:

“Over the last week, I have been pleased to witness so many ships arriving at the Glorious Prospect in response to Director Rademaker’s request. Our cargo holds are now well stocked with HN shock mounts, micro controllers, neofabric insulation and radiation baffles. My crew are already arranging for these to be distributed to Azimuth’s xenological research centres.”

“Pilots who signed up to this campaign can now collect credit payments. We also have a limited stock of pre-engineered Guardian shard cannons, which have been ferried across from our sister ship Bright Sentinel, and these will be awarded to the most dedicated contributors.”

The Glorious Prospect will remain in the Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system alongside the Musashi, which is offering anti-xeno weaponry and redeeming Thargoid combat bonds. Two other Azimuth megaships, Bright Sentinel and Heart of Taurus, are in the nearby HIP 22460 system where the Proteus Wave project is approaching readiness.

## 05 AUG

### Azimuth Divides Media Opinion

Editorial pieces published by newsfeeds across the core systems illustrate a range of viewpoints on current events in HIP 22460.

Eye on Achenar: “There is no doubt that the real threat to our Empire will arise once the Thargoids are gone. That’s when Federal aggression will undoubtedly resume, fuelled by centuries of envy at our glorious splendour.”

Citizens' Chronicle: “Some may have mocked Princess Aisling Duval for describing Salvation as ‘a master of self-promotion and public manipulation’. But her political instincts are astute, and we believe she is right to warn us against this dangerous man.”

Sol Today: “We can all see what will happen as soon as the Thargoids have been dealt with. The Imperials will declare war against our democracy, seeking to enforce their totalitarian regime upon freedom-loving Federal citizens.”

Federal Free Press: “The government’s focus on Salvation means that vital domestic issues are being ignored. Our economy is still geared toward military spending rather than helping those families and communites who rely on state support.”

Old Worlds Gazette: “Cooperating with Sirius Corporation to harvest meta-alloys in the Coalsack Nebula was the primary cause of increased hostility from the Thargoids. Is the Alliance responsible for providing the conditions that allowed Salvation to obtain such power?”

The Tau Ceti Journal: “Senior figures in the business sector are concerned that Azimuth Biotech, despite some recent market uncertainty, has the potential to become the most influential corporation with all three superpowers. Its success in the HIP 22460 system could reshape the financial markets considerably.”

The Empirical: “Ram Tah has published theoretical papers on the Guardian technology derived from the Proteus experiments. However, he admits that full comprehension of the superweapon’s construction requires scientific data held exclusively by Salvation.”

## 08 AUG

### Azimuth Claims ‘Thargoid Doomsday’ Imminent

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Salvation’s anti-xeno superweapon is now complete and final preparations are underway in the HIP 22460 system.

Commodore Morag Halloran, Azimuth Biotech’s military coordinator, broadcast this announcement from the Bright Sentinel megaship:

“Salvation has confirmed that the Proteus Wave core mechanism is fully active. Calibration inside the Thargoid structure on the surface of HIP 22460 10b has successfully concluded. Power sources derived from Guardian designs are building to the required levels, and a final series of safety checks are currently underway.”

“Upon detonation, the energy pulse generated by the Proteus Wave will cause catastrophic disruption to all Thargoid biomechanical technology within range. Every alien vessel in HIP 22460 will immediately cease to function. Salvation predicts that the wide-ranging impact of the superweapon will drive all Thargoids out of the core systems. In practical terms, tomorrow will be their doomsday.”

“This is the culmination of years of research, coupled with Salvation’s revolutionary technology. The project could not have been realised without the military support of the Alliance, Empire and Federation. Azimuth is also grateful to those pilots who delivered vital materials and risked their lives to hold back the Thargoid fleet. Take pride in the knowledge that your courage and dedication will help bring an end to the Second Thargoid War.”

The superpowers’ anti-xeno taskforces have sent out urgent calls for emergency support to prevent Thargoid forces from attacking the Proteus Wave site in these critical final hours.

## 09 AUG

### Contact Lost after Proteus Wave Fired

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Communication with all ships in the HIP 22460 system has unexpectedly terminated, following the Proteus Wave’s activation.

As intended, the energy pulse from Salvation’s Guardian-based superweapon disabled all Thargoids in the system. This was followed by a second pulse of similar intensity from an undetermined source, which rendered the Bright Sentinel megaship powerless. The Thargoid vessels displayed signs of returning to life, after which all comms channels fell silent.

The Alliance Defence Force, Federal Navy and Imperial Navy have verified that they are no longer receiving signals from their capital ships. Azimuth Biotech has been unable to contact the Bright Sentinel or Heart of Taurus. There has been no word from Salvation or any Azimuth personnel within the system.

Some newsfeeds have begun publishing eyewitness reports from independent pilots, claiming that the Thargoids have resumed attacking all human ships. These statements have not been independently verified.

However, the superpowers are insisting on caution until the status of the Thargoid fleet can be ascertained. They have advised that non-military ships should avoid entering the HIP 22460 system until further notice.

## 10 AUG

### Thargoids Conquer HIP 22460

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The Proteus Wave’s failure has resulted in Thargoid forces overwhelming the coalition fleet in HIP 22460.

Independent and military observers have confirmed that although Salvation’s anti-xeno superweapon was activated as scheduled, it had only a temporary effect on the Thargoids. Soon afterwards, human ships in the system found themselves without power following a second unknown energy pulse and were rapidly targeted by hostile Thargoid vessels.

Vox Galactica announced that the reporter Jade Sanderlyn was able to jettison her escape pod before her drifting craft was destroyed. She delivered this summary:

“It didn’t work. The Proteus Wave didn’t work. I saw its energies ripple out from the planet, I felt it, we all did. The Thargoids reeled and went dark, but only briefly. Then something else occurred, a noise which shook our bodies, screeching through our skulls. Something alien.”

“Suddenly all systems went down: engines, comms, everything. All the flashing beams of capital ship weapons fire disappeared. Every human ship in our vicinity went dead, leaving us floating through space.”

“I watched through the canopy as the Thargoids swarmed everywhere, more than I’d ever seen before. The Bright Sentinel was their first target, and they unleashed a blazing barrage against it. Nobody on board could have survived.”

The superpowers have announced that HIP 22460 is off-limits to civilian traffic, and should now be considered Thargoid territory. The Alliance Defence Force, Federal Navy and Imperial Navy have each begun compiling official lists of every military ship deployed to the system which remains unaccounted for.

Azimuth Biotech likewise issued a statement confirming that both the Bright Sentinel and Heart of Taurus megaships have been destroyed, with all Proteus Wave project engineers missing and presumed dead. No information on the status of Salvation has yet been offered by the corporation.

## 11 AUG

### The Silent Aftermath

The Thargoid victory in the HIP 22460 system has raised many questions which neither Azimuth Biotech nor the superpowers have officially responded to.

Ernesto Rios, field correspondent for Vox Galactica, published a report summarising the latest developments:

“Two days have passed since the massacre in HIP 22460, which left many thousands dead. There have been no updates from the Alliance Defence Force or the Federal or Imperial navies. All press outlets have banned their journalists from entering the system, due to the extreme risk of Thargoid attack. We still lack specifics as to why the Proteus Wave failed. As the echoes of these horrific events fade, the authorities’ silence is deafening.”

“Azimuth Biotech’s surviving megaships, the Glorious Prospect and the Musashi, remain in the nearby Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system alongside Sirius Corporation’s vessel El Centinela Cadejo. These are accepting a steady trickle of survivors from HIP 22460, whose escape pods or ships survived long enough to regain power before the Thargoid onslaught reached them. Medical personnel have refused press access to medical bays, preventing interviews with eye-witnesses.”

“Without any formal statement from Azimuth, and with Salvation’s status still unknown, we can only speculate on what happened in HIP 22460. The Thargoids’ method of resisting the Proteus Wave’s energy pulse remains unexplained, and their subsequent dominance of the system has caused widespread unease. Rather than ending the Second Thargoid War, Salvation may have escalated it to terrifying heights.”

Heimar Borichev, deputy editor of The Sovereign, also commented on the situation:

“Obviously this is a great tragedy, and we must honour those who lost their lives. But essentially, the Thargoids have just defended themselves from the xenocide we sought to inflict upon them. Can we really justify our moral outrage at this species, for protecting themselves against our weapon of mass destruction? Could all of this have been avoided?”

## 12 AUG

### Fleets Withdraw from Thargoid-Controlled System

The Alliance, Empire and Federation have confirmed that the remains of their anti-xeno taskforces have fully retreated from the HIP 22460 system.

Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori declared: “The Thargoids are now heavily entrenched in HIP 22460. Federal search and rescue teams are attempting to locate survivors, but our window of opportunity is closing as the enemy forces increase in number.”

A similar statement came from Senator Denton Patreus, who admitted “The aliens have successfully established a stronghold within human-occupied space.” The Imperial Navy has been instructed to prioritise evacuating its own ships and crew.

The Alliance Assembly and the Council of Admirals have been engaged in emergency discussions with representatives from Sirius Corporation. Early indications suggest a restructuring of anti-xeno operations is underway.

Across the core systems, public fears of a mass Thargoid invasion are running high. Planetary security forces are on alert, with every spacegoing military preparing for the possibility of fighting Thargoid vessels. Many public figures have expressed their concerns, including Aegis’s former head of research Professor Alba Tesreau:

“I am utterly horrified by events in HIP 22460. Many of us feared that Azimuth’s experiments would lead to catastrophe, but the widespread loss of life is still a sickening shock. Salvation critically underestimated the Thargoids’ ability to adapt, a failure rooted in his perception of them as purely reactive creatures.”

“This tragedy is worsened by the fractured responses of the superpowers, which are reluctant to continue sharing information with external organisations. Without a dedicated research effort, we cannot analyse the Thargoid technology used in HIP 22460 or formulate a suitable defence.”

## 15 AUG

### Rumours Arise of New Alien Artefacts

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Anecdotal reports suggest that a previously unknown non-human object has been discovered by independent pilots.

No details about where or how the object was obtained have been established at this time. What little information exists has been provided by individual members of the Pilots’ Federation.

One of these sources is a public message posted by Commander Marcus Mercer via an Interstellar Common Experience (ICE) network:

“I recently met up with an old friend of mine. Let’s call her Digger. Years ago we’d team up to excavate Guardian and Thargoid artefacts. Sold them and split the profits. She mentioned having an ‘unusual find’ in her ship’s cargo hold, and invited me onboard to check it out.”

“Standing there bathed in its light from the other side of the window, I knew this was something alien. But it wasn’t just another dusty relic from millennia ago. This looked newer, alive and glowing, giving off a vibration that made me feel queasy.”

“Commander Kralone was the first to discover these objects, apparently. Digger said she’d worked out how to get hold of one and would tell me how – for a price. I joked that if Aegis was still around, it would have paid big credits for the thing. Digger suddenly stopped talking and gave me this look. Then she kicked me off her ship and was out of the docking bay before I’d even cleared the hangar!”

“I know that Digger spends a lot of her time investigating Thargoid stuff planet-side. So I’m going to visit a few and see what turns up. There’s got to be more of those things out there, and if they end up being worth something, then I want my share.”

### Alliance-Sirius Pact Accelerated

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Sirius Corporation CEO Li Yong-Rui have issued a joint statement regarding territorial defence against the Thargoids.

“The recent tragedy in HIP 22460 has underscored the crucial importance of the strategic defence pact. As the likelihood of increased Thargoid aggression rises, Allied systems can be assured that we are making rapid changes to withstand this potential threat.”

“Admiral Nikolas Glass will now coordinate all anti-xeno military operations. His first priority is to update the existing infrastructure of the Alliance Defence Force, allowing member system fleets to form according to mission parameters. This will bring greater flexibility and allow the ADF to direct forces to anywhere Thargoid incursions occur.”

“Allied worlds are calling out for greater defences, and the absence of a dedicated Alliance Navy has never been felt so keenly. But the Assembly is willing to approve greater military spending, and Sirius Corporation stands ready to put the defence pact into practice.”

In related news, the Council of Admirals officially verified that the Oath of Tyndareus was lost with all hands during the Thargoid counter-attack in the HIP 22460 system. The megaship’s crew have been posthumously honoured in a public ceremony.

## 16 AUG

### Far God Cult Praises Alien Victory

A breakaway sect of the Thargoid-worshipping fringe religion is apparently celebrating the massacre of human forces in the HIP 22460 system.

A message was broadcast from the Testament megaship by the anonymous woman known only as the First Apostle of the True Chapters:

“We rejoice in the Far God’s triumph! Those who tried to desecrate the dark angels have paid the price. The Far God is calling to us from the higher dimensions, and Its manifestation is closer than ever before. It is coming.”

There has been widespread outrage at Far God believers for their joyous reaction to the many thousands of deaths in HIP 22460. Some political and military leaders have even called for the ‘alien-loving traitors’ to be arrested as enemy agents. However, there is no evidence that they have any actual relationship with the Thargoid species other than idolisation.

Dr Jameelah Griffin of the Galactic Interfaith Commune commented:

“Despite its unusual belief system, and notwithstanding the poor taste of the First Apostle’s remarks, we should support the evolution of the Far God cult toward a more structured framework. We must also remember that it is a lawful institution, and only establishes hive-chapels in systems with legislation that protects religious liberty.”

Authorities in several of those systems have stated that local Far God chapters are experiencing a surge in recruitment. Anecdotal reports suggest that these newest members are convinced the Second Thargoid War is already lost, and that humanity’s extinction is as inevitable as the cult has always claimed.

## 17 AUG

### Mysteries of the Thargoids

Professor Ishmael Palin, the foremost authority on the Thargoids, has authored a short article for the scientific journal The Empirical.

“Recent events have once again brought a focus on the alien species we call Thargoids. I have witnessed governments, militaries and public figures characterise them as a mindless destructive force, akin to a swarm of locusts. I feel it is important to underscore how much is absent from our understanding.”

“Despite many decades of research, the Thargoid civilisation remains totally alien. We still have almost no true understanding of their language, society, culture or objectives. Non-violent interactions with their spacecraft in recent years have provided little insight, other than their commitment to patrolling and harvesting meta-alloy sources. Of course, their willingness to fight is one of the few traits we definitely share.”

“As yet we have almost no knowledge of their hierarchy, beyond broad assumptions that they follow the functional roles of known insect species. Due to the biomechanical nature of their constructs, we are even uncertain about the dividing line between individual beings and their vessels. If living Thargoids have ever been studied, as is rumoured, then it is by clandestine means, concealed from the scientific community.”

“While Thargoids frequently drag ships out of hyperspace to be scanned, not all of these incidents result in an attack. Their hostile reaction to Guardian artefacts may be something like a genetic memory, hard-coded into their technologies. Even the Thargoids’ perception of time could be very different to ours. What we think of as an ancient war might be recent or ongoing from their viewpoint.”

“However, in HIP 22460 we witnessed something new: an active countermeasure to the Proteus Wave. This suggests that their perception of humanity has changed. We are no longer troublesome scavengers claiming the scraps left behind by higher life forms. Instead, we have sought to decimate their numbers again, just as with the Mycoid virus centuries ago. I believe we now have the Thargoids’ full attention.”

“Our future relationship with the Thargoids is uncertain. But I’m keen to offer the reminder that we are dealing with a species of enormous intelligence and complexity, not a horde of voracious animals. We must strive to learn more about them, and hope they have the capacity to view us as something other than an enemy.”

## 19 AUG

### Palin and Ram Tah Seek Unclassified Relics

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Two engineers who specialise in studying alien technology have requested deliveries of a newly discovered artefact.

Professor Ishmael Palin explained the details:

“These ‘unclassified relics’ – as they are currently known – are Guardian in origin. Traditionally such artefacts trigger a hostile reaction from any Thargoid technology introduced to it. But our preliminary studies show a molecular realignment of the artefact’s crystalline structure, resulting in something that emits both Guardian and Thargoid energy signatures.”

“This came to my attention only recently, unusual electromagnetic fields appeared on my sensors as CMDR Hurix approached Abel Laboratory while carrying one of these objects. I am now offering reimbursement to any pilots who can provide more relics for further study.”

Ram Tah provided a similar statement:

“This is an exciting development in the field of xenological research. For the very first time, Guardian and Thargoid systems have interacted to synthesise a new material. Initial data suggests this is now a consistent process whenever a Guardian relic interfaces with a Thargoid surface site. The first relic I saw was gratefully received from CMDR Demlagor’s team several days ago.”

“What is their purpose? Have we accidentally unlocked some transformative function that was always present? Or have the Thargoids reconsidered their technological adaptation in response to recent events in the HIP 22460 system? With the help of contributing pilots, my shared research project with Professor Palin may furnish us with answers.”

Unclassified relics can be delivered to Professor Palin at Abel Laboratory in the Arque system, or to Ram Tah at Phoenix Base in the Meene system.

## 22 AUG

### A Day of Remembrance for HIP 22460

President Zachary Hudson has announced that today is a Federal day of remembrance for those lost in HIP 22460 on August 9th.

In a public address, the president formally acknowledged the recent tragedy:

“The Battle of HIP 22460 is a dark day in our interstellar nation’s history. The crews of the FNS Bombardier, FNS Fortitude and FNS Varian Scott gave their lives with dignity and honour, as did many other courageous individuals. They will never be forgotten for as long as the Federation endures.”

“We recognise this massacre of defenceless crew for what it was: the latest example of unrelenting hostility by our Thargoid enemy. Another event which leads me to believe no peace can be brokered with that species. I promise, under no uncertain terms, that the loss of over fifty thousand naval personnel will be avenged.”

Shadow President Felicia Winters provided a statement to The Federal Times:

“I wholeheartedly support the creation of this day of remembrance. But we are not entirely blameless in causing the disaster. If not for an ill-considered commitment of Federal Navy resources to Salvation’s banner, this misguided project might never have been realised.”

“I might add that President Hudson fails to explain precisely how we will enact revenge upon the Thargoids. Now that we appear to lack further superweapon technology, our conventional forces will be severely challenged if the conflict escalates.”

## 23 AUG

### ‘Thargoid Roar’ Claim Draws Speculation

An independent journalist has suggested that some survivors of the Battle of HIP 22460 heard a strange alien sound of unknown origin.

Flint ‘Firemaker’ Lafosse published his theories via the Rewired network:

“Only a handful of crewmembers rescued from HIP 22460 managed to give garbled first-hand accounts before being placed under military quarantine. Naturally, most talked about how those damn bugs wiped out almost everyone. But a few mentioned something bizarre heard shortly after the Thargoid counter-attack.”

“These witnesses described it in various ways: ‘ghastly’, ‘overwhelming’, ‘monstrous’ to name a few. Jade Sanderlyn, Vox Galactica’s hotshot reporter, said it was ‘a noise which shook our bodies, screeching through our skulls’. Now, there are no audio recordings in the public domain to share, but there’s definitely a pattern if you study the reports closely.”

“Both ship and suit audio systems interpret all sorts of electromagnetic emissions from Thargoid vessels. This would have to be a far more powerful cry to cut through the chaos across multiple ships. Could it have been a roar of defiance, aimed at us? Or was it aimed somewhere else?”

“And before anyone accuses me of stirring up trouble like usual: no, I haven’t technically heard the alleged sound myself. Full disclosure. But someone has to speak up for those who insist it happened. I wasn’t in HIP 22460 and neither were most of you. Got it?”

“Here’s where it gets interesting, though. The Federal Navy responded to my request for details by stating all HIP 22460 data was classified. The Imperial Navy refused to acknowledge me at all. The Alliance Defence Force said it was ‘likely a symptom of collective trauma or hysteria’. So the obvious question is: what are they all hiding?”

“Congressional hopeful Dalton Chase, governor of Andavandul 1, is one of the few people in a position of stellar authority talking openly about HIP 22460. Chase recently argued that people have a right to know everything that happened. Other broadcasters like Heimar Borichev, Kit Fowler and Joy Senne are also not accepting the silence. We’ll continue demanding answers from those who are supposedly protecting us.”

## 25 AUG

### Report from HIP 22460: ‘Salvation is Dead’

It has been confirmed that Salvation, figurehead of Azimuth Biotech and creator of the Proteus Wave, was killed on board the Bright Sentinel.

A segment of a transmission by an independent rescue team within HIP 22460 was shared with Vox Galactica by an anonymous source. The team was reporting back to the Musashi megaship, which has now returned to the T Tauri system.

“Captain Qadir, this is Drummond. You’re not paying us well enough to be in this hellhole. There are Thargoids everywhere we turn. But we’ve found out what you wanted to know. It’s not good news.”

“We finally managed to get close to the wreck of the Bright Sentinel, near where the bridge used to be. Bodies were drifting among the twisted metal, but fewer than we expected. We identified some of the command crew, including Commodore Halloran. But even before we got a positive ID scan, I recognised Dr Wycherley immediately. Nobody else could possibly look so old.”

“He was still in his command chair, surrounded by shattered fragments of cybernetic implants, his portable medical sensors dormant. Despite his shredded and broken body, his eyes were frozen open. I reached out to close them, but a Thargoid interceptor suddenly warped in and we had to race back to our ship.”

“I’m uploading all our data now, but I’m sorry to report that our primary target was not recoverable. Salvation is dead.”

Azimuth Biotech has confirmed that it employed freelance specialists to locate any surviving personnel from the Proteus Wave project, and that their findings were believed to be accurate. No further statement has yet been made.

### Megaship Materials Boost Alliance Defence Force

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Sirius Corporation has gathered resources in the Leesti system to help improve the Alliance’s anti-xeno defences.

The campaign’s conclusion was announced by Captain Delfina Dominguez, commanding officer of the Chariot of Rhea megaship:

“Many pilots docked with us over the past week to deliver shipments of energy grid assemblies, magnetic emitter coils, power transfer buses and titanium. On behalf of Sirius Corporation and the Allied Defence Force, I thank you for such encouraging support.”

“I am informed that these will be sufficient to outfit 2 sentry megaships, each armed with experimental AX weaponry. These will be placed in key systems across the Alliance, ready to respond to potential Thargoid incursions.”

“Admiral Glass has outlined his long-term plans to senior officers in the Sirius Navy. It’s clear that these are exciting times for the Alliance Defence Force. If the Thargoids come, we will be better prepared to repel them.”

The Council of Admirals has stated that the new megaships are expected to become operational by September 15th.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect payment from the Chariot of Rhea in the Leesti system.

## 26 AUG

### Retrial Requested for Admiral Tanner

The Federal Attorney’s Office has called for the conviction of former admiral Aden Tanner to be reviewed in light of events in HIP 22460.

Following a distinguished career in the Federal Navy, Tanner served as the chief military liaison for Aegis. In November 3307, while in command of the Aegis Defense megaship Musashi, he attempted to take control of Hind Mine starport. He believed it held evidence that Salvation intentionally attracted the Thargoids to the Cornsar system in order to test his superweapon.

Tanner’s attack failed and the Musashi was overtaken, largely due to superior numbers of independent pilots supporting the former Taurus Mining Ventures, now Azimuth Biotech. He was court martialled, dishonourably discharged, and found guilty of mutiny and unlawful military action. But his sentencing was postponed by request of Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori, who considered Tanner’s intel to be crucial to his own investigation into Salvation.

The Federal Times published this statement from Senior Attorney Fiona Logan:

“It is now a proven fact that the Guardian-based nature of the Proteus Wave was intended to attract the Thargoid fleet to HIP 22460. Component analysis by Ram Tah has verified that its forerunner superweapons were almost certainly designed to do likewise.”

“This substantiates Tanner’s allegation that Salvation deliberately invited Thargoid incursions in inhabited systems. Furthermore, Salvation originally claimed that his anti-xeno detection network alerted him to the aliens’ approach, but there is no evidence that this network exists.”

The Federal Navy Criminal Court confirmed that a formal application for a judiciary review was received. A special panel has been convened to reassess Tanner’s case.

## 27 AUG

### Fears Rise of Thargoid Expansion

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Ships travelling in the vicinity of HIP 22460 have reported so-called ‘hyperdiction’ incidents at increased distances from the Thargoid-controlled system.

Pilots have filed similar reports about encounters in V0402 Aurigae, HR 1490, Synuefe SA-C b33-2 and several other systems. The number of ships being pulled from hyperspace and scanned by Thargoid vessels – or in some cases attacked immediately - has substantially increased.

Admiral Maxton Price issued a statement on behalf of the Federal Navy:

“Our initial analysis suggested that, having eliminated the Proteus Wave, the Thargoids would extend their forces out from the HIP 22460 system. Unfortunately, those predictions have proved correct. New data indicates that they are using that system as a base of operations to expand into the sector.”

“Historically, hyperdiction events did not always result in conflict. But the recent spate of direct attacks proves that the Thargoids’ aggression toward humanity has reached new levels. All civilian traffic should exercise extreme caution while travelling within the Pleiades region.”

Professor Alba Tesreau published an alternative viewpoint:

“What we interpret as a military expansion may instead be an attempt to reclaim territory. The Pleiades Nebula has long had a considerable Thargoid presence, with many planets containing barnacle sites where their vessels harvest meta-alloys. It seems logical that they would use their increased numbers in HIP 22460 to reassert their claim on the region.”

## 30 AUG

### A New Chapter for Azimuth

Azimuth Biotech has outlined plans for the corporation’s future following the confirmation of Salvation’s death.

Director Torben Rademaker, head of strategic operations, submitted a statement to public newsfeeds:

“The loss of Salvation, formerly known as Caleb Wycherley, is a sad day for our organisation. We will remember his sacrifice on humanity’s behalf, but recognise this as a chance to forge a fresh path towards the future.”

“Azimuth Biotech is now under new management, with myself as its acting CEO. We have lost a great deal of expertise and personnel, but our decades of xenological research will serve a vital purpose in the war against the Thargoids.”

“Unfortunately, due to a misguided campaign by radicalised saboteurs, many of our official facilities have been illegally snatched from our control. Yet plans are already underway to rebuild our corporate infrastructure. Of our surviving megaships, the Musashi has returned to our headquarters in the T Tauri system, while the Glorious Prospect has jumped to the LHS 157 system to establish a resource-gathering initiative.”

“I can assure our former clients in the Alliance, Empire and Federation that Azimuth Biotech is beginning a new chapter in its long and successful history.”
