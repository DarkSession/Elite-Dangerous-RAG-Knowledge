## Guide

The player should be familiar with all ships that they might be fighting before engaging any targets. You should also be very careful as sometimes your target does not fly alone. It's likely that they will attack you without asking.

## Rank difficulty

Expected ship per rank. Enemy ships become more engineered as you progress.

| Rank | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Elite | Corvette or Anaconda |
| Deadly | Python |
| Dangerous | Fer-de-Lance |
| Master | Federal Assault Ship |
| Expert | Vulture |
| Competent | Cobra III and IV |

## Guide

Take the low ranking assassination missions if you can’t handle Deadly ranked ships yet. Recommended is to stack massacre missions too, because it’s 100% free money if you’re doing the assassinations. There’s no point in only doing the assassination missions. You could made half a billion credits in 1 day. Just scale it down if you want to make moderate money instead.

Don’t just take assassinations. Take massacre missions and assassinations. Approximately 7-10 massacre missions and the rest assassinations. The assassinations count towards the massacre count, so it’s free money even if you’re just doing assassinations (but you want to do a few low ranking massacres too). If you do not have an engineered combat ship, then deliberately take low ranking assassinations, and deliberately stack 50% high ranking massacres (ex: kill 20-30 pirates for 20-40 million credits) and 50% low ranking massacres (ex: kill 5-10 pirates for 5-10 million credits) from different factions that all target the same pirate faction in the same star system.^[1]^

Never take team missions if you are flying solo or you will get killed and waste time. The pay is worse by comparison.

3. Go to the target system. Don’t go to HasRez sites. Instead scan the Nav Beacon, then deliberately go to the low ranking mission signal sources first, travel outward from the star by distance. You often get interdicted by your assassination targets. Submit and kill them, because it makes your job easier.

It causes you to kill the low level, novice pirates first. Due to the missions stack, 1 kill counts across all missions, including the Elite ranked 20-40 mil missions. So you get paid for killing elite ships when you only killed mostly harmless or novice ships. You breeze through 30 pirates in no time, then head back to the source system(s), turn everything in and restack. This will make you lots of money. Using a fully engineered Corvette, you could take the Elite ranked **assassination** missions too. The reward is a reliable 200 million credits per hour on the low end. For example 290 million credits by stacking four 40 mil massacres, a handful of 10-20 mil massacres, and the rest are assassinations + about 20 mil for the bounties for killing them all. The warrant scanner is not important. It's not worth the hassle when you are making bank like this.

The Elite missions are almost always Federal Corvettes and Anacondas. The ships become progressively more engineered as you go up the ranks. 

The key to optimizing is really finding a system with that tool, because then al missions just source to the same target system. Otherwise you have to sift through, and it takes an hour to stack when it could take 20 minutes.

Once you feel comfortable taking out the targets if you manage to get multiple in the same system they will sometimes spawn together and initially at least not attack you. In fact often they attack each other, which is helpful. It also saves having to travel to some other location to nail both.

The Elite targets often run once the fight turns in your favour. So be prepared to target their FSD when you get their shields down. They do often manage to low wake. A wake scanner will allow you to follow them and they will still be in the damaged state when they low waked. If you do not scan their wake you will find they are back to 100% when you find them next.

## Equipment

It's recommended to use an FSD Wake Scanner and FSD Interdictor to track down and engage targets. Kill Warrant Scanners are also quite useful.
