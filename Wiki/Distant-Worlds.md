**Distant Worlds**, more popularly known as Distant Worlds Expedition (DWE), and retroactively as Distant Worlds 3302^[1]^ was the first major community expedition in Elite: Dangerous history. Created by CMDR Erimus Kamzel as the sequel to his Distant Suns journey, and organised by Erimus, Dr. Kaii, Kancro Vantas, Wishblend, Akira Makasari, Katejina, Corbin Moran and many other volunteers, it was launched on 14th January 3302. It featured over a thousand recorded members with many more who followed along the journey. Its legacy continues to inspire the community through the variety of expeditions that sprung up after it, and its effects on in-game events such as Jaques Station's community goal, "Jaques' Big Jump", and the colonization of Colonia.

## Background

 	  	 	 			   	 	 		 			 		 		 			
Distant Worlds- A journey beyond the Abyss (Elite- Dangerous)
 		 		 	 

On December 16th 3300, the day Elite Dangerous was officially released, a long ranged Asp Explorer, the DSS Beagle, piloted by CMDR 'Erimus' Kamzel, left the Pallaeni star system to begin the first recorded galactic crossing.

Some 5 weeks later, on January 18th 3301, DSS Beagle reached a star system on the edge of the far galactic rim, 65,279 LYs from Sol. The system (CEECKIA ZQ-L C24-0) subsequently became known as 'Beagle Point'. It marked the end of the line of the Distant Suns expedition.

One year later, in January 3302, the DSS Beagle was recommissioned and given a new mission.

Codenamed 'Distant Worlds', this new expedition tasked all its participants to travel a route that roughly followed the original path taken by the Beagle back in 3301, this time with the added task of surveying and exploring as many worlds as possible at key locations along the way.

## About

Distant Worlds Expedition (DWE) was the first major community expedition in Elite: Dangerous.

It was organized by a great number of people; CMDR Erimus Kamzel, Dr. Kaii, Glasswalker, NeoTron, grnbrg, Kancro Vantas, Corbin Moran and the FGE, Wishblend, Wolverine, Katejina, Akira Makasari, Jhyrryl, Kola2, The\_Damn\_Fox, Rodent54, Nexolek, Dommarraa, and Eoran.

Numerous logistics departments were needed to support the expedition, ranging from dedicated scouts, prospector carriers, and even a security department.

The Expedition went through 23 waypoints, from the "bubble" (inhabited space), across the galaxy to Beagle Point, one of the furthest known star system from Sol. Waypoints were grouped together in stages.

| Stage | Waypoints |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Waypoints 1 - 5 |
| 2 | Waypoints 6-8 |
| 3 | Waypoints 9-17 |
| 4 | Waypoints 18-20 |
| 5 | Waypoints 21-23 |

Waypoints tended to be set within or around large nebulae. Each waypoint includes planetary coordinates where a base camp is formed, each with their own designation. Once the expedition had reached Beagle Point, CMDRs were free to return home in any manner they chose. Commanders who did not own *Elite Dangerous: Horizons* would rendezvous in orbit with each other.

### Main fleet and slow boat

Members were self-separated into two fleets based on their ability to keep up with the waypoint schedule of distant worlds. The slow-boat fleet traveled 2 weeks behind the main fleet.

## Pre-launch

### Registration

Registration for the expedition required that members make a comment on the official forums.

During Registration, members could choose to take on specific expedition roles created by the Distant Worlds organisers:

- Fuel Rat
    - Cargo Rack and a Fuel Transfer Limpet to your ship, and take a stock of limpets in your cargo hold.
- Prospector
    - This role is geared toward helping out fellow fleet members as your role involves pinpointing resource-rich worlds.
    - After locating an outcrop or meteorite that contains minerals - find out what it yields by blasting it with your SRV laser. Make a note of what you find and relay it to fleet members in the Skype Text Prospectors Channel, stating what kind of minerals you have discovered. If someone who needs them is nearby, you may be required to remain on site to keep the instance open until their SRV crew arrives to collect the minerals.
    - Worlds of particular interest are ones that have deposits of the minerals that enable FSD Boosting (see the logistics section below for further details on 'Jumponium' synthesis)
- Cartographer
    - These roles require pilots who have the most game time to spare.
    - Your role is to seek out interesting worlds with interesting surface features for the fleet to explore.
    - Try to stay within a 300 LY radius of each designated waypoint POI though as we don't have time to deviate too far off the planned route.
    - This role will require you to stay no more than a day or two ahead of the main fleet as to give you sufficient time in reporting interesting finds close to the base camp system.
- Armed Escort
    - For close encounters of the unknown kind.
- Cargo Haulage
    - It is said that our first encounter with the Thargoids will determine our relationship with them. If we are hostile, expect to die. If there are Thargoid outposts out there that we somehow stumble upon, and they allow us to dock, having trade goods may be a good idea. Just don't take bug spray, they may get the wrong idea!
- Video Makers, Photographers, and Live Streamers
    - Feel free to make videos or run live streams for any part of the expedition... the more the merrier!

### Private groups

Kamzel, Patrecleus, Erimus; also known as Group K, P and E are the three private groups used for the expedition by members.

The first 600 members who signed up for the expedition were added to Group K. The second 400 members were added to Group P. the outliers were added to Group E. After Waypoint 11, Group P members were merged into Group K. After [insert WP here], all groups were merged into Group E.

### Console-registered members

### Commander profiles

Since there were no CMDR avatars yet, CMDR Katejina started offering to create ship profile images for members on the expedition on request. They contained their ship, an Icon representing their CMDR, and the ship's name.

### DW logo contest

The DW logo contest was organised by CMDR Kola2.^[2]^ The submissions were posted on the forum thread until 13th January 3302 where voting was opened. The winner was announced on the Distant Worlds Expedition Twitch stream the next day on the 14th. The launch day of the expedition. The winning submission was created by CMDR Hi-Ban.

Beagle Point - Arrival Day (Distant Worlds 3302)
 		 		 	 
The main fleet arrived at beagle point on the 2nd April 3302.

571 commanders of the 1,153 registered confirmed that they had reached Beagle Point. ^[5]^
2nd April to 10th April marked the start of the Beagle Point Week.

 	  	 	 			   	 	 		 			 		 		 			
Distant Worlds- Closing Ceremony Formation Flight -Elite Dangerous Horizons 2.1 Engineers-
 		 		 	 

On 5th June 3302, the FGE fleet arrived. The closing ceremony was staged with formation flying, including the missing man formation to honour the fallen who never made it to Beagle Point.

## WP 24 - Reunion

Waypoint 24 was an added waypoint to reunite members of the expedition on its anniversay. It was hosted on the moon, Mitterand Hollow in Epsilon Indi.

## Notable CMDRS and organizations

### **The Distant Worlds Centralized Photo Gallery Team**

CMDR Qohen Leth, CMDR Galaxyutii, CMDR PaleoGamer, CMDR HeyPinkiePie, CMDR Alistair Hope, CMDR Jerek, CMDR Timotheus Sr., CMDR Txakal, CMDR TK-421994, CMDR Cold Tallinn, CMDR May, CMDR atomicb0mb, CMDR Leonardo White

### **Prospecting & Cartography**

Prior to Horizons 2.1, Scanning a planet did not provide information on what materials can be found on a planet. Prospecting & Cartography was formed to prospect waypoint and surrounding systems for jumponium materials. Systems with level 1 jumponium materials are considered "Green systems".

Members of Prospecting & Cartography include but are not limited to Akira Makasari, Nexolek, Jhyrrl (for Trello), Eisen, Michael Darkmoor, Lyneira, Baroness Galaxy and many others. They eventually formed the player faction Rock Rats.

### Candy Crew

Formed by a collection of Cmdr's who gained a reputation for risky stunts, tom foolery and all manner of crazy shenanigans!

Building towers and arches from ships at way points, launching SRV's into space (on the backs of ships), organising SRV races and Destruction Derby's and host of daring stunts, including the infamous way point 5 explosion...

Founding Members: Raijiin, Nookie Mr. Smith, Katazz Trofee, SyntheticEQ, Astromiko, Isokix, Krollin, Mogriax, BigNiko, Byped, Jonathan Thal, Johnny Dietz, Rewision, Rokkuon, CCNinja86, Aterfax, Absolute PK, Squid509, Eskimo, Darragh, Saal, Zer0Skill, Thomas8472, Hikedi, DpJon, Hyperious, Ra'Senche.

The Candy Crew Guild was formed during and after the exploration trip so that the memory and group may stay together and keep up the shenanigans they had become notorious for. 

### **Wasp Radio**^[6]^

 	 	[![Wasp radio logo](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/52/Wasp_radio_logo.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20171113170128)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/52/Wasp_radio_logo.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20171113170128) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Wasp Radio Logo
 		 	 

The Expeditions radio station ran out of the Distant World's Flagship, Zombie Wasp III (Later Zombie Wasp IV.)

It played an eclectic selection of music tied to the main theme, "Travel, exploration and Loneliness" The playlist of musics grew as CMDRs recommended music to add to the radio station. The expedition had 5 playlists that it alternated between days. Radio Hosts are Olivia Vespera, iDragox, Sternmann, Zelryn

### Fleet Security

CMDR Shascar Vas, JDude1 and Fulst organised security for the fleet during and around base camps to prevent potential terrorists or space mad explorers from destroying expedition ships.^[7]^ Interesting Security scares included an Unknown entity reported near Saggitarius A, Tight Security around Edward Lewis's Meetup with the DWE group at Beagle Point, and the occasional Overzealous Pilot at a waypoint. This team had a private Skype chatroom where many of the leadership could share any security news they had become aware of with the security team. Most of the Security team were armed with weapons able to deter most normal exploration fitted threats.

### Newletter Team

 	 	[![DWE newsletter](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/a/a9/DWE_newsletter.PNG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/220?cb=20171114134901)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/a/a9/DWE_newsletter.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20171114134901)

### EDSM Expedition tracker

EDSM provided support for the expedition by allowing members to track the fleets progress on an expedition page that showed fleet waypoint completion percentages as well as a 3D map of all distant worlders who shared trilaterated system data with EDSM.

It was the first instance of expedition tracking that has become a staple component of all future expeditions.

## Notable Events

### Spot the Wasp

Spot the Wasp was a game amongst members where CMDRs could rendezvous with the expedition flagship during it's journey between WPs and take a candid photo with it.^[9]^ Its success was largely due to the flagship being the only registered Type-9 Heavy in the fleet and its vibrant orange colour. The flagship lumbered at a slow enough pace that most expedition ships could catch up to it.

### Sagittarius A\* Star record breaking mass instancing and mass jump

What started as a photo opportunity with Dr.Kaii and Erimus, shortly thereafter turned into an epic battle to see how

### Climbing Greeroi's Mountain

 	  	 	 			   	 	 		 			 		 		 			
Elite- Dangerous - Epic (and Deadly!) Mountain Climb - Distant Worlds
 		 		 	 

Greeroi Mountain is located next to the base camp for Waypoint 18.

It is dwarfs the basecamp, standing at 18km. Several explorers had launched mini-expedition to climb and "conquer" the mountain. The Mountain is described as both epic and deadly with high slopes and several false peaks. Attempts by some pilots to scale the mountain had lost them their SRVs, failing the climb.

The few that made it to the top managed to take in the view of the base camp planet as well as the base camp itself.

### Beagle Point Week

There were several event planned each day include games that were invented during the course of the expedition.

Most notable was the first extra-bubble wedding, at Beagle Point.

There was also Sagittarius-Carina Mission Q & A Session in FleetComm, short trips to Podar and the Treehouse, Whack-a-Rat, SRV Destruction derby

A week of fun filled activities where several expedition games were invented.

#### Beagle Point Wedding

 	  	 	 			   	 	 		 			 		 		 			
Elite- Dangerous - Distant Worlds- A Distant Wedding
 		 		 	 

Darwin's Legacy hosted the furthest wedding between CMDR Johnathan Thal and Elena.

The Flagship's CMDR, Olivia Vespera married them under and archway of ships made by distant world friends.

### Salome's Warning

 	  	 	 			   	 	 		 			 		 		 			
Elite Dangerous Distant Worlds - Salomé's Message
 		 		 	 

It was rumoured that Salome had been travelling with the expedition. During the Beagle Point week, Salome reavealed herself and her entourage of Children of Raxxla members after having a meeting. She warned that the data we carried was important and should be wary of who we give it to. [add a quote from the video]

### Arrival of FGE Sub-fleet

On the arrival of the FGE sub-fleet, [insert informaton here]

### Failure of Jaques' Station

Inspired by the actions of the members of the Distant Worlds Expedition, Jaques' Station, with the aid of the Fuel Rats initiated a Community Goal to initiate one big jump to Beagle Point. Several CMDRs awaited Jaques arrival at Beagle Point after the completion of the CG.

While Jaques had successfully jumped, His station had not arrived at Beagle Point and had not been found for several weeks. A grid searh of Darwin's Legacy, the second planet of Beagle Point where the last base camp was situated was organized by CMDR Erimus to no avail.

Jaques Station was later found by CMDR Cly in a system known as Eol Prou RS-T d3-94.

## Impact

### Attention in the wider gaming world

Numerous gaming news outlets took noticed of the Distant Worlds Expedition prior to and during the expedition. A list can be found under External Links

### Exploration Community - visibility, interest, and spin-off expeditions

Interest in exploration and topics exploded since Distant Worlds Expedition. Expeditions started coming out of the woodwork in all manner of sizes and types.

### Fleetcomm - resources for expeditions to come

The Kamzel (Group K) private group was renamed to Fleetcomm and has since been used as the premier private group to host major expeditions since - just as the companion Fleetcomm discord group continues to provide essential fleet communication services.

### Explorer's Legacies - never to return

5 units of Lavian Brandy were set aside at Beagle Point to be passed from Explorer to Explorer in "a continued, unbroken and never-ending chain of the spirit of exploration, wanderlust and well wishes to future expeditions."^[10]^ While the *Wanderlust* legacy was lost with the ship carrying it, the other four continue to traverse the galaxy to this day.

### Official Recognition

Frontier gave all DWE CMDRs who reached Beagle Point by Beagle Week the game's first exclusive player decal, featuring the Distant Worlds Expedition logo. In a game update in May 2016, the system itself was renamed from Ceeckia ZQ-L c24-0 to Beagle Point in game.

## Distant Worlds II

See Distant Worlds II.

On the 10th October 3303, CMDR Erimus made an early announcement for the sequel in Q4 3304/Q1 3305^[11]^

**Candyball Enduro Rally**

This was one of the largest attended SRV races during the trip. Organised mostly by CMDR Raiijin , who on the day almost missed the event because he had an appoitnment with the doctors. The race was filled with explosions, screams of joy and lots of whoops! Most of all though everyone had fun.

**Content Creators Cup**

This event was organised by CMDR Astromiko for the content creators on YouTube to get together for the first time in one place. We had all heard them on there respective channels but never had they all been in one place at once. Kudos to AstroMiko for the idea. The event was in the form of an SRV race (not race) which turned out to be a hilarious mish mash of blunders and explostions.

**Krollins Crater**

This was the moment when CMDR Krollin decided to pancake into the surface of Drakes Ridge, Base Camp 5 of the Distant Worlds Expedition. No cats were harmed during the making of this movie! All exploration data lost was at the expense of num nuts CMDR Krollin. Views expressed don't do this video justice.
