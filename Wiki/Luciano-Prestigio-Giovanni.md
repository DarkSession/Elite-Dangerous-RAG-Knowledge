Pilot

Commander **Luciano "Luko" Prestigio Giovanni** was an independent pilot who befriended Kahina Tijani Loren. He crash landed on a deserted planet in the LTT 8740 system years before Loren did, and used parts from her ship to finish repairing his so they could both leave.^[1]^ Giovanni flew an almost 200-year old Cobra MkIII named the *Bella Principessa*. He was killed in 3303 when the *Bella Principessa* was destroyed in battle against the Thargoids. The *Bella Principessa* and Loren's own ship, the *Seven Veils*, had been hyperdicted by a Thargoid fleet in an unknown system in the Col 70 sector, and Giovanni sacrificed himself to buy time for Loren and her other allies to escape.^[2]^
