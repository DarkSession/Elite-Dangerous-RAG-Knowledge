> The Cockpit Voice Assistant (COVAS) relays real-time information about your ship and your surroundings via your helmet, and is in essence your ship's 'voice'. The Pilots Federation has approved some new COVAS variations, giving Commanders new ways to personalise their flight experience. Each ship comes equipped with Verity and Victor COVAS options by default.

COVAS primarily provides audio notifications for certain ship functions and statuses, such as the countdown to a hyperspace jump, deploying or retracting landing gear, fuel scooping, when another ship has initiated a scan, and when the ship is under attack.^[3]^

The COVAS of a ship can be changed at Starport Services in the livery customization section. The SRV and SLF COVAS can be changed in the SRV and SLF customization bay respectively.^[3]^
