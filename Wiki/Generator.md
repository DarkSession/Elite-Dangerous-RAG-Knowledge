# Generator
A Generator
 		 	 

**Generators** are destroyable objects found in Settlements that are responsible for powering various settlement features, such as turret grids or security forcefields; destroying the generator will thus disable the associated equipment. They are an infrequent mission target, where a specific generator at a Settlement must be destroyed in order to complete the mission's objectives.

Generators are not particularly durable, but attacking them is considered an offense against the owning faction and result in a bounty alongside drawing the attention of any local defenders. Note that some Generators will also automatically come back online and restore functionality to disabled systems after a short delay.

Generator types include;

- **Security System Power Grid:** Powers local Force Fields.
- **Emplacement Power Grid:** Powers a network of local Defence Turrets.
- **Fuel Depot Power Grid:** Found near landing pads; occasional mission target.
