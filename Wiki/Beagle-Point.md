> Beagle Point marks the end point of a galaxy-spanning expedition undertaken by Commander Kamzel in 3301. At the time, the system was known as Ceeckia ZQ-L c24-0, but Kamzel nicknamed it Beagle Point after his beloved beagle Jack, who had passed away a short time before. One year later, the system was chosen as the final destination of the first Distant Worlds expedition, resulting in an influx of over 500 pilots in April 3302. In recognition of these events, Universal Cartographics officially renamed the system Beagle Point on the 26th of May 3302.

**Beagle Point** (formerly designated **Ceeckia ZQ-L c24-0**) is a system in The Abyss. It is one of the most remote discovered star systems in the Milky Way galaxy, at a distance of 65,279 Light Years from Sol, and reaching it requires a ship with a minimum jump range of 34LY. Traveling to Beagle Point and returning to the Core Systems intact is considered an arduous milestone for any explorer, above and beyond the trek to Sagittarius A\* yet a step below making a successful crossing to Oevasy SG-Y d0, the most distant reachable system from Sol.

## Travelling to Beagle Point

### Equipment

- **Patience**. This is key to all long-range explorations, but for this journey, you will need it more than ever before. You have to understand that going on a trip to Beagle Point is willing to do thousands of FSD jumps, visiting thousands of stars/planets, scanning as much as you can, eventually stopping at some points on your route for advanced exploration or for collecting resources on planets. All this over the span of several weeks/months with the constant pressure of death (Be it to module malfunction, lack of attention or even crash on a high-gravity planet) out there in the black. Since this is a very tiring journey, you lose focus quicker than you may think, and before you realize it you will probably jump in a system & without enough fuel to jump anywhere out of it.
- **Good exploration ship**with optimized outfitting. See Explorer for recommendations. Just like any other long-range exploration, take all the necessary gear such as:
    - Fuel Scoop
    - A-grade Frame Shift Drive with Increased Range Engineering mod and Deep Charge or Mass Manager Experimental Effect
    - Guardian Frame Shift Drive Booster
    - Detailed Surface Scanner
    - D-rated modules with Engineering mods that reduce their mass where applicable
    - FSD Injection Materials
    - At least one Auto Field-Maintenance Unit for emergency module repairs; two AFMUs is recommended, since this allows one AFMU to repair the other in the event either sustains damage
    - Planetary Vehicle Hangar for planet exploration and Raw Material prospecting

Milky Way from Beagle Point
 		 	 
- Aside from the common hazards of exploration, there is an area of the galaxy you should **CAREFULLY** be on the lookout for: The Abyss. It is located in the northern part of the Milky Way, in-between the Scutum-Centaurus & the Sagittarius-Carina arms. The Abyss is approximately 45,000 lightyears long, 2,000 lightyears wide and has **extremely low** star density, so low that it feels like staring at an abyss. Even with today's FSD technologies & upgrades, crossing the Abyss still proves to be an extremely difficult challenge.
- **Manual plotting is highly advised!** Trying to plot the route automatically might very often lead you in a dead end. You will want to look up guides/routes from other explorers as well. Be sure to carefully trace your route & pick as much scoopable stars as possible, because...
- ...Fuel is your **number one priority**. Since the systems are very far from one another, the threat of not having enough fuel for next jump is extremely high. And if you happen by sheer bad luck to be in a system with an unscoopable star that you can't jump out of, your last hope will be to call the Fuel Rats for help. Or be left alone with fuel slowly running out & die, losing all your hard work (And perhaps your motivation for a second trip) in the process.

Generally, reaching Beagle Point and returning back to the bubble alive is a guaranteed way of getting Elite rank in Exploration. All the exploration data you will have gathered can easily number in the hundreds of millions of credits, if you scanned enough systems on the way. You will also most certainly encounter lots of undiscovered systems, which will all net you a +50% CR bonus for the first discovery.

## Notes

- CMDR Kamzel unofficially named the system "Beagle Point" after his ship, an Asp Explorer dubbed the DSS Beagle, which was itself named for his late pet beagle, Jack.
- Beagle Point featured as the main destination of the Distant Worlds Expedition^[1]^ that launched a year later on January 18, 3302, in which 1,153 players pledged to participate in a massive coordinated journey to Beagle Point with the goal of scanning as many systems as possible along the way. Only 571 players, less than 50% of the original fleet, confirmed that they had reached Beagle Point at the end of the expedition. ^[2]^ Beagle Point also featured as the main destination of the follow-up Distant Worlds II expedition in 3305.
- Ceeckia ZQ-L c24-0 was officially renamed "Beagle Point" by Frontier Developments on May 26, 3302 to commemorate its importance to the exploration community.
- Jaques Station, the only space station equipped for continuous star travel, attempted an extreme long-range jump to Beagle Point from Gliese 1269 on May 21, 3302, following a successful community goal to provide the station with fuel. Due to Thargoid Sensor interference, the station's drives malfunctioned during the jump and it was stranded in the system of Eol Prou RS-T d3-94, later renamed Colonia. Jaques Station's unintended stranding spurred hundreds of pilots to come to his aid, resulting in the settlement of the Colonia Region and the establishment of the Colonia Connection Highway.
- Beagle Point is 547.52 LY away from Oevasy SG-Y d0, the furthest reachable system in the Milky Way galaxy from Sol.
