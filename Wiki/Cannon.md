## Usage

Cannons are a highly specialized weapon, designed for precision damage against modules and punching above their class with extremely high efficiency. In service of this design, they are dramatically more powerful in smaller sizes and on fixed mountings. Notably, cannons have different projectile velocities at different sizes.

Comparing cannons with multi-cannons, both deal kinetic damage, but the similarities end there. Cannons are better as fixed weapons, while multicannons serve better on a gimballed mount. Multicannons are best at general hull damage, while cannons are more adept at module damage. While multi-cannons are a reliable damage dealer, rate of damage is gradual and much may be deflected by Armour Hardness. In contrast, cannons do much more damage with a single hit and have relatively high armour piercing values and an exceptionally high hull breach chance, but they also have a low rate of fire and a small magazine size with a long reload time, making them one of the trickier type of weapons to use effectively.

There are behavioral similarities between cannons and plasma accelerators (both fire slow moving projectiles at a slow rate of fire). However, the plasma accelerator deals both thermal and kinetic damage, a fraction of which is absolute, meaning it negates the resistances on the target's shield or hull to deal full damage. In exchange, accelerators are dramatically less efficient, and serve as a less-specialized primary weapon.

On the whole, Cannons are a powerful weapon type if used correctly, but require a carefully-designed build and significant player skill to shine.

## Specifications

Projectile speed varies from 1200 m/s (fixed 1D) to 800 m/s (turreted 3D).

Maximum range is 3000m for class 1, 3500m for class 2, 4000m for class 3, and 4500m for class 4. There is no Damage Falloff: they always do full damage regardless of range.
