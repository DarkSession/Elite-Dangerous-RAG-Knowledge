The effect makes the targets radar display more difficult to read, allowing the user to maneuver less predictably. At great range, the user can drop from the targets sensors completely, as well as lose resolution in the targeting reticule. 

## Applicability

This effect is available to the following weapons:

- Fragment Cannon
- Plasma Accelerator

## Materials Required

- 4x Manganese
- 5x Mechanical Scrap
- 5x Mechanical Components
- 5x Hybrid Capacitors
