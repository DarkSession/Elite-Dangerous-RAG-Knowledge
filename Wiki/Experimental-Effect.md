# Experimental Effect
An **Experimental Effect**, formerly known as a **Special Effect**, is a bonus modification that an Engineer can apply to a weapon or module that already has an Engineering modification of any quality grade. Depending on which Experimental Effect is chosen, they can be used to further enhance the modification's potency or balance out its shortcomings. They have a small, one-time cost of up to four different Materials, and a weapon or module can only have one Experimental Effect applied to it at a time. While most Experimental Effects can be applied to a wide variety of weapons and modules, some are specific to only one. Experimental Effects can only be applied at Engineer Workshops, and are unavailable in the Remote Workshops found elsewhere.
