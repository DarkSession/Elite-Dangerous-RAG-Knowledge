Federal Navy Admiral

**Yorke** is an admiral of the Federal Navy. In May 3302, Yorke oversaw the integration of the Neits system into the Federation following a conflict there between Federal and Imperial factions. In June 3302, he led the Federal Navy's successful defence of the Daramo system against an invasion spearheaded by the Imperial Navy and Kumo Crew.

## Timeline

27 JUN 3302

- Following three days of conflict, the Independents of Daramo have confirmed that the Federation has successfully resisted the Imperial offensive in the Daramo system. In the wake of the victory, Admiral Yorke of the Federal Navy extended his gratitude to the many pilots who supported the Federation, and added: "Hopefully this episode will remind our enemies that they cannot simply take whatever they want. It was not so long ago that the Empire was nothing more than a gaggle of clueless colonists on Achenar 6d, while the Federation controlled over a thousand systems. The Empire should remember where it came from." Territorial disputes between the Federation and the Empire are not uncommon, but the strength of Admiral Yorke's words, and in particular the use of "enemies", will no doubt trigger considerable debate on the current state Federation-Empire relationship.^[1]^

23 JUN 3302

- The Daramo system is currently under Federal control, but recent reports indicate that both Imperial and independent forces – the latter under the rule of Pirate King Archon Delaine – are attempting to wrest power from the Federation. The Federation is evidently not about to capitulate. In a statement, Admiral Yorke of the Federal Navy said: "The Daramo system is of considerable strategic value to the Federation, and we will not surrender it without a fight. We have issued an emergency call to all Federation-aligned pilots – you are needed in Daramo!" The Empire, predictably, has responded in kind. Captain Danvers of the Imperial Navy said: "In the interest of the wellbeing of the citizens of Daramo, it is imperative that Imperial law be instated as soon as possible. If the Federation is allowed to retain control of the system, the people of Daramo will be sure to suffer." The Independents of Daramo have stepped in to coordinate operations on behalf of the Federation, while the Vaka Citizens of Tradition have been authorised to oversee the Imperial campaign. Both factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 23rd of June 3302.^[2]^

26 MAY 3302

- After a week of intense conflict, Neits Jet Life Ltd confirmed that its forces have successfully neutralised the GR 316 Silver Universal Group in the Neits system. The fighting began when ships belonging to the Federation-aligned Neits Jet Life Ltd came under fire from the GR 316 Silver Universal Group, an Imperial organisation. As the conflict escalated, both sides called in support from independent combat pilots, but ultimately it was Neits Jet Life Ltd who emerged victorious. With the system now under official Federal control, Admiral Yorke of the Federal Navy released the following statement: "The remaining GR 316 Silver Universal Group forces have retreated from Neits, allowing Neits Jet Life Ltd to assume control of the system. Neits will now enjoy all the benefits of being an official Federal enclave, including the protection of the Federal Navy."^[3]^
