# Roleplaying
**Roleplaying** denotes taking on a role of a character and acting with unscripted situations. Such as pretend to have a certain personality, goals, background, accent, abilities and morals which can be similar to the player or completely different. Some role-players use the official lore as a guide to govern their actions. Roleplaying can increase player immersion in the Elite Universe. There's a distinction between what's in-character and out of character.

Roleplaying is possible with other people in a Wing, Multicrew or in the same instance.
