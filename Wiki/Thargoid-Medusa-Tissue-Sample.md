> A sample of bio-mechanical tissue taken from a Thargoid Interceptor-class vessel. This sample has come from a variant known as a Medusa and appears older and more developed than samples taken from both the Cyclops and Basilisk variants with denser biological matter and more intricate technological elements. Tissue samples appear to be highly sought after for research purposes despite the fact that they appear to be highly corrosive.
