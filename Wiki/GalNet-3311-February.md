### Survey Initiative Successful, Says Brewer Corporation

**A recent survey initiative organised by Brewer Corporation has been hailed as a success by CEO Madelyn Teague.**

High quantities of exploration data were handed in at the Trailblazer Echo megaship in the HIP 90578 system. The data will now be analysed by Universal Cartographics to assess the prime locations in each system for permanent human structures.

Teague made the following announcement:

“*We are pleased that so many explorers have contributed to this initiative. The latest wave of survey data will be processed through a recently updated software algorithm for the next phase of preparation, in pursuit of a widespread expansion campaign. That campaign will be led by factions and communities across the core systems*.”

Interest in the survey campaign has been met with enthusiasm by many displaced communities resulting by the Thargoid War, who see talk of a ‘new frontier’ as a chance at a fresh start.

However, the initiative was briefly disrupted by lockdown within the system, initiated by a number of rogue Commanders. This has been perceived by many groups as an attempt to sabotage humanity's first expansion efforts in many years, although their motives remain unclear.

Participants to the campaign can now collect their rewards from the Trailblazer Echo in HIP 90578.

### Independent Colonisation Support Campaign Goes Live

**\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\***

Brewer Corporation has issued a request for deliveries to Starlace Station in the Minerva system.

Brewer COO Mark Rennik is overseeing the second open request by the corporation in a month, following calls for system survey data earlier this month. Rennik’s press release, published through most major news feeds, offered an update on Brewer’s broader colonisation plans.

An excerpt highlighted by Vox Galactica:

“*A key feature of independent colonisation plans is the beacon and suite module used to establish a successful claim. Our secure manufacturing facilities across several systems have been producing considerable stocks of these devices ready to supply outfitters*.”

“*This morning, we held talks with representatives of minor factions on the fringes of populated space. It was suggested – and we agreed - that the initial colonisation efforts carried out with Brewer technology could benefit from mobile market support*.”

“*I have therefore commissioned new additions to the Trailblazer megaship fleet, which will aid in supplying early colony claims. To ensure these megaships are ready for service and sufficiently stocked on time, we call for independent traders to bring specific commodities to Minerva so we can meet our planned two-week deadline*.”

A number of commodities have been requested by Brewer Logistics, the logistical arm of Brewer Corporation, which are detailed within the initiative. Following a recent security incident, a secondary initiative to protect traders in the Minerva system is also underway, with contributions measured in bounty vouchers.

### Powerplay Standings: February 3311

**This month’s analysis of the influence held by key figures in the core systems has arrived, courtesy of Conrad Sterling of Vox Galactica.**

His latest survey of system populations suggests the following five powers enjoy the largest sphere of influence:

Rank 1: Edmund Mahon – 1,431 systems

Rank 2: Aisling Duval – 1,410 systems

Rank 3: Arissa Lavigny-Duval – 1,328 systems

Rank 4: Yuri Grom – 1,020 systems

Rank 5: Li Yong-Rui – 801 systems

The largest increase in system influence belonged to Li Yong-Rui, who can claim an additional 77 systems as supporters.

Vox Galactica will provide another update on the state of the powers next month.

### System Colonisation Equipment Reaches Public Market

**Brewer Corporation’s much-anticipated system colonisation module and claim management process is now available.**

While colonisation technology has existed for over a millennium, a formal claim and colony establishment process for individuals, communities and minor factions has not previously been available. Analysts consider this a moment of historical significance, as viable colony targets will not be dictated by large corporations or superpower governments.

CEO Madelyn Teague shared her enthusiasm at a gala event in Minerva, covered by Vox Galactica:

“*The sheer potential of this process is staggering. I’m delighted that the move towards widespread, community-led expansion was so eagerly endorsed by all three superpowers. System colonisation contacts will be available on starports to facilitate the initial work on a claimed system*.”

“*This is an exciting time, and I can't wait to see how the next few months unfold. Particularly when the latest additions to Brewer Corporation’s Trailblazer fleet are finished next week. That initiative is still ongoing at Starlace Station, by the way!*”

Those looking to begin a new colony are advised to purchase and prepare a suitable transport vessel, as considerable resources are needed to establish a new port in a claimed system.
