The **Second Thargoid War** was an interstellar conflict between humanity, primarily represented by the multinational xenological research organization Aegis with a volunteer militia of independent pilots versus the Thargoids. It began 152 years after the First Thargoid War (3125 - 3151).

The hostilities are speculated to have arisen over a territorial and resource dispute centered on the Pleiades Nebula. This nebula was seeded with Thargoid Barnacles before human colonization efforts of the Pleiades started in 3301. No communication was established between both sides. While it is unclear which side struck first, the Thargoids attacked numerous human Starports, Settlements, and Ships throughout the Core Systems and adjacent regions with little or no provocation. Humanity was forced on the defensive against a technologically-superior foe with the ability to strike from anywhere. The war ended with a human victory on 18 Dec 3310.

### Encounters with the unknown

 	 	[![Thargoid Interceptor Alien Crash Site 1](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/6d/Thargoid_Interceptor_Alien_Crash_Site_1.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20160830202503)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/6d/Thargoid_Interceptor_Alien_Crash_Site_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20160830202503) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Alien Crash Site with an ancient Thargoid Interceptor
 		 	 

In early 3301, Unknown Artefacts were discovered among the cargoes of secret Federal convoys. Their discovery marked the first indication that Thargoids yet existed in the depths of space, though the Artefacts, as well as the similar Unknown Probes that would be found orbiting ammonia worlds in 3302, would not be conclusively linked to the Thargoids until later. Some CMDRs believed that the Artefacts and Probes originated from an entirely unknown alien race, while others asserted that they were examples of experimental human technology. Disputes and speculation over the objects continued for months. Barnacles were also discovered in 3302 in the vicinity of the Pleiades Nebula, but their even more pronounced organic appearance also stymied analysis.

On 30 August 3302, the first alien crash site was discovered on a planet in the Pleiades Sector AB-W b2-4 system by CMDRs Noctrach and Ihazevich. The wreckage was later confirmed by Aegis to be a Thargoid Interceptor that had crashed over 100 years ago.^[3]^^[4]^

 	 	[![Unknown-Ships-Group-Thargoids](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/b7/Unknown-Ships-Group-Thargoids.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20170619070030)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/b7/Unknown-Ships-Group-Thargoids.png/revision/latest?cb=20170619070030) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Thargoid Interceptors
 		 	 

On 5 January 3303, Commander DP Sayre reported the first known encounter with an Unknown Ship, which was later confirmed to be a type of Thargoid vessel and officially reclassified as a Thargoid Interceptor. The Unknown Ship interdicted the CMDR from hyperspace and apparently scanned him before departing to an untraceable destination. The acts of interdicting a target while in hyperspace and leaving an untraceable wake signature were both well beyond the capabilities of human technology. Previously, only the wreckage of these ships had been documented.

Beginning 11 April 3303, reports surfaced of Unknown Ships apparently attacking Federation convoys. Upon dropping out of supercruise at the source of certain distress calls, Commanders arrived in a green, gaseous cloud and their ship was disabled. Multiple Federal Corvette wrecks, bearing luminescent green residue where they were damaged and with their crews apparently dead, were adrift in the cloud, and a single Unknown Ship could be seen jumping away. Presumably, the Unknown Ship destroyed all of the Corvettes on its own in each incident.

On 2 June 3303, CMDR Mobiusetti documented the first known interaction between an Unknown Ship and a Barnacle on Pleiades Sector OI-T C3-7 A 6 at coordinates -42.77, -21.7, which confirmed suspicions that the two were related.^[5]^ Kelvin Masters of the Imperial Herald asserted that the Barnacles indicated that the Thargoids had been active in Maia and Merope long before humanity, and humans had expanded into what the Thargoids considered to be their territory.^[6]^

### Identification and escalation

 	 	[![Thargoids-Return-Message](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/c/c8/Thargoids-Return-Message.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20170613213623)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/c/c8/Thargoids-Return-Message.png/revision/latest?cb=20170613213623) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
CMDR Edward Lewis' message
 		 	 

On 12 June 3303, Professor Palin issued a request for scan and wake signature data from Unknown Ships to be delivered to Orcus Crag in Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7. Palin compared the collected data to older Thargoid samples and confirmed that Unknown Ships were Thargoid in origin. Shortly afterward, Federation military forces seized Palin's research for transport to a Federal research facility, but the fleet never arrived at its destination.^[7]^

On 13 June, wreckage was found with a transmitter which contained a recorded message:

*"This is an urgent message from Commander Edward Lewis. There are forces out there who do not want you to know the truth, but I have to make this public. I found a ship in HIP 17044. A Federal cap ship, shot to pieces. They were carrying the data the Feds stole from Professor Palin. The crew is dead, but they discovered something important about the Unknown Ships. There is a beacon in the wreckage broadcasting a message, over and over. It proves what we suspected. They are back. And the whole galaxy needs to know. The Thargoids have returned."*

 	 	[![Thargoid Attack Aftermath](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/8/8a/Thargoid_Attack_Aftermath.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20170614035734)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/8/8a/Thargoid_Attack_Aftermath.png/revision/latest?cb=20170614035734) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
The destroyed Federal fleet
 		 	 

Two unnamed Farragut-Class Battle Cruisers were located at an Unregistered Comms Beacon approximately 11,000 ls in the direction of the Asterope system from planet 2 in the HIP 17044 system. The capital ships and an accompanying fleet of smaller Federal ships were all heavily damaged, their crews presumably dead, and adrift in the same green, gaseous cloud noted to be a signature of previous Unknown Ship attacks. A transmitter satellite was found among the debris. One Farragut was also discovered to be broadcasting a recording in Morse code in a small, 30-meter zone around its antenna array: *"UNKNOWN VESSELS DETECTED. SERVER PURGE FAILED. SHIP ASSETS LIQUIDATED. PAYLOAD DESTROYED. SHIP STATUS LOST."*^[8]^

Following the incident, on 19 June, the leaders of the Federation, Empire, and Alliance responded to the news that the aliens encountered in the Pleiades Nebula were Thargoids. President Zachary Hudson confirmed that the Federal military had been expanding in recent months in preparation for such a possibility. Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval urged calm and reminded the public that humanity had overcome seemingly insurmountable odds in the past. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon called for caution, arguing that it had not yet been proven that the destroyed Federal ships were the victims of Thargoid attacks, and that much could be learned from an advanced alien race like the Thargoids.^[9]^

### Thargoid Surface Sites

 	 	[![Thargoid Surface Site above](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/62/Thargoid_Surface_Site_above.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20170626232132)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/62/Thargoid_Surface_Site_above.png/revision/latest?cb=20170626232132) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Thargoid Surface Site
 		 	 

Following the incident, CMDRs identified an unknown signal at a listening post in Maia that lead to heavily guarded relay posts. The final listening post had a Caesar Cypher encrypted location for the "nest". They traced it to planet B 1 C in HIP 19026. There, CMDR Lightningwing of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group discovered the first known Thargoid Surface Site.^[10]^^[11]^ These contain functional thargoid Technology.^[6]^

### Pleiades buildup and research efforts

In the wake of the earlier discoveries concerning the Thargoids, numerous state-sponsored and independent initiatives were launched to expand humanity's presence in the Pleiades Nebula. The Indra, a Wells-class Carrier Megaship, was built and deployed by the Empire to HR 1185.^[12]^ The Federation established Blackmount Orbital and Blackmount Habitation in HIP 17692 to monitor Thargoid activity.^[13]^ The Oracle, an Ocellus station, was relocated to Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 to serve as an independent hub for scientific research on the Thargoids.^[14]^ Abroin Universal Plc led a campaign to establish their own Thargoid research base in the Pleiades.^[15]^ The Federation, Empire, and Alliance jointly funded the creation of Aegis, a research organization intended to pool the scientific expertise of the three superpowers to coordinate investigations of the Thargoids; Aegis deployed a station named Donar's Oak to Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55.^[16]^ Sirius Corporation established two outposts in the Merope system, the station Reed's Rest and the surface port Omega Prospect.^[17]^

On 11 August 3303, the Alliance launched a research initiative to build a range of state-of-the-art instruments to analyze various Thargoid materials, such as Unknown Ship Signatures and other objects recovered from Thargoid Surface Sites.^[18]^ The campaign was a success, but due to the nature of the research it would take some time for any results to be achieved.^[19]^

With events unfolding at a rapid pace, the superpowers had until recently struggled to formulate appropriate responses to the Thargoid situation. While Aegis' establishment suggested that the galaxy's leaders were beginning to address the issue, journalist Kelvin Masters offered a more frank analysis in an Imperial Herald article on 25 August 3303: *"The barnacles seem to indicate that the Thargoids were in Maia and Merope long before we were. For all we know, humanity has expanded into what the Thargoids see as their territory. I have no interest in scaremongering, but my belief is that a Thargoid attack could be imminent – their behaviour certainly seems to suggest they are probing us for weaknesses."*^[6]^

### Enemies of the Federation

On 15 September 3303, Chief of Federal Security Admiral Aden Tanner announced that another Thargoid attack had recently occurred in Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55 which resulted in the destruction of multiple Federal vessels, including one Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser. While the motives for this attack were unknown, Admiral Tanner confirmed that the Thargoids were now officially considered enemies of the Federation. President Hudson gave Tanner full authority over the Federal Navy to deal with the Thargoid threat.^[20]^ Amid speculation that Federal forces had provoked the attack, the Federation insisted that black box data from the wreckage indicated no provocation on their part; this was confirmed by Aegis, which had also analyzed data from the attack.^[21]^

The incident spurred all three superpowers to widen Aegis' remit to focus on both research and defence on 21 September 3303. The organization's budget was dramatically increased, and it recruited the Engineers Liz Ryder and Professor Palin to produce a new anti-Thargoid weapon and a scanner for Thargoid ships, respectively.^[22]^^[23]^

## Events

### The Return

 	 	[![Thargoid Attack Aftermath Imperial](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/a/ae/Thargoid_Attack_Aftermath_Imperial.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20171009215019)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/a/ae/Thargoid_Attack_Aftermath_Imperial.png/revision/latest?cb=20171009215019)

On 26 September 3303, independent pilots reported being attacked unprovoked by Thargoid Interceptors at Non-Human Signal Sources. At least one of these attacks, in which CMDR Delta Vee was the victim, occurred at a site with wreckage from an Imperial convoy, which was believed to have been destroyed by the Thargoid ship.^[24]^^[25]^ In addition, Interceptors have demonstrated extreme hostility against any Guardian artefacts jettisoned in their vicinity, using their weapons to destroy them.^[26]^ New Barnacle sites have also been identified, with a greater concentration of the Structures and an octagonal formation that resembles a nascent Thargoid Surface Site.^[27]^

 	 	[![Thargoid-Scout-Ship-Crash](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/63/Thargoid-Scout-Ship-Crash.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20170928232125)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/63/Thargoid-Scout-Ship-Crash.png/revision/latest?cb=20170928232125) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
A Thargoid Scout crash site
 		 	 

Aegis released the AX Missile Rack and AX Xeno Scanner on 28 September 3303. These new devices allowed CMDRs to both scan Interceptors and successfully penetrate their defenses for the first time, a major milestone.^[28]^^[29]^ However, it was also discovered that the Thargoids had begun attacking independent civilian vessels. A heavily-damaged Megaship identified as Samson Class Bulk Cargo Ship BTG-237 was found in Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55, near planet A 5, the victim of Thargoid aggression.^[30]^ To cap off a day filled with new developments, wreckage from a new type of Thargoid vessel, the Thargoid Scout, was also discovered on planet A 3 A in the HIP 17125 system.^[31]^

Despite early successes against the Thargoids in battle thanks to the AX Missile Rack, by 3rd of October the Thargoid vessels had adapted by developing a resistance to the damaging compound within the missiles. Reports also indicated that countermeasures like chaff could no longer prevent Interceptors from locking on, that the Interceptors had begun evading long-range attacks more effectively, and that Thargon drone swarms had become much more accurate.^[32]^ On the 5th of October, the AX Multi-cannon was released. Combined with an AX Missile Rack to expose Thargoid Hearts on Interceptors, this new weapon was able to circumvent the Thargoid's adaptation. Two other anti-Thargoid countermeasures, the Remote Release Flak Launcher and Shutdown Field Neutraliser, were made available over the following weeks, making human pilots more effective against their alien adversaries.

On 6 October 3303, Aegis' military liaison Admiral Aden Tanner confirmed that in recent days, Federal, Imperial, and civilian ships alike had been targeted and destroyed by Thargoids, and that the aliens were scanning the wreckage and seizing escape pods. Tanner reaffirmed that Aegis was dedicated to unraveling the Thargoids' motives.^[33]^ On 12 October, an Aegis spokesperson confirmed that as well as adapting their defenses to human weapons technology, the Thargoids were also rapidly adapting to human strategies and tactics.^[34]^ On 27 October, as losses of Federal Farragut-Class Battle Cruisers and Imperial Majestic-Class Interdictors continued to mount, Admiral Tanner noted that although recent developments like the Shutdown Field Neutraliser had proven effective in protecting conventional spacecraft from Thargoid attacks, difficulties had been encountered in adapting the technology to larger spacecraft. As a result of capital ships' continued vulnerability, Tanner warned that deploying such vessels to protect stations and outposts was not a viable defensive strategy against Thargoids for the time being.^[35]^

#### Operation Andronicus

On 2 November 3303, Aegis launched Operation Andronicus, the first military operation intended to curb Thargoid aggression in the Pleiades Nebula. Admiral Tanner stated that Aegis would be offering substantial monetary rewards to independent pilots for confirmed Thargoid kills.^[36]^ While Operation Andronicus was in effect, the Alliance organization Cooper Research Associates also announced they would reward pilots for the recovery of personal effects and escape pods from Thargoid attack sites.^[37]^ The operation concluded a week later, and both campaigns were hailed as successes.^[38]^^[39]^

#### Enter the Basilisks

 	 	[![Thargoid Interceptor Basilisk Variant 2](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/c/c1/Thargoid_Interceptor_Basilisk_Variant_2.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20171114020537)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/c/c1/Thargoid_Interceptor_Basilisk_Variant_2.png/revision/latest?cb=20171114020537) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
A close-up of a Basilisk Variant
 		 	 

On 13 November 3303, the first sightings of a new variant of Thargoid Interceptor were reported by independent pilots in the Electra system. Classified as the "Basilisk Variant" by the Pilots Federation, these heavily scarred Interceptors possessed demonstrably more powerful offensive and defensive capabilities.^[40]^ Prior to this, only Cyclops Variant Thargoid Interceptors had been encountered. As Basilisk Variants and Cyclops Variants have yet to demonstrate any hostility towards each other, it is unknown if the presence of Basilisk Variants represents an escalation in the ongoing conflict between Thargoids and humans, or the arrival of a second Thargoid faction in the region.^[41]^

With casualties from Thargoid attacks continuing to mount, President Zachary Hudson and Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval issued statements to reassure the public, insisting that the Thargoid presence would likely remain limited to the Pleiades Nebula and that the combined forces of the Federation and Empire could overcome any threat. Despite this optimism, Admiral Aden Tanner stated it was premature to assert that the Thargoids would not advance beyond the Pleiades, but that Aegis was actively investigating the Thargoids' long-term plans.^[42]^

### The Pleiades aflame

#### Station attacks and Medusae

 	 	[![Station Attack The Oracle](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/5f/Station_Attack_The_Oracle.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20171218032156)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/5f/Station_Attack_The_Oracle.png/revision/latest?cb=20171218032156)

14 December 3303 marked the most serious escalation of the Thargoid conflict yet. The stations Titan's Daughter in Taygeta, The Oracle in Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55, and Liman Legacy in HIP 16753 were attacked and severely damaged by Thargoids, disrupting services and making the stations dangerously unstable.^[43]^ Emergency evacuation protocols were activated, and the Pilots Federation extracted the ships of the independent pilots docked at the affected Stations and transferred them to Rescue Vessels. Pilots were encouraged to aid the ongoing evacuation of the stations' inhabitants.^[44]^

 	 	[![Thargoid Interceptor Medusa Variant](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/65/Thargoid_Interceptor_Medusa_Variant.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20171214115908)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/65/Thargoid_Interceptor_Medusa_Variant.png/revision/latest?cb=20171214115908) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
A close-up of a Medusa Variant
 		 	 

The attacks were confirmed to have been carried out by a new variant of Thargoid Interceptor classified as the "Medusa Variant".^[45]^ These ships also began interdicting pilots from hyperspace and appearing in Threat 7 Non-Human Signal Sources. Medusae surpass the capabilities of Basilisk Variant Interceptors, possessing even stronger defenses, more powerful weapons, and the ability to direct an even larger swarm of Thargon drones.^[46]^

The death toll from the station attacks was believed to be in the thousands, but could have been far worse. Starport security feeds indicate that the Medusa Interceptors used their shutdown fields to disable station defenses before targeting the main reactor. An eyewitness speculated that the Thargoids' intent was to cripple the stations, not destroy them outright.^[45]^ While it was not clear why the Thargoids had targeted these three stations specifically and not others, Aegis was investigating the issue.^[47]^

The following week on 21 December as the three stations were stabilized and repair work began on them, further attacks were reported at Bao Landing in HIP 17497, Cavalieri in Electra, and Hudson Observatory in HIP 17694.^[48]^ Medusa Interceptors were once again confirmed to be the culprits, and hundreds more human casualties were tallied.^[49]^ Three more attacks occurred two weeks later on 4 January 3304 at Copernicus Observatory in Asterope, Cyllene Orbital in Atlas, and Artemis Lodge in Celaeno, followed by two attacks on 11 January at Obsidian Orbital in Maia and Reed's Rest in Merope.^[50]^

#### The Liberation of HIP 17692

 	 	[![Thargons-Medusa](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/5f/Thargons-Medusa.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20180111100803)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/5f/Thargons-Medusa.png/revision/latest?cb=20180111100803) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
A Medusa and its Thargon Swarm
 		 	 

Also on 11 January, the Federation and Empire announced a joint initiative to counter Thargoid activity in the HIP 17692 system and attempt to reduce the Thargoids' presence in the Pleiades. The Empire-aligned Merope Expeditionary Fleet took charge of military operations, while the Federation-aligned Pleiades Resource Enterprise coordinated the rescue of attack survivors, personal effects, and data. Fleet Admiral Denton Patreus stated, *"Starports throughout the Pleiades have been attacked. Thousands of lives have been lost. And we have failed to deliver an effective response. That changes now."*^[51]^

The operation marked just over a year since the first encounter with an active Thargoid Interceptor. Political commentator Daxton Sung offered an analysis: *"The situation continues to escalate and our leaders continue to offer the same tired platitudes – militaristic bombast from Hudson, noncommittal banalities from Lavigny-Duval and earnest sympathising from Mahon. It's clear that they have no idea how to counter the Thargoid threat, beyond pumping more money into Aegis's weapons programme."*^[52]^

#### Advance on the Core Systems

 	 	[![ED-Thargoid-Attacked-Stations-Map](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/0/0e/ED-Thargoid-Attacked-Stations-Map.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20180310095916)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/0/0e/ED-Thargoid-Attacked-Stations-Map.png/revision/latest?cb=20180310095916) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
The extent of Thargoid attacks on stations as of February 22, 3304
 		 	 

While the HIP 17692 operation proved to be a success,^[53]^ Thargoid attacks on stations continued unabated on 18 January, striking Kipling Orbital in Pleiades Sector KC-V c2-11 and Malthus Terminal in Pleiades Sector HR-W d1-41. After these attacks, a member of Kipling Orbital's starport personnel noted that the Thargoids seemed to be sweeping the region and slowly moving towards the Core Systems.^[54]^

On 25 January, Borrego's Vision in Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-7 and Kamov Survey in HIP 17892 were hit. On 1 February, Asami Orbital in Pleiades Sector JC-V d2-62 and Cleaver Prospect in Pleiades Sector HR-W d1-57 suffered attacks; both stations were significantly closer to the Core Systems that the targets of the previous attacks. On February 8, Bennington's Restin 42 n Persei and Exodus Point in Hyades Sector AB-W b2-2 were attacked, continuing the trend of the Thargoids' movements. President Zachary Hudson and Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval both issued fresh appeals for aid for the affected stations, and the Emperor also confirmed that Aegis was actively investigating the Thargoids' shift toward the Core Systems.^[55]^

On 15 February, Gaiman Dock in 49 Arietis and Weyn Dock in 64 Arietis were hit, marking the Thargoids' arrival in the outer fringe of the Core Systems. As the public questioned the lack of an effective military response to the Thargoids, Imperial Senator Gianna Tachibana asserted that humanity was being reactive rather than proactive, and that the Pleiades were at risk of becoming a no-go zone even with the assistance of independent pilot militias and Aegis's research.^[56]^ Meanwhile, the Federation launched the Bulwark Project, an initiative to develop autonomous military hardware to combat the Thargoids. While Imperial commentators criticized the initiative as a circumvention of long-standing conventions against the development of artificial intelligence, Federal Shadow President Felicia Winters dismissed those concerns, claiming that the Bulwark Project's purpose was to *"investigate alternate defence strategies, not to develop machine intelligence"*.^[57]^ The Bulwark Project campaign was later successful, but Winters was careful to note that the Project's initial remit was merely to determine the economic and military feasibility of the creation of a fully-automated defence force.^[58]^

On 22 February, Armstrong Enterprise in Bhal and Beaufoy Vision in Nauni, both locations within the Core Systems, suffered Thargoid attacks. Coinciding with these latest incidents, Fleet Admiral Patreus coordinated a second Federal-Imperial joint operation against the Thargoids, this time centered on the Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7 and Arietis Sector XE-Z b4 systems.^[59]^ The operation was subsequently declared a success.^[60]^ Notably, no additional Thargoid attacks occurred on 1 March, marking the first lull in the incursion, although sightings and encounters with Thargoid Interceptors began occurring at various locations within the Core Systems, with hostile Thargoid Scout Marauders now appearing as well.^[61]^

#### Eagle Eye

Eagle Eye Four orbiting HIP 17225 A 5
 		 	 

On 9 March, Aegis unveiled a new initiative called Eagle Eye. Six orbital surveillance installations were set up in HIP 17225, HIP 17692, HIP 17892, HR 1185, Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55, and Pleiades Sector KC-V c2-4 in order to monitor known Thargoid Surface Sites and collect data on Thargoid behavior outside of combat zones.^[62]^ By 16 March, Aegis reported that Eagle Eye was already producing results. According to Admiral Tanner, the installations were able to track fluctuations in transmissions originating from Thargoid Surface Sites, and that these transmissions pointed to specific locations in human space which were likely future Thargoid attack targets. Tanner urged independent pilots to investigate a new set of signals detected by Eagle Eye to help thwart the Thargoids' plans.^[63]^

### War in the Core

#### The Purge of Socho

With the Thargoids now wreaking havoc well within the Core Systems, Aegis began coordinating the first counterattack. On 15 March 3304, Aegis Core announced an anti-Thargoid campaign in its home system of Socho. The operation's goal was not only to expel Thargoid forces from Socho, but to obtain specific technological components from Thargoid Interceptors and Scouts for comparison research.^[64]^ The operation concluded successfully.^[65]^

#### Revelations

On 22 March 3304, Aegis published a report containing significant insights into the Thargoids that had been gleaned with the help of Ram Tah and his Guardian research. The findings indicated that the Thargoids had warred with the Guardians because of the latter's perceived encroachment on territory that the Thargoids had seeded with Barnacles millennia earlier. Despite attempts by the Guardians to communicate with the Thargoids, the Thargoids' survival instincts were so strong that they refused to tolerate any potential threat and continued hostilities until the Guardians eventually expelled them using automated war machines. Professor Alba Tesreau commented that the Guardians' situation mirrored humanity's own: the Thargoids had long ago seeded territory that humans had unknowingly expanded into, and the current conflict was essentially a dispute over territory and resources. Tesreau asserted that the next step the Thargoids would take would be to aggressively mine mineral resources. Ram Tah noted that these revelations finally provided some answers about the Thargoids' overall goals and could ultimately aid humanity in the conflict.^[66]^

#### Onslaught and trepidation

 	 	[![Thargoid attacks May 10 3304](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/c/cd/Thargoid_attacks_May_10_3304.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20180517033841)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/c/cd/Thargoid_attacks_May_10_3304.png/revision/latest?cb=20180517033841) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
The extent of Thargoid attacks on stations as of May 10, 3304
 		 	 

The same day as Aegis's report made waves in the media, the station Glazkov Terminal in Irandan was attacked by the Thargoids after a month of relative calm. Both Irandan and HIP 21559 had been identified as likely targets for imminent Thargoid attacks by Eagle Eye, but only the latter system had seen a heavy influx of independent combat pilots come to its defense over the preceding week.

The attack on Glazkov Terminal would be only the first of a fresh wave of attacks that would strike deep within the Core Systems. On 30 March, Doyle Landing in Lunguni fell victim of the Thargoids. On 12 April, Guidoni Enterprise in HIP 9599 was attacked. On 19 April, Weil Station in Kunuvii and Eyharts Enterprise in 32 c Piscium were attacked, along with six Bulk Cruiser Megaships found disabled across the LP 581-36, Chan Mina, Deriv-Dar, and Nankul systems. On 26 April, Acton Dock in LP 581-36 was attacked. On 3 May, Sturckow Port in SPOCS 253 was attacked. No stations were attacked during the weeks of 10 May, 17 May, 24 May, 31 May, 7 June, and 14 June as pilots successfully rallied to the defense of the targeted systems.

Meanwhile, also on 22 March, Yuri Grom of the EG Pilots launched a campaign led by the EG Union to construct a new shipyard in CPC 20 6743. A spokesperson for the EG Union explained that the shipyard would construct new Farragut-Class Battle Cruisers to bolster humanity's defenses against a Thargoid invasion.^[67]^ On 30 March, Admiral Tanner formally debuted Aegis's two new military Megaships, the Acropolis and the Vanguard, explaining that they would serve as mobile command centers for anti-Thargoid operations.^[68]^ On April 6, the Privateers Alliance and the Atlas Corporation both took similar approaches to fortifying the Core Systems against the Thargoids. The Privateers Alliance launched a campaign to build a military installation in HIP 33368,^[69]^ while the Atlas Corporation began work on the ACS Overwatch Megaship in Lambda Arae.^[70]^

Despite Aegis's proven successes in the conflict, Princess Aisling Duval controversially criticized the organization on 6 April, stating that she and many other galactic citizens were concerned that Aegis lacked a clear, long-term strategy to combat the Thargoids and was being reactive rather than proactive.^[71]^ While the Princess's opinion had its share of detractors who spoke out in defense of Aegis, others noted that Aegis lacked transparency and had done little to assuage the widespread fear of alien conquest among the public.^[72]^

On 25 April, Simguru Pranav Antal of the Utopia movement addressed an even more controversial possibility: humanity could lose the war against the Thargoids. The Simguru urged galactic citizens to join Utopia and help protect the Sim-Archive to ensure that humanity could live beyond its potential extinction.^[73]^ Pranav Antal's pessimism quickly triggered a backlash from such figures as Shadow President Felicia Winters, Sirius Corporation CEO Li Yong-Rui, and Admiral Tanner.^[74]^ Nonetheless, Utopia doubled down on the Simguru's statement on 4 May, 3304 by launching a project to construct a military installation in its home system of Antal to defend the Sim-Archive from potential Thargoid attack.^[75]^

#### Thargoid worshipers

Meanwhile, as the Thargoid conflict wore on, journalists and scholars began discussing the phenomenon of fringe doomsayer cults proliferating throughout the Core Systems. Independent reporter Gethin Okonkwo published an article on 19 May revealing that dozens of such cults had emerged, and while their natures varied, they were all adamant that the Thargoid conflict was a sign of an imminent apocalypse.^[76]^ On 16 June, exotheologian Dr. Alfred Ulyanov highlighted one unnamed cult that even worshiped the Thargoids as harbingers of an extra-dimensional, omnipotent being they called the Far God. The cult's followers believed that only they would survive the Far God's manifestation in this universe, and gathered in hive-chapels patterned after Thargoid vessel and structure designs.^[77]^

The "Far God cult", as the sect came to be called, quickly garnered hostile reactions from the public despite local authorities' calls for tolerance and the cultists' own silent refusal to defend themselves or even plead for protection.^[78]^ Mistrust of the cult only continued to grow, however, and on 5 July reporter Flint "Firemaker" Lafosse stoked tensions further with speculation that the reclusive Thargoid cult was a *"fifth column"* of brainwashed abduction victims sent back to human systems as spies and saboteurs.^[79]^ On 11 July 3304, the Church of the Eternal Void, another doomsayer cult that worshiped the Guardians, publicly denounced the Far God cult and declared a holy war against it. In response, security forces in multiple systems issued reminders that the Thargoid cult was a legally-recognized religion.^[80]^ This did not deter the Church from inciting numerous attacks against the Far God cult across multiple systems. Several of the sect's places of worship were firebombed, resulting in dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries. The Far God cultists offered no resistance to the aggression, and even refused to leave their burning hive-chapels.^[81]^ On 25 July, after hundreds of cultists had been killed, the Church of the Eternal Void was declared illegal by local authorities in every system where it operated, and the Church's leadership was arrested for inciting violence against the Far God cult.^[82]^

Only days later on 3 August, the Federal Intelligence Agency launched an investigation into the Far God cult. Several members of the sect were arrested for interrogation, which FIA Senior Agent Micah Whitefield declared was a necessary action to confirm that they were not in contact with Thargoid forces nor being influenced by them.^[83]^ As the focus of the arrests expanded to the entire cult, Senior Agent Whitefield insisted that the operation was a security matter that was justified under Federal law in wartime. Media channels reported a division in public opinion regarding the FIA's actions.^[84]^

On 23 August, the Federal Intelligence Agency reported that Far God cult members were disappearing in large numbers. Hive-chapels in Federal space raided by the FIA were found empty, and reports from independent systems stated that entire chapters of the cult were disappearing overnight. Senior Agent Whitefield believed that the cultists were attempting to leave the cult and return to normal life, but here were no known cases of Far God cultists returning to their friends or family, and the disappearances remained a mystery.^[85]^ Independent pilots tracking leads provided by Aegis's Eagle Eye array uncovered vital clues explaining the disappearances of the Far God cultists. Two compounds belonging to the cult were discovered in the Etain system: "The Prophet" at Etain 4 C, and "The Sanctum" at Etain 4 A. Both sites had recently been attacked by Thargoids, and while there was no indication of survivors, personal audio logs recorded by the cultists revealed that they had retreated from their hive-chapels elsewhere and gathered at these secluded locations to be placed into cryogenic stasis while awaiting the arrival of the Far God and their expected ascendancy.^[86]^

On 21 September, independent reporter Gethin Okonkwo, who was previously thought missing, revealed that he had been living undercover within the Far God cult for the past three months. In an op-ed piece, Mr. Okonkwo shared his experiences: *"At no point did I see evidence of actual contact with the Thargoids, bar the occasional use of alien material as holy artefacts. Most worshippers are essentially fatalists, attracted to the idea of an apocalypse. Some are convinced that they alone will survive the Far God's manifestation. It is a strange and often contradictory faith, but no less so than other religions. I recorded my experiences within the sect using concealed micro-cameras. I am voluntarily sharing this data with the Federal Intelligence Agency to prove that the Far God sect is not dangerous, and with the hope of ending its persecution."*^[87]^ Senior Agent Micah Whitefield announced on September 29 that the FIA had closed its investigation of the Far God cult. Whitefield told the media, *"The information provided by Gethin Okonkwo on the inner workings of the Far God sect has been verified as genuine. In the absence of any evidence regarding communication with the Thargoids, our investigation is concluded. All worshippers who were detained have now been released. We are indebted to Mr Okonkwo for his highly detailed report. We had hoped to gain similar insights via our own undercover agent, who infiltrated the sect, but we are still awaiting his report."*^[88]^

#### A fleeting victory

On 21 June 3304, the Thargoids ended humanity's string of victories with an attack on Hennepin Prospect in Assinda. The attack appeared to be an outlier rather than an indication of Thargoid resurgence, however, as Eagle Eye did not intercept any new signals from Thargoid sites, and all Eagle Eye installations began transmitting the same message: *"no new signal detected thargoid activity unknown initiate protocol xeno 55"*. That same day, Aegis also declared that the Thargoids were retreating from the Core Systems and had been pushed back to their original beachhead of Bhal. Admiral Tanner thanked Commanders for their efforts in defending the Core Systems, but noted that while Thargoid incursions had been reversed in many regions, the Thargoids remained entrenched in the Pleiades Nebula.^[89]^

 	 	[![Thargoid Scouts 3.1](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/2/2d/Thargoid_Scouts_3.1.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20180628235100)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/2/2d/Thargoid_Scouts_3.1.png/revision/latest?cb=20180628235100) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
A Thargoid Scout Berserker (center), Regenerator (left), and Inciter (right)
 		 	 

On 28 June, Aegis reported that Eagle Eye had detected a massive surge in Thargoid transmissions. Admiral Tanner asserted that the previous week's lull in activity in the Core Systems must have been only a brief delay while the Thargoids regrouped and summoned reinforcements from the Pleiades. Tanner issued an emergency call for aid for Garay Terminal in Deciat, which Eagle Eye identified as the Thargoids' main target; a number of disabled megaships had already been found in the system. A transmission from an unknown Commander in the Deciat system also indicated that a new type of Thargoid Scout was present among the invading force.^[90]^ Three new types of Scouts were subsequently identified: the Berserker, the Regenerator, and the Inciter. The Berserker is a more powerful and aggressive variant of the Marauder, while the Regenerator possesses the ability to restore the hull of other damaged Scouts and the Inciter can enhance their weaponry.

While Deciat was successfully defended against the Thargoid assault, Eagle Eye confirmed on 5 July 3304 that the Thargoids had resumed their original pattern of activity, targeting systems for an eventual attack and massing their forces there in preparation for it. Parise Station in Tembala was attacked on 12 July, followed by Metcalf Station in HIP 44811 on 19 July, both Preuss Terminal in Di Jian and Zudov Hub in RMK 6 on 26 July, and Plucker Enterprise in Dhanhopi on 2 August.

#### Settlement attacks and crash sites

Meanwhile, independent pilots patrolling the Pleiades Nebula discovered various listening posts that were monitoring certain planetside locations in various systems. Upon investigation, each site was found to be either a surface settlement or a crashed ship that had been attacked by Thargoids shortly after their return. Among the sites were the settlements Dominic's Corner, Scrump Landing, Sharpe Works, Site 94, Betterton Outpost, Penal Colony BV-2259, Comms Facility 89563, Research Base LV 8, Research Base KG-3362, and a crashed Anaconda named "The Bug Killer". While some of the settlements managed to evacuate before they were attacked, others were not so lucky, and recovered logs indicated that some survivors may have been abducted by the Thargoids. Peculiarly, a number of the logs also noted abrupt, widespread temperature decreases that preceded or coincided with the Thargoid attacks. More recent attack sites were found on 30 August 3304: The Prophet and The Sanctum, two "void-temples" that belonged to the Far God cult.

#### Hydras emerge

 	 	[![Thargoid-Hydra-Interceptor](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/e/e9/Thargoid-Hydra-Interceptor.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20180916190338)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/e/e9/Thargoid-Hydra-Interceptor.png/revision/latest?cb=20180916190338) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
A Thargoid Interceptor Hydra
 		 	 

A fourth Thargoid Interceptor type, the "Hydra Variant", began appearing on 28 August 3304 in Threat Level 9 Non-Human Signal Sources.^[91]^ The Hydra exhibited even more complex structural features than the Medusa, most notably four additional rotating petals behind the standard eight petals, as well as a vivid green coloration. Following the trend of the previous Interceptor variants, the Hydra's offensive and defensive capabilities demonstrated a significant increase over its predecessors, making it the Thargoids' most fearsome weapon yet.^[92]^ The Hydras' emergence coincided with the sudden and unexplained disappearance of all Thargoid Scouts from the Core Systems and the Pleiades Nebula that week.^[93]^

The Pilots Federation confirmed independent pilots' reports of the new ship the following day. Admiral Aden Tanner also provided Aegis's preliminary findings: *"We can confirm that this new ship – classified as the Hydra – is a variant of the Thargoid Interceptor. It is structurally stronger than the Cyclops, Basilisk or Medusa, and releases a larger swarm of Thargon drones."* In response to this development, the Pilots Federation sealed off the Cone Sector FN-J b9-0 system, which was believed to contain high concentrations of Hydra Interceptors. Despite this, The Gnosis, flagship of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group, confirmed that it would still attempt to jump into the now permit-locked system as scheduled on 6 September.^[94]^

Shortly after The Gnosis began the jump to Cone Sector FN-J b9-0 from Outotz ST-I d9-4 on 6 September, it was interrupted by a Thargoid attack. Captain Mathius Leander of the Gnosis command crew transmitted the following emergency message: *"We were a short way into our journey when the Gnosis was hyperdicted by a group of Thargoid vessels. The wrench back into real space caused severe internal damage to multiple systems, including the frame shift drive. There's no doubt that we would have been destroyed if not for some of the Commanders travelling with us. They lured the Thargoids away while ejecting meta-alloys from their holds. The aliens were more interested in scooping up the meta-alloys than attacking us. The Commanders later reported that the Thargoid vessels were the recently identified Hydra Interceptors. The Gnosis is currently adrift close to the eighth planet of the Outotz ST-I d9-6 system. We have begun essential repairs, but there is a risk that the Thargoids may return before we can escape the system."*^[95]^ The Thargoids ceased their attacks on The Gnosis and retreated from the system on September 13, 3304. The Gnosis was able complete repairs and departed on 27 September.

#### Expanded offensive

 	 	[![Thargoid attacks December 6 3304](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/6e/Thargoid_attacks_December_6_3304.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20181213214139)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/6e/Thargoid_attacks_December_6_3304.png/revision/latest?cb=20181213214139) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
The extent of Thargoid attacks in the Core Systems as of December 6, 3304
 		 	 

Beginning on 11 October 3304, the Thargoids increased the scale of their attacks from two stations per cycle to three. This proved effective enough to overwhelm humanity's defenses, as every week afterward through December 3304, one to two targeted stations suffered severe damage from the Thargoids. While these stations were still able to recover and begin repairs, the human toll in the war multiplied rapidly compared to previous months.

Aegis debuted a new branch, Aegis Defense, on 27 December 3304 following the Thargoids' most devastating attack yet. Five systems were beset by Incursions, resulting in simultaneous attacks against five stations: Behnken Gateway in Wuli, Bethke Ring in Werapana, Cavalieri in Electra, May Gateway in Kupol Vuh, and Mendez Terminal in Jormbu. With the Acropolis and Vanguard either missing or withdrawn, Aegis instead deployed five new Megaships to the afflicted systems to serve as additional bulwarks for independent pilots fighting the Thargoids in AX Conflict Zones. In addition, GalNet began posting the automatically-updated Thargoid Activity Report, which tracked Thargoid activity levels in systems experiencing an Incursion alongside repair progress for previously damaged stations.

 	 	[![Thargoid attacks April 18 3305](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/19/Thargoid_attacks_April_18_3305.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20190419051549)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/19/Thargoid_attacks_April_18_3305.png/revision/latest?cb=20190419051549) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
The extent of Thargoid attacks in the Core Systems as of April 18, 3305
 		 	 

As the conflict entered 3305, the increasing number of Thargoid attacks began overwhelming human defenses, leaving an ever larger trail of damaged stations that volunteers were struggling to aid. More stations were attacked in first quarter of 3305 than in the whole of 3304. Admiral Aden Tanner discussed the concentrated assault on 18 April 3305: *"What's surprising is that the Thargoids aren't targeting our most important social or military centres, such as the superpowers' home systems. There's no doubt that they're trying to weaken us, but evidently they're guided by different principles than those that typically govern human martial strategy. What we can say is this: with capital ships of limited use against Thargoid craft, independent combat pilots remain our best defence against the Thargoids."*^[96]^ Aegis also announced that it had formally entered a partnership with Ram Tah to boost the production of Guardian-derived modules, which would hopefully increase their availability to anti-Thargoid pilots.^[97]^

### Frontier resurgence

#### Meta-Alloy shortage

On 4 July 3305, reports emerged that harvests of Meta-Alloys were in steep decline, and many known Thargoid Barnacle sites had become exhausted. Professor Alba Tesreau announced an initiative to locate alternative Thargoid Barnacle sites by collecting and analyzing exploration data provided by independent pilots at The Oracle in Delphi.^[98]^ On 11 July Tesreau revealed that the survey had turned up new sites in the Witch Head Nebula, and the Alliance, Empire, and Federation each launched concurrent resource-gathering campaigns in order to build new infrastructure in the region.^[99]^

Coinciding with the Meta-Alloy shortage, on 11 July, Aegis reported that Thargoid forces had, in a matter of hours, completely withdrawn from the Core Systems and the Pleiades Nebula with the exception of the Maia and Merope systems. Admiral Aden Tanner explained that Aegis's two main theories for the Thargoids' departure were that their numbers had been depleted or they were reconsidering their strategy. Whatever the cause, Eagle Eye confirmed the development and reported *"No Activity Detected"* for that cycle. Professor Ishmael Palin urged caution, however, warning that the war with the Thargoids was likely far from over and there was no evidence that human activity had prompted this retreat, especially given the Thargoids' aggressive and territorial nature.^[100]^

Carson's Spring under attack
 		 	 

On 18 July, the Thargoids returned to the Pleiades Nebula in large numbers, attacking three stations without being detected by Eagle Eye and massing in Maia for an attack on Palin Research Centre. Professor Palin and his staff managed to evacuate to the megaship Carson's Spring before the surface port came under fire, but the vessel was attacked and disabled before it could depart Maia. Professor Tesreau asserted that the Thargoids were likely attempting to reassert themselves in their original territorial claim, and requested help from independent pilots in defending Carson's Spring, as local security forces were overwhelmed.^[101]^ Defense efforts were successful, and Admiral Aden Tanner of Aegis reported that Carson's Spring was able to resume its journey to the Arque system on 22 July. Professor Palin began rebuilding his operation at Abel Laboratory on Arque 4 E, ^[102]^ and resumed his research and services on 30 July.^[103]^

#### The Enclave

Cann Relay, one of the Witch Head Nebula starports, after an attack
 		 	 

On 25 July, as Ocellus Starports arrived in six systems in the Witch Head Nebula that had been slated for colonization as part of The Enclave initiative, they were immediately attacked by Thargoid forces that were ostensibly acting to defend their territory. Professor Tesreau called on independent pilots to defend the stations, or else the pioneer factions in charge of the colonization effort would be forced into retreat and access to the new Meta-Alloy sources in the region would consequently be cut off.^[104]^

The response to the request was so impressive that the Pilots Federation opened a new Surface Port with a shipyard, Jackrock Outpost, in the Wellington system less than a day later as a reward for pilots fighting in the region.^[105]^ All six systems were pronounced clear of Thargoid Incursions by the end of 27 July.^[106]^ Admiral Tanner confirmed the victory on 31 July, noting that humanity's colonial assets had been firmly established in the region. Professor Tesreau added that the Alliance, Empire, and Federation had officially declared the Witch Head Nebula to be a human enclave that they would share equally. She also requested the galactic community's assistance in repairing the nebula's starports so that they could begin harvesting the local barnacles.^[107]^

By 6 August, the Witch Head Nebula enclave had begun attracting thousands of migrants looking for a fresh start. Among these was Chloe Sedesi, a former apprentice of Professor Palin who sought to establish an Engineering workshop at Cinder Dock in Shenve. A Technology Broker and Material Trader also planned to move to the area and set up at Bray Landing and Ratchet Hub.^[108]^^[105]^ The second colonization wave arrived on 8 August, resulting in the completion of seven planetary ports, including Chloe Sedesi's workshop. The Technology Broker and Material Trader also arrived ahead of schedule. With repairs to the starports progressing swiftly, Professor Tesreau confirmed that more facilities were planned for the Witch Head Nebula in the coming weeks.^[109]^ Expansion concluded on 5 September, 3305, after six waves of construction. All told, the Witch Head Nebula enclave came to include 16 inhabited systems with 23 ports.

A Thargoid Interceptor Orthrus
 		 	 

While the galaxy's eyes focused on the Witch Head Nebula, there was a strange development in the Pleiades. On 25 August 3305, a fifth Thargoid Interceptor type designated the "Orthrus Variant" was spotted by multiple pilots at the abandoned Palin Research Centre on Maia A 3 A. The Orthrus most closely resembled a standard Cyclops, but with new yellow markings and coloration around the cockpit and along the edges of the petals. The cockpit itself appeared to have been reinforced with additional plating, and the body of the vessel was symmetrically dotted with small protrusions of unknown significance. The capabilities of the Orthrus could not be analysed in full, as it fled to hyperspace immediately upon being encountered and did not engage in combat, but pilots were able to determine that it had five Thargoid Hearts and continuously active shields. Orthrus sightings ceased the following week.^[110]^^[111]^

### An uneasy reprieve

#### Regrouping

The Thargoid attacks on the newly-arrived Witch Head Nebula colonies on 25 July 3305 marked a significant deescalation in the conflict. Following that wave, the Thargoids abruptly ceased launching Incursions, and Eagle Eye detected only nominal Thargoid activity in the same six systems for multiple consecutive cycles. Although Thargoid vessels continued appearing in the Pleiades and Witch Head Nebula and hyperdicting passing human ships, it seemed as though the Thargoids had either reached a point of exhaustion or realised that their strategy to that point was failing to have the desired effect.

Humans seized on this reprieve to focus on repairing damage stations, over a hundred of which had come to languish for months as traders struggled to meet the high demand for resources and further Incursions swelled the casualty list. By 9 January 3306, after 22 weeks without any Incursions, the number of stations still undergoing repairs had been reduced to 61 thanks to the tireless efforts of traders and the relief organisation Operation Ida; by 23 July 3306, all stations that had been damaged by Thargoid attackers were fully repaired.

The lengthy pause in the Second Thargoid War was interrupted on 9 January 3306 with Incursions in six systems, three in the Pleiades Nebula and three in the Witch Head Nebula: Asterope, Atlas, Celaeno, Shenve, Onoros, and Haki. The latter three attacks caught the colonists of the Witch Head Nebula off-guard, causing panic and leading to multiple casualties as local pilots fell to increased numbers of Thargoid craft. Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis commented on 13 January that the Thargoids were likely intent on reclaiming the region for its plentiful barnacle sites. Local authorities began organising a defence force as independent pilots traveled from the distant Core Systems to provide assistance. Rewired pundit Kelvin Masters pointed out that the residents of the Witch Head enclave had become complacent after months of relative peace, and local minor factions were jockeying for influence, abandoning the united front they had previously presented.^[112]^ Despite what many saw as the onset of a new major offensive, however, the war entered another lull following a particularly fierce set of four Incursions on 30 January which took weeks to fully repel.

Another months-long reprieve lasted until 15 October 3306, when Thargoid forces began probing the Witch Head Nebula systems of Onoros, Lembass, Haki, Wellington, and Shenve, all controlled by the Alliance. With neither Aegis nor the Alliance Defence Force in a position to respond to the sudden attacks, the Alliance Expeditionary Pact minor faction deployed a megaship in Onoros, the Golden Stag, and issued a call to independent pilots for aid to prevent the attacks from expanding into a larger invasion of the region.^[113]^ The defence of the Witch Head Nebula was a triumphant success thanks to a massive response from independent pilots. The bulk of the Thargoid assault force was destroyed, and the remainder were driven into retreat.^[114]^

#### Coalsack discovery

The Adamastor orbiting Chukchan 5 B
 		 	 

The discovery of a ghost ship in the Chukchan system led to the unearthing of new details about early contact between humans and Thargoids. The Adamastor, an abandoned megaship of unknown registry, was detected on approach to Chukchan 5 B on 29 October 3306. Tugs were used to wrench it into a safe orbit, where the Alliance Salvage Guild determined that the vessel had been traveling on autopilot at sublight speed since October 3111, when it had originally departed Chukchan on an unknown assignment. Investigation by independent pilots and Benjamin Chester, the retired founder of the Wallglass Investigations Agency, linked the Adamastor to a defunct corporation called Azimuth Biochemicals, as well as a geological survey site found on Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 3 in the Coalsack Nebula.^[115]^^[116]^

Analysis of recovered logs indicated that Azimuth had hired a science team led by Professor Penelope Carver to survey the Coalsack Nebula in 3111. The team discovered Thargoid Barnacles and a crashed Thargoid Interceptor, from which they retrieved an unidentified object. Azimuth sent the Adamastor to retrive the survey team and their samples and take them to a secure facility in an undisclosed location in the direction of Barnard's Loop, but the Thargoid object they brought on board induced continuous malfunctions and something caused fighting to break out. Professor Carver abandoned the Adamastor in a Sidewinder MkI and crashed on HIP 69200 1 B. The remaining crew presumably also abandoned the ship at some point, as it engaged an automatic return course back to Chukchan, a journey which it did not complete until 3306 because of hyperdrive failure. From this information, it was surmised that like the Pleiades and the Witch Head Nebula, the Coalsack Nebula had been seeded by the Thargoids and claimed as their territory. The Adamastor incident became the earliest verified encounter with the Thargoids on record, taking place about 14 years before the start of the first Thargoid War in 3125.^[117]^^[118]^

In short order, the Alliance organised an expedition with corporate backing to the Coalsack Nebula to occupy it and exploit the newly-uncovered Thargoid Barnacles. The Adamastor's return had been fortuitous, as the Witch Head Nebula's sources of meta-alloys had begun to exhibit signs of over-exploitation and a recent invasion attempt by the Thargoids had sparked fears of a regional resurgence. It was also widely believed that Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon saw the Coalsack as a chance to shore up the Alliance's economy and improves his chances of reelection in 3307.^[119]^ The Alliance Assembly approved the expedition plan on 9 November and it began on 12 November with a public resource drive and military campaign to reduce the Coalsack's Thargoid presence. The Alliance Expeditionary Pact intended to develop four systems: Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 would gain the starport Betancourt Base, and the outposts Hannu Arena, Cole Point, and Bering Port would be built in Musca Dark Region IM-V c2-24, Coalsack Sector VU-O b6-6, and Coalsack Sector KN-S b4-9, respectively. The resource drive would allow the three outposts to be upgraded to starports, and also expand the range of services available at all four stations.^[120]^^[121]^ The new stations were opened on 26 November. In addition, Dr. Rodion Stathos, chief xenobiologist of Betancourt Base, issued an open request for deliveries of Thargoid commodities and offered higher than usual prices for them.^[122]^

The colonisation of the Coalsack precipitated a new technology with long-term ramifications for humans and Thargoids. On 3 December 3306, Dr. Maximilian North of Sirius Atmospherics, a subsidiary of Sirius Corporation, announced the development of new terraforming procedures tailored to Ammonia Worlds, which had previously been ignored as terraforming candidates. Although terraforming Ammonia Worlds would be a slow process, the news meant that worlds that only the Thargoids had held an interest in could one day be encroached on by humans.^[123]^^[124]^

#### Changing priorities and sporadic attacks

Meanwhile, tensions between the Federation and Empire neared the breaking point in late 3306 as a result of the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army terrorist group and a heated dispute over the fate of Imperial Marlinist refugees who had been granted asylum in Federal space. On 27 November 3306, as observers warned that the two superpowers stood on the brink of war, Senator Denton Patreus ordered the withdrawal of Imperial funding from Aegis as the Empire changed its focus from the seemingly subsiding Thargoid threat to countering the Federation and the NMLA.^[125]^ Minor factions were not as certain, however, and amid rising volatility in financial markets and concerns about a possible conflict between the superpowers, they focused on bolstering their defences. As a result, the value of Combat Bond Vouchers rose dramatically on December 8, and the value of bonds obtained by destroying Thargoid vessels quadrupled.^[126]^

The Federation also withdrew its own funding from Aegis. On 10 December, Commodore Morag Halloran of the Alliance Defence Force commented that the recently established Coalsack Nebula colonies were vulnerable to Thargoid attacks, as the ADF's response time would be slow due to the distance involved and Aegis had been impacted by the loss of Federal and Imperial funding.^[124]^ Meanwhile, Sirius Atmospherics had begun testing new terraforming techniques on Ammonia Worlds in the Coalsack, but according to project lead Dr. Maximilian North, the procedures were proving less effective than predicted. With Sirius Corporation personnel and equipment flooding the region at the same time, some observers such as independent journalist Flint Lafosse speculated that the terraforming project was cover for another Sirius operation involving the Thargoids that would end up provoking them.^[127]^

The Thargoids finally struck again on 31 December 3306, simultaneously launching incursions into nine systems, three in the Coalsack Nebula and six in the Witch Head Nebula. The Alliance Defence Force was, as feared, too slow to prevent the infestations, and local security forces reported being overwhelmed. Admiral Aden Tanner warned that Aegis could not adequately respond to the situation due to the recent funding and resource cutbacks, and called on independent pilots to provide assistance.^[128]^ Thousands of colonists were confirmed dead on 7 January 3307 as the offensive entered its second week, with only two of the nine affected systems cleared of Thargoid Incursions. Admiral Tanner reiterated that the nebula colonies had no other option but to rely on independent pilots for protection from the alien threat.^[129]^

In light of these latest attacks, as well as the terrorism, political tensions, and economic instability that had wracked the Core Systems in the latter half of 3306, on 1 January 3307, Simguru Pranav Antal of Utopia proposed a Galactic Summit between the three superpowers to resolve their differences.^[130]^ On 8 January, Professor Alba Tesreau urged the superpowers to attend the Galactic Summit and recommit to supporting Aegis in light of the Thargoid resurgence, stating that coexistence would only be possible with the Thargoids through greater understanding achieved through rigorous research. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon, Princess Aisling Duval, and Shadow President Felicia Winters all signalled their support for the conference, and it was reported the legislators in each superpower were pressuring their respective leaders to attend. Simguru Antal also confirmed that independent systems were welcome to participate, but emphasized that the Summit's primary purpose was to provide a neutral setting for the Federation, Empire, and Alliance to debate policies.^[131]^ Sirius Corporation voiced its support for the Galactic Summit, but then made its own play to host the conference in the Sirius system, which succeeded.^[132]^^[133]^

During the second week of the summit, Prime Minister Mahon proposed the Sirius Treaty, an agreement between the superpowers to greatly expand the remit of Aegis and increase international cooperation against the Thargoids.^[134]^ On March 9, following a broad agreement among the delegates to increase funding for Aegis in exchange for a promise of new breakthroughs in anti-Thargoid technology, the Sirius Treaty had gained the support of Archon Delaine of the Kumo Crew pirates, the Marlinist Colonies, and several other independent groups, leaving the Federation and the Empire as the only major holdouts.^[135]^ Unfortunately for the Sirius Treaty's prospects, the NMLA carried out its horrific Nine Martyrs terrorist attack on 11 March, bombing nine starports across the Core Systems. The Galactic Summit concluded early as delegations returned home to deal with the attack, and Mahon's proposal was left unsigned.^[136]^^[137]^

### The beginning of the end?

#### Aegis tarnished

 	 	[![Alexandria](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/bb/Alexandria.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20210525003446)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/bb/Alexandria.png/revision/latest?cb=20210525003446) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
The Alexandria
 		 	 

Aegis began making good on its Galactic Summit promise on 22 April, when Professor Tesreau unveiled a campaign to collect Guardian artefacts to research new anti-Thargoid defences. Aegis Research deployed a new megaship, Alexandria, in the Delphi system to host the initiative, and Professor Tesreau pledged access to Guardian Gauss Cannons from Technology Brokers as an extra incentive for participants. In addition, Alexandria temporarily contracted a Guardian Technology Broker, and offered to extend their contract for extra weeks depending on the initiative's success.^[138]^ The campaign met its goal by 29 April, and Professor Tesreau thanked contributors. As the research project entered its early stages, there were no signs of imminent breakthroughs.^[139]^

The Aegis appeal may have indirectly provoked the Thargoids, however, as on 13 May 3307, countless Thargoid ships swarmed into ten systems: Atlas, Celaeno, Coalsack Sector KN-S b4-9, Coalsack Sector VU-O b6-6, HIP 18390, HIP 62154, HR 1183, Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1, Pleiades Sector HR-W d1-74, and Delphi itself. Local starports were heavily damaged, and Aegis mobilised its available defences and called for volunteers. Professor Tesreau surmised that the high concentration of Guardian artefacts delivered to Delphi may have set off the Thargoids' deeply instilled aversion to Guardian technology. Two of the damaged stations, California Freeport and Fort Xeno, had been recently constructed through the efforts of the Kumo Crew, and Pirate King Archon Delaine swore to take revenge.^[140]^ Also of note, the attack on California Freeport in HIP 18390 marked the first time the Thargoids had attacked a human colony in the California Nebula; while the California Nebula had multiple identified Thargoid Barnacle sites, no Thargoid craft had previously been encountered in the region. By 20 May, only two of the Incursions had been defeated. That same day, the Alexandria embarked on a journey to Sol and jumped from Delphi to HIP 16538, where it planned to restock tritium. The Thargoids followed, trapping the Alexandria in the system and endangering the local civilians. Admiral Aden Tanner requested volunteers to come to the megaship's aid before its important cargo of Guardian artefacts was lost.^[141]^ On 24 May, the Federal Navy barred the Alexandria from entering any Federal system over fears that it would bring Thargoids and cause more incursions. Wishing to avoid jettisoning the ship's important cargo, it was decided that as soon the incursion in HIP 16538 had been cleared, the Alexandria would jump a system with a minimal population to offload the Guardian artefacts.^[142]^

Meanwhile, another kind of disaster involving the starports the Thargoids had damaged was narrowly avoided. The Oracle in Delphi was the first damaged starport to report that a cascading systems failure caused by the Thargoid attack had shut down its alignment thrusters, leaving it unable to sustain its orbit. As The Oracle began to plummet toward the surface of Delphi 5 A, it was determined that there was not enough time to fully evacuate the station before impact. Independent pilots worked around the clock to continue evacuating station inhabitants regardless, and fortunately, station engineers managed to reactivate the alignment thrusters and restore The Oracle to a stable orbit. Other starports facing similar crises were also saved. Authorities began working to address the design vulnerability that caused the problem, as it was speculated that it was the result of a dangerous new Thargoid tactic rather than a coincidence.^[143]^

HIP 16538 was cleared of Thargoids by 27 May. On 1 June, the Alexandria's captain, Jacob Morales, announced plans to jump the megaship to the HIP 30944 system on 3 June, where the Guardian artefacts would be offloaded and distributed to multiple locations. Anticipating that the Alexandria could come under direct attack from the Thargoids, Captain Morales asked all independent pilots aboard the megaship to depart before the jump was set to take place, and warned that any private ships still docked immediately prior to the jump would be jettisoned.^[144]^ The Alexandria departed as scheduled, but never arrived in HIP 30944. Search teams found no trace of it in nearby systems. On 4 June, Admiral Aden Tanner declared the megaship to be missing, with Captain Morales and his crew of four thousand classified as missing presumed dead. Tanner posited that the Alexandria had been hyperdicted by the Thargoids. The loss of the Alexandria's cargo also dealt a severe blow to Aegis's Guardian technology research project.^[145]^

Aegis Under Investigation
 		 	 

The superpowers ordered the partial suspension of Aegis and launched an investigation into the Alexandria's disappearance on 27 July 3307. The move came as public confidence in Aegis had been irreparably damaged in the wake of the Alexandria incident and the group's defeat by the mysterious Salvation, whom some authorities suspected was the leader of an Aegis splinter group, in a campaign to secure access to a newly-discovered Guardian-Thargoid War battlefield in Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2, the site of the Proteus. Many of Aegis's operations were shut down for the investigation, and several senior members including Professor Alba Tesreau were forced to resign.^[146]^ The initial phase of the independent inquiry, which was headed by Dr. Paul Baumann, was underway by 11 August 3307, and involved an examination of Aegis's work and leadership decisions, as well as an analysis of the Alexandria, its crew, and the circumstances of the megaship's disappearance.^[147]^

Thargoid Strike Follows Salvation's Prediction
 		 	 

On 14 September 3307, Salvation announced that he was developing a new interstellar xeno-detection network that he claimed would surpass the capabilities of Eagle Eye, and revealed preliminary readings from this network indicated that the Cornsar system would soon be attacked by the Thargoids. Salvation's warning was dismissed by Carter Armstrong of Aegis, as well as the leader of Cornsar's ruling faction, Marshal Noah Sharrow, who declined to order an evacuation.^[148]^ Consequently, when the Thargoids proved Salvation's prediction correct by attacking Chadwick Port and Ito Market in Cornsar on 16 September, the casualties numbered over ten thousand, and millions more were threatened by the presence of Thargoid ships. Marshal Sharrow issued a call for aid, while Aegis was unable to provide any support due to its ongoing suspension. Salvation did not comment on the attack despite being vindicated.^[149]^ On 17 September, however, Salvation secretly contacted his supporters and asked them to rendezvous with the Heart of Taurus, a megaship operated by Taurus Mining Ventures that carried shipments of advanced technical components falsely registered as Basic Medicines. Pilots were directed to deliver the shipments to the Rescue Vessels in Cornsar, where they would be assembled into a prototype anti-xeno superweapon. This weapon was apparently successfully activated on 20 September, when the Thargoid fleet suddenly withdrew from the system and numerous crashed Thargoid ships were subsequently sighted on several local worlds.^[150]^ Salvation took credit for repelling the Thargoids on 22 September, and confirmed that pilots who supported his project would be granted permits to the Mbooni system on 23 September to receive their reward, a modified Guardian Gauss Cannon.^[151]^

#### Fallout from the Cornsar incident

The Thargoids invaded the Pleiades Nebula and Witch Head Nebula on 28 October 3307. The systems Asterope, Evangelis, Haki, Lembass, Onoros, Pleiades Sector PD-S b4-0, Shenve, and Wellington were overwhelmed, and thousands of casualties were reported. Admiral Aden Tanner of Aegis expressed frustration that Aegis could not provide more assistance due to the Baumann investigation. Tanner also voiced his concern that Salvation's anti-xeno weapon was to blame for the invasion, asserting that its use in Cornsar had provoked the Thargoids and could escalate the war. Taurus Mining Ventures moved the Bright Sentinel megaship from Mbooni to Merope at Salvation's request to give pilots access to its Technology Broker.^[152]^ As the offensive entered its second week and expanded into the HR 1183 system, Admiral Tanner took action. On 5 November 3307, Tanner broadcast that he had taken command of the Aegis Defense megaship Musashi and moved it to T Tauri to conduct a search of Taurus Mining Ventures' headquarters, Hind Mine. Tanner believed that Salvation was using his anti-xeno weapon to deliberately and recklessly provoke the Thargoids, and claimed to have sources who had confirmed that Hind Mine contained evidence of Salvation's misdeeds. Taurus Mining Ventures spokesperson Patience Middleton insisted her company's contracts with Salvation were legal and confidential. Other Aegis leaders condemned Tanner for relocating the Musashi without authorisation and ordered him to depart T Tauri.^[153]^

On 11 November, at the start of the third week of the Thargoid offensive, Thargoid forces were completely expelled from Asterope, but the other affected systems remained under siege, and five new incursions were reported in Celaeno, Coalsack Sector KN-S b4-9, Coalsack Sector VU-O b6-6, HIP 62154, and Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1. Also that day, Admiral Tanner acted on his own authority and launched an attack on the forces of Taurus Mining Ventures in T Tauri to gain access to Hind Mine and expose Salvation's secrets. Although Tanner was now openly defying Aegis leadership's orders to leave T Tauri, it was rumoured that many Aegis members quietly supported his actions and shared his view that the ongoing Baumann investigation should end. Patience Middleton issued a call for aid in defending against Tanner's illegal attack and protecting Salvation's work.^[154]^ The battle ended in a bitter defeat for Tanner on 18 November. Taurus Mining Ventures forces boarded and captured the Musashi, and Tanner himself was detained pending his transfer to Aegis's internal security teams. The Musashi's other Aegis Defense personnel were permitted to leave the megaship unharmed.^[155]^ That same day, the Thargoids attacked three more systems: Electra, HIP 16753, and Taygeta, bringing the total number of systems experiencing active incursions to 16. By week five, human resistance efforts pushed the Thargoids out of Celaeno and HR 1183, but the Thargoids countered with new incursions in Pleiades Sector DL-Y d65, Pleiades Sector HR-W d1-74, and Pleiades Sector IH-V c2-7.

The Federal Navy announced on 29 November that Admiral Tanner would be court-martialed for his actions in T Tauri, and if found guilty he would be dishonourably discharged and imprisoned for life. The Aegis members who had crewed the Musashi under Tanner's command had similarly been repatriated to their home systems to face civil or military charges. Dr. Paul Baumann commented that the T Tauri incident would also be factored into his inquiry's final report on potential misconduct by Aegis. It was also observed that although there was no direct evidence to support Tanner's claims that Salvation was deliberately provoking the Thargoids, coordinated strikes by Thargoid forces continued to affect multiple systems.^[156]^ On November 30, freelance war correspondent Ernesto Rios reported for Vox Galactica that independent pilots were experiencing unusually strong resistance from the Thargoids, and the invaders' fleets were receiving a constant stream of reinforcements. With the Cornsar incident still fresh in the public consciousness, the Imperial Navy and the Alliance's Council of Admirals had begun discussing the possibility of providing military support to Salvation, and Federal Congress had debated redirecting funds set aside for Aegis to Salvation to hasten the development of his anti-xeno weapon. With neither Aegis nor Salvation providing direct support in active Thargoid conflict zones, however, the burden of protecting human colonies fell largely to independent pilots.^[157]^

#### Operation Tri-hammer

Salvation arranged for the Taurus Mining Ventures megaships Bright Sentinel, Glorious Prospect, and Musashi to jump to the Maia, Merope, and Delphi systems on 9 December to support the assembly and activation of three more anti-xeno superweapons to repel Thargoids from those systems. Independent pilots were asked to deliver shipments of Classified Experimental Equipment from the Heart of Taurus in Qarato to the three other megaships by December 14. Among those directing the three initiatives were various former members of the Federation, Empire, and Alliance, such as Commodore Morag Halloran, who had resigned their commissions to assist Salvation as they believed he was humanity's only hope of defeating the Thargoids.^[158]^ At the same time, former senior Aegis member Professor Alba Tesreau quietly contacted Aegis supporters and visitors to the Meene system, asking them to divert shipments of Classified Experimental Equipment to Felice Dock for the Engineer Ram Tah to analyse.

"Operation Tri-hammer", as Salvation's allies referred to the initiative internally, activated the superweapons as planned in 14 December, destroying a large number of Thargoid vessels and causing the survivors to flee from all three systems. Independent observers confirmed the results and noted the similarities to the Cornsar incident. Suspiciously, a message intercepted from Commodore Halloran indicated that part of the operation entailed scanning the systems after the weapons' activation for *"non-combatant disruption or casualties"*.^[159]^ Salvation issued a statement to all newsfeeds on December 15 confirming the success of his weapons and revealing that while he was unable to deploy them in other war-torn systems, in 3308 he would be ready to *"deliver a decisive blow"* against the Thargoids. Declaring that Aegis was *"finished"* and he was the only remaining hope for humanity, Salvation urged the galactic community to unite behind his *"crusade"*.^[160]^ An update on the status of the Thargoid conflict provided by Ernesto Rios on 21 December confirmed that while some progress was finally being made in turning the Thargoids back in the wake of Operation Tri-hammer, reinforcements continued to pour into the Coalsack, Pleiades, and Witch Head nebulae. An anxious public demanded to know why more superweapons were not being deployed immediately, but with Salvation having gone dark once again, the scientist's supporters could only speculate that Salvation needed more time to build up stockpiles of components, or that he was focused on a grander strategy that would end the Thargoid threat in a single stroke.^[161]^

On 5 January 3308, Ram Tah testified on behalf of Admiral Aden Tanner at his court martial for the T Tauri incident. According to his analysis of the Classified Experimental Equipment used in Salvation's anti-xeno superweapon, the technology was Guardian in origin, and likely related to new devices found at the Proteus site months earlier. He hypothesized that the superweapon was an up-scaled Guardian weapon design that emitted electromagnetic pulses at a specific frequency that disrupted the bio-mechanics of Thargoid vessels. The superweapon's use of Guardian technology also provoked the Thargoids into attacking star systems where the devices were present in overwhelming numbers. The Federal Navy Criminal Court suspended Tanner's trial while this new evidence was reviewed.^[162]^ This development failed to rescue Tanner from disgrace, however, as a week later on 12 January, he was found guilty and given a dishonourable discharge from the Federal Navy. Tanner's sentencing hearing was postponed at the request of Fleet Admiral Tayo Maikori, the newly-promoted head of the Federal Navy, who ordered a full review of Ram Tah's findings.^[163]^

#### ADF and Sirius Navy unite

Growing uncertainty about the Thargoid conflict pushed Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and the Alliance Assembly to invite Sirius Corporation CEO Li Yong-Rui to Alioth on 22 December to discuss a strategic defence agreement to bolster the Alliance Defence Force against the Thargoids.^[164]^ Talks between the superpower and the megacorp culiminated in the signing of a strategic defence pact on 3 January 3308, in which Sirius Corp would support the ADF in anti-xeno operations in exchange for certain undisclosed financial opportunities. The measure was approved in a rare, closed-door, joint vote of the Assembly and the Council of Admirals. The exact terms of the pact were also classified, and opponents of the pact such as Councilor Nakato Kaine criticised the lack of transparency.^[165]^

The defence pact went into effect on 10 January. Admiral Nikolas Glass of the Sirius Navy joined the Alliance's Council of Admirals as its seventh member, the first time in Alliance history that the Council had more than six seats as well as the first time a seat was granted to a non-Alliance military leader. Glass was a highly-decorated officer, and his purview on the Council was to coordinate the ADF's anti-Thargoid operations. The Council's expansion was endorsed by Prime Minister Mahon and Fleet Admiral Hayley Sorokin, who noted that the ADF was smaller than the navies of the Federation and Empire and in need of the added firepower that Sirius Corporation could provide. Councillor Kaine repeated her opposition to the pact, and Admiral George Varma also spoke out against *"merging commercial interests with military matters"*. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran further stoked controversy over the pact when she admitted that she had abstained from the January 3rd vote, but she refused to explain her decision.^[166]^

Sirius Corp's integration with the Alliance took another step forward on 14 January 3308, with Mahon granting permission for the megacorporation to establish a presence in Alliance space. Four Sirius megaships arrived in Alioth, Arimpox, Di Jian, and Reorte, and Sirius advisors officially joined the ADF and multiple government departments to streamline ADF and Sirius Navy joint operations. This provoked fresh disapproval from Councillor Kaine, who argued that Mahon's executive action was illegal and Assembly approval was needed to invite Sirius Corp into Alliance systems. Kaine also complained that Mahon's decision could not be reversed in court as it was tied to the defence pact and thus protected as a classified military matter.^[167]^

#### The dismantling of Aegis

The Alliance, Empire, and Federation announced on 18 January 3308 that per the recommendation of the Baumann Report, Aegis would be shut down. Responsibility for anti-Thargoid military operations would devolve to the Federal Navy, Imperial Navy, Alliance Defence Force, and Sirius Navy, each acting independently to defend the territory of their respective superpower, and Aegis's xenological research would be continued by specialist departments of the Holloway Bioscience Institute, Imperial Science Academy, and Olympus Village University. While the shutdown of Aegis took effect immediately, complete demobilisation of Aegis's personnel and assets was expected to take several more months.^[168]^ A request by Aegis to be reinstated in light of revelations that Azimuth Biochemicals was responsible for the Alexandria's disappearance was denied on 7 February. By this point, the consensus among politicians was that Aegis had failed to adequately defend human territory from the Thargoids and did not warrant a second chance.^[169]^

Another wave of Thargoid incursions that began on 11 February 3308 in Dan, HIP 12314, and Nauni on the fringe of the Core Systems proved serious enough that a number of Aegis support megaships that had not yet been decommissioned were pressed back into service to provide emergency aid. The superpowers were organising new anti-xeno taskforces to replace Aegis, but it was too early to send them into action. Some observers feared that these latest attacks were retaliation for Salvation's use of anti-xeno superweapons in the Pleiades Nebula.^[170]^ Independent pilots led the bulk of defence operations in the systems. By February 18, not only were the superpowers' taskforces still not ready, but Salvation had also chosen to avoid involvement and was prioritising the refinement of the anti-xeno superweapon. Independent journalist Flint "Firemaker" Lafosse speculated that the superpowers were so caught up in internal crises, specifically the Alliance's defence pact with Sirius Corporation, Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval's kidnapping by the Lords of Restoration, and President Zachary Hudson's controversial push to repeal presidential term limits, that they were content to leave the Thargoid problem entirely to Salvation.^[171]^ The Dan, HIP 12314, and Nauni attacks prompted Aegis to submit a second request to be reinstated on 2 March 3308, with Chief Administrator Carter Armstrong making the case that the superpowers were distracted by internal situations and Aegis could provide a united front to counter both the Thargoids and Azimuth Biochemicals.^[172]^ The next day, 3 March, the Thargoids invaded the Gabia and Malanges systems.

### End of the war

The Second Thargoid War ended when AX pilots repelled the Thargoid fleet invasion and the destruction of the Titan Cocijo on 18 December 3010.^[173]^ However, the Thargoids still inhabit the California Nebula, Coalsack Nebula, Pleiades Nebula and the Witch Head Nebula.^[174]^

## Aftermath

### Impact

The total impact of the Second Thargoid War is difficult to calculate. Tens of billions perished, and several thousand Thargoid vessels were destroyed on a weekly basis. Exact numbers are difficult to determine, but on 16 December 3305, it was reported that at least 4,788,600 Thargoids had been eliminated since the conflict began.^[2]^ When the 8 Maelstroms arrived, the Thargoid fleets overwhelmed 44 populated systems.^[175]^ Settlements and starports in dozens of neighboring regions were also attacked by the fleets.^[175]^ Billions were killed and billions more refugees fled which caused the biggest humanitarian crisis in history.^[175]^

While the Thargoids have attacked multiple human Starports, they have only gone so far as to cripple those stations rather than destroy them outright, a decision which has resulted in fewer human civilian casualties and allowed the stations to be fully repaired in a matter of weeks or months. The station attacks and skirmishes between human and Thargoid vessels have thus far done little to depress human commerce and the international economy; in fact, the pursuit of versatile Meta-Alloys has encouraged human expansion directly into peripheral Thargoid territories, specifically the California Nebula, Witch Head Nebula, and Coalsack Nebula, to exploit Thargoid Barnacles for economic gain. It is currently impossible to measure the impact of the war on the Thargoids themselves due to the lack of communication and access to their main territory.
