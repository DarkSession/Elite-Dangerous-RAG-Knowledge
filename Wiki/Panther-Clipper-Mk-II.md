## Elite II

The Panther Clipper Mk II's predecessor, the Panther Clipper, first appeared in *Frontier: Elite II*. It was the largest ship in the game, being extremely slow as a consequence, and was described as capable of buying entire planets out of their cargo. Due to its immense size, it was capable of being equipped with planetary bombardment-class weaponry and powerful shields that shrugged off attacks from small pirate craft.
