**Canopus** is a Federal system outside the Core Systems in the Inner Orion Spur. It and its neighbor Exphiay are a pair of remote colonies that were settled by the corporation Gallant Investment Brokers. Despite the relative isolation and tiny population of Canopus, some of its residents are among the thousands of travelers who journey to the Starport M. Gorbachev in Sol every year to commemorate the historic flight of Yuri Gagarin, the first human launched into space.^[1]^
