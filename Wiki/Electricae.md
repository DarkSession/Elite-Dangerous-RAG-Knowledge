Electricae Radialem
 		 	 

> 
> 
> Organisms found exclusively on extremely cold ice worlds in the vicinity of frozen lakes. The visible tips can be observed protruding from the ice, often near fissures where it is thinnest. The bulk of the organisms extend down through the ice into subsurface melt, potentially for several kilometres. Electricae are superconductive in nature, utilising the thermal circulation of the surrounding fluid to drive an electrochemical process. This is probably why they are limited to planets with atmospheres dominated by noble gases. The surface structure exists to provide a connection point to the atmosphere, which in turn creates a point of potential electrical difference. A by-product of this is the bioluminescent display that runs through the organism. Although never witnessed, reproduction presumably occurs below the surface by some unidentified process.

**Electricae** is a genus of alien organism found on planets and moons with thin atmospheres across the galaxy. They can be sampled with the Genetic Sampler and scanned with the Short Range Composition Scanner.

### Description

*A species of electricae that extends a tip of four connected loops above the ice, each covered with brightly luminous fronds. This species is typically found on planets orbiting bright white stars.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planet with thin Helium, Neon or Argon atmosphere
- Icy planets
- Parent star of type A, with a luminosity class of V or more, Neutron star or White dwarf. To be confirmed: type O, B, black hole.
- Maximum gravity: 0.27

### Colored variants

Colored variant determined by rare material found on planet:

| MATERIAL | COLOR |
| --- | --- |
| Antinomy | Cobalt |
| Polonium | Cyan |
| Ruthenium | Blue |
| Technetium | Magenta |
| Tellurium | Red |
| Yttrium | Mulberry |

Electricae Radialem
 		 	 

### Description

*These electricae species protrude bioluminescent stalks that radiate out in all directions. It is thought that this species may have an unspecified link with the proximity of nebulae to its host planet.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planet with thin Helium, Neon or Argon atmosphere
- Icy planets
- Close to Nebulae
- Maximum gravity: 0.27

### Colored variants

Colored variant determined by rare material found on planet:

| MATERIAL | COLOR |
| --- | --- |
| Antinomy | Cyan |
| Polonium | Cobalt |
| Ruthenium | Blue |
| Technetium | Aquamarine |
| Tellurium | Magenta |
| Yttrium | Green |
