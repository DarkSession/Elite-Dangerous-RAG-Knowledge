## High Grade Emissions

### Type

Spontaneous

### Threat Level(s)

0

### Activities

Salvage

**High Grade Emissions** are a type of signal source where certain Rare and Very Rare Manufactured Materials can be obtained. They are empty aside from the free-floating materials and occasionally a single, non-hostile ship that will eventually depart.

## Signal Contents

High Grade Emissions will generate certain very rare manufactured materials, depending on individual Faction States and the allegience of the controlling faction:

- Federal systems:
    - Core Dynamics Composites
    - Proprietary Composites
- Imperial systems:
    - Imperial Shielding
- Civil Unrest faction states:
    - Improvised Components
- War or Civil War faction states:
    - Military Grade Alloys
    - Military Supercapacitors
- Outbreak faction states and population &gt; 1,000,000:
    - Pharmaceutical Isolators
- Boom or Expansion faction states:
    - Proto Heat Radiators
    - Proto Light Alloys
    - Proto Radiolic Alloys

For systems that exhibit more than one condition listed above, the materials spawned will be randomly chosen from the list of applicable materials.

## Spawn Locations

High Grade Emissions usually appear in deep space or occasionally in spheres of influence.  Scanning a system's Nav Beacon can cause High Grade Emissions to appear if none are already present.

They are most common in high population systems (1 million or more).

## Notes

In Federal and Imperial systems, any High Grade Emissions present will have their status as "N/A" or "Civil Liberty".
