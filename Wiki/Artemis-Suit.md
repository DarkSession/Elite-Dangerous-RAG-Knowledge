## Overview

The Artemis Suit is purpose-built for exobiology and is the only suit model that can use the Genetic Sampler, an essential tool in that profession. Although less durable than the Dominator Suit, and less useful in scavenging and looting than the Maverick Suit, the Artemis Suit can be equipped with a primary weapon, providing it with a moderate defensive or even offensive capability should exploration activities be suddenly interrupted by combat situations. It also possesses the best jetpack of all existing suit models. Engineering modifications can be installed to bolster the suit's combat capabilities if desired, or used to increase its scientific utility if the wearer does not anticipate hostile encounters.
