# Focused Weapon
**Focused Weapon** is an engineer modification that can be applied to weapons. It increases overall range and armour piercing damage, at the cost of decreased rate of fire and increased thermal load.

It is available in 5 grades, with the highest grade offering up to 100% increase in range and up to 60% increase in armour piercing damage.

Applying this modification will also allow an Experimental Effect to be applied.
