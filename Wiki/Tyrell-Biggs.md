Former President of the Federation

**Tyrell Biggs** served as the President of the Federation from 3008 to 3016.^[1]^

Prior to his election to the presidency, Biggs had been Congressman for Mars for a long time, and made extensive use of his diplomatic connections throughout his tenure. During his election, he talked a great deal about the use of diplomacy rather than force.

In 3008, during a lull in the fighting in Alioth, Biggs had Federal diplomats secretly approach the Imperial court with a proposition that Achenar and its subsidiary systems join the Federation as full members. This had been attempted before, and had been met with Imperial derision each time. This latest proposition included clauses and amendments that would have allowed Imperial systems to qualify for membership despite the differences between Federal and Imperial law on several matters. However, the leak of the proposal documents by Federal spies to other Imperial systems caused widespread unrest, which might have been Biggs' intention all along. For the next decade, Federal-Imperial relations cooled and distrust grew on both sides.^[2]^
