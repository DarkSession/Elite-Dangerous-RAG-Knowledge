**Power Tracker Malware** is a type of Data in *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*. It can be obtained from Power contacts in any Fortified or Stronghold systems controlled by a commander's Power and used at settlement Data Ports in Undermining systems. 

A single upload can be performed on each data port within a settlement per instance, taking 60 seconds and rewarding 300 merits upon completion.

They are considered illegal items, and NPC personnel will react negatively if they detect the player holding or using one.
