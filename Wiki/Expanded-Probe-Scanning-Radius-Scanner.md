# Expanded Probe Scanning Radius Scanner
**Expanded Probe Scanning Radius Scanner** is an Engineer modification that can be applied to Detailed Surface Scanners. It increases the scanning radius of all probes launched by the DSS, enabling a full surface scan to require fewer probes and making it easier to meet the efficiency target, which does not change based on scan radius. This modification has no negative effects.

It is available in 5 grades, with the highest grade offering up to 50% increase in probe scanning radius.
