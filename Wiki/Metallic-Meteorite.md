**Metallic Meteorites** are a source of Raw Materials. 

## Location

They can be found on planets especially with craters. They are detectable with the SRV's Wave Scanner, represented as two fuzzy bars near the bottom of the readout. 

When they are destroyed by weapons fire from a ship or SRV, they'll explode into chunks of Materials. These can be collected with the Cargo Scoop of a ship or SRV. Metallic Meteorites are a decent source of rare and very rare materials while surface prospecting.
