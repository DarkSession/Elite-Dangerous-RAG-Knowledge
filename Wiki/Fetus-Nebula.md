The **Fetus Nebula**, also known as NGC 7008, is a nebula in the Inner Orion Spur. It lies 360 LYs above the Elephant's Trunk Nebula. It is difficult to notice on the Galactic Map. Centered on the star Lan 111, it stretches only one Light Year across the sky. From the vantage point of its nearest neighbor, it looks like a bright blue beacon in the sky.
