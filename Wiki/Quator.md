> A lawless backwater, despite the efforts of Wreaken Construction and Mining. The Furnace battle group from Alioth under the command of Admiral Bryce Jander were based here before they journeyed to Lave to take part in the famous 'Battle of Lave Station' in 3265. Quator remains a haven for pirates. 'Hoopy's Bar' on Quator Station should not be confused with the popular casino chain of the 3200s.

**Quator** is a Federal system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It is one of the Old Worlds. In October 3305, a tri-superpower taskforce investigating a devastating crop blight traced the origins of the disease to an extremist group called the Scythe of Panem, which had established itself in Quator. When members of the Scythe responded to their discovery with unprovoked violence and endangered civilians, a campaign was organized to neutralize them. The Scythe of Panem's leaders were eliminated, multiple members were arrested, and the group was effectively dismantled, although remnants persist.
