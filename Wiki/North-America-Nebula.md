Right next door to the Pelican Nebula, lies the **North America Nebula**. The North America nebula stretches over 100LY at [1,894:-34:140] and is made from the same super heated hydrogen gas cloud. From Sol it is shaped like the Earth continent North America, but up close the size loses definition.
