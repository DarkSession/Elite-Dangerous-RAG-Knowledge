Heart and Soul Nebulae
 		 	 

The **Heart and Soul Nebulae** are a pair of nebulae in Elysian Shore. The Heart Nebula is lit by the Melotte 15 cluster at its core and stretches for over 30 light years. The Soul Nebula, about 330 LY away is less diffused than its neighbor. Together, both nebulae are considered a gateway that leads to the Formidine Rift.
