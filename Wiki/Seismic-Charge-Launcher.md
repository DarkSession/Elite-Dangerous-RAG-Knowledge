The **Seismic Charge Launcher** is a hardpoint module used in mining. It uses specialized munitions called seismic charge warheads, which can be fired into Fissures on certain asteroids. A Prospector Limpet is required for the Seismic Charge Launcher to function, and a Refinery is required for material excavated with the module.

## Usage

Destructible "motherlode" asteroids bear Fissures in which Seismic Charge Launcher warheads can be embedded and detonated in order to break the asteroid open. Locating motherlode asteroids is possible by memorizing the shapes and sizes of the three variants, but bringing the proper equipment makes the process considerably easier. The Pulse Wave Analyser utility highlights resource-bearing asteroids, and reacts strongly to motherlode asteroids. Having Night Vision active can help the Pulse Wave Analyser's pulse stand out in low-light areas of planetary rings. Prospector Limpets can be used to confirm that an asteroid contains a certain resource and enable the Fissures to be targeted.

Detonating Seismic Charge warheads
 		 	 

A Seismic Charge Launcer warhead's strength is determined by the user at the time it is launched. Holding down the trigger will allow the warhead to gradually charge up. The user can release the trigger to launch the warhead when it reaches the desired level of strength, which is indicated by the bars on the left side of the aiming reticule. Upon successfully embedding in a Fissure, a warhead will automatically begin a 120 second countdown to detonation, during which time additional warheads can be planted in other Fissures; subsequent warheads will sync up with the first warhead for a simultaneous detonation. If a sufficient number of warheads are planted on the asteroid, then detonation will break the asteroid apart into shards and expose new mineral deposits. Too few warheads will fail to shatter the asteroid, and too many will destroy some of the mineral deposits. Armed warheads can be manually disarmed or detonated early via the Contacts panel. Warheads that do not embed in a Fissure will bounce off and detonate harmlessly without causing any other warheads to detonate.^[1]^

Successful asteroid cracking and shockwave
 		 	 

Detonating warheads can pose a serious danger to the pilot's ship. At close-range, synced exploding warheads and the shockwave that results from a successful cracking of an asteroid can inflict severe damage to a ship's shields and hull. Within a 2-kilometer radius, the shockwave will cause temporary sensor and HUD disruption. It is recommended to retreat beyond a 2-kilometer radius before the warheads detonate in order to avoid all effects of the blast.

## Specifications

> 
> 
> Complex warheads that, when shot into asteroid fissures, will attach and activate a count down to detonation. When the timer hits zero, a destructive shock wave will be fired out, breaking down the fissure's structural integrity and potentially cracking an asteroid apart. Any further warheads activated during the countdown will sync with the first and detonate simultaneously. The trigger can be held to increase the power of the explosive charge. A refinery module is required to process asteroid chunks into saleable commodities. Only functions in analysis mode.
