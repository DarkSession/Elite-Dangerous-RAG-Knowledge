Beam Laser engineered with Regeneration Sequence

Support is an informal career in which one player aids another by refueling their ship or repairing its hull. This can be accomplished with Fuel Transfer Limpets for refuels, Repair Limpets for hull repairs and Beam Lasers engineered with Regeneration Sequence to restore shields. While this career does not guarantee any monetary reward, it can be an interesting and entertaining pursuit on its own. Many explorers often find themselves in need of fuel or repairs while wandering the far reaches of the galaxy, and combat ships can benefit from hull repairs both during and after a battle. 

Various player groups are dedicated to supporting other commanders, including the Fuel Rats. In AX Conflict zones you can support people with Decontamination limpets to remove caustic chemicals off a ship's hull.
