### Purpose

Promote colonization of the Colonia Region

### Established

December 3302

### Dissolved

May 3303

The **Colonia Expansion Initiative (CEI)** was an organization under the purview of the Colonia Council that promoted the colonization of the Colonia Region and helped citizens of the core systems emigrate there. Ever since Jaques Station arrived in Eol Prou RS-T d3-94, now known as Colonia, in June 3302, thousands of galactic citizens migrated to the system in search of a new way of life away from the conflicts of the Federation, Empire, and Alliance. The CEI constructed dozens of new Planetary Outposts in systems throughout the Colonia Region between December 3302 and May 3303, when it ceased operations as demand for Colonia colonies reached saturation.

## Timeline

01 DEC 3302

- Ever since Jaques Station arrived in Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 in June, thousands of galactic citizens have migrated to the system in search of a new way of life. The migration movement has resulted in a number of new outposts in the region, as well as a chain of stations connecting the burgeoning community with the core systems. With the colony now firmly established in Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 – recently renamed Colonia – the system's governing body, the Colonia Council, has announced plans to colonise the surrounding systems. In keeping with the spirit of egalitarianism that has characterised the colonisation movement, the Council has announced plans to run a series of appeals that will determine which organisations will occupy the systems surrounding Colonia. In a statement, a spokesperson for the organisation said: "With the help of the galactic community, we have been able to establish a secure presence in the Colonia system. Now it's time to open up the rest of the sector for colonisation. It is very important that those coming to the Colonia Nebula be committed to the area's ongoing development. That's why we're asking organisations that want to join the Colonia community to demonstrate their dedication by contributing to a resource drive. At the start of each month, we will announce which systems have been targeted for colonisation. To earn a migration visa, pilots must deliver a specific commodity to Jaques Station on behalf of their chosen organisation. The nature of the commodity will be specified at the start of the month. Naturally, pilots will be reimbursed for their efforts. At the end of the month, the ten factions that have made the largest contribution will earn the right to settle in one of the specified systems. A new planetary outpost will be constructed in the system for the organisation's sole use. We should point out that organisations settling in the Colonia Nebula will be considered independent entities, separate from their parent faction. Furthermore, the successful organisations will be responsible for working with other like-minded organisations to make the Colonia Nebula a beacon of civilisation." The first campaign begins on the 1st of December 3302 and will run for four weeks. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.^[1]^

## Notes

- Player-faction bases established in the Colonia Region through the CEI initially lacked shipyard facilities, which meant that no ships could be purchased, sold, or transferred at those bases. On June 18, 2018, Frontier Developments added shipyards to them in response to player feedback at Lavecon 2018.^[2]^^[3]^
