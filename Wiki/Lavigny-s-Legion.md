**Lavigny's Legion** is the largest^[1]^ Empire player group loyal to Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval. It is the private guard of the Lavigny family and the 528th Legion of the Imperial Navy, commanded by Admiral Lucius Lavigny.^[2]^ Lavigny's Legion was forged in the fiery crucible of Achenar’s first conflict with the Federation during the 2320s.^[3]^

Though technically a decommissioned entity, Lavigny's Legion has become a functional fleet with the Lavigny family's rise to power within the Imperial Senate. Initially only consisting of Imperial citizens with ties to the Lavigny family, the Legion begun recruiting Imperial citizens from external allegiances in the light of the events surrounding Emperor Hengist Duval's assassination.^[4]^

Lavigny's Legion's thousand-year history has resulted in a consistently growing following of their government, which promotes the ideals of Imperial Patronage. Initially only ruling over less than 70,000 citizens, the Legion is the governing body of twenty-four billion citizens spread across thirty four star systems, making them the dominant government of citizens in Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval territory, and the second largest Imperial faction by population overall.^[5]^ The governance itself is coordinated heavily by Governor Milo Peck, Overseer Alvaro Peters, and Client Rich Perry, all of whom are notable for issuing public contracts for pilots across Legion territories.
