Cactoida Pullulanta
 		 	 

> 
> 
> Photosynthetic organisms that have adapted to extreme conditions by reducing their surface area to volume ratio, thereby protecting more sensitive tissues from exposure. The outer layer is formed from specialised light-transmitting cells. These are filled with an insulating hydrophobic layer, which helps to maintain core temperature and liquid retention. Deep, extensive root structures hold the organisms in place, and facilitate the extraction of trace minerals. Some cactoida species feature explosive seed distribution as a method of reproduction.

## Distance

They have a clonal colony range of 300 m (between 2 genetic samples).

## Description

Cactoida are named after their resemblence to cacti. They appear on rocky hills and appear as small, round, pebble-like things from afar.^[1]^

## Conditions of occurrence

- Planets with thin Carbon dioxide, Ammonia or Water atmosphere
- Because of atmospheres types: only on Rocky or High Metal Content planets
- Maximum gravity: 0.27

## Cactoida cortexum

*CMDR Jojo Lou, Cactoida cortexum, Smojooe IT-P b19-5, CDE 3*
 		 	 

### Description

*A species of cactoid that can reach over three metres in height. They are composed of multiple growths that sprout sealed pods at their peaks, which open up to distribute seeds.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planets with thin Carbon Dioxide atmosphere
- Maximum gravity: 0.27
- Mean temperature between 180 K and 195 K

## Cactoida lapis

 	 	[![Cactoida Lapis - Amethyst](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/2/24/Cactoida_Lapis_-_Amethyst.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20211110152553)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/2/24/Cactoida_Lapis_-_Amethyst.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20211110152553) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Cactoida Lapis - Amethyst
 		 	 

### Description

*This cactoid species appears as a squat growth with a latficecl upper surface, which eventually produces a cluster of seed pods.*

*Note: due to a debate about who made the first discovery, there is a second Latin name for this species: Tetonus aymericus. For reasons of consistency in nomenclature, and probably also because of a certain prudery, Vista Genomics uses only the name Cactoida lapis. However, in order to be completely fair, we report this synonym here.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planets with thin Ammonia atmosphere
- Maximum gravity : 0.27

## Cactoida peperatis

### Description

*A cactoid species appearing as a swollen five-sided growth, reaching over two metres high and topped with an intersected crown.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planets with thin Ammonia atmosphere
- Maximum gravity : 0.27

## Cactoida pullulanta

Cactoida Pullulanta
 		 	 

### Description

*This species of cactoid has a globular base, from which extend vertical cylinders that can reach over four metres. Rounded pods grow in clusters along the cylinders, which break open to scatter seeds.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planets with thin Carbon Dioxide atmosphere
- Maximum gravity : 0.27
- Mean temperature between 180 K and 195 K

## Cactoida vermis

### Description

*These cactoids appear as a tall collection of cylinders linked by an undulating membrane and topped with a spiky crown. They often have a spiny life-form attached that is thought to form a symbiotic relationship with the larger organism, although the nature of this is not understood.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planets with thin Water atmosphere
- Maximum gravity : 0.27
