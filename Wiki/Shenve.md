**Shenve** (formerly designated **Witch Head Sector DL-Y d17**) is an Alliance system in the Witch Head Nebula within the Inner Orion Spur. It was one of the six systems settled in the first colonisation wave of The Enclave Interstellar Initiative spearheaded by Aegis in July 3305, and was originally managed by the Federation. In August 3305, Engineer Chloe Sedesi, an apprentice of Professor Ishmael Palin, established her workshop in the system at Cinder Dock.

On January 14, 3306, Universal Cartographics formally renamed the system from Witch Head Sector DL-Y d17 to Shenve. UC Chair Cynthia Sideris explained the change to Shenve and similar changes to 14 other Witch Head colonies had been made for the convenience of both residents and explorers.^[1]^^[2]^
