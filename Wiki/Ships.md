Group of ships
 		 	 

**Ships** are used to traverse the Milky Way and to perform a variety of tasks. There are currently 43 flyable ship models with configurable builds to suit roles and careers. Every ship is equipped with a Frame Shift Drive to supercruise at 100s times lightspeed in a star system and for interstellar travel via hyperspace. Many ship designs in Elite Dangerous are inspired by the wireframe and polygonal models of the classic Elite games. 

Every flyable ship is upgradeable and the components are fully customizable, with the exception of Ship Launched Fighters.^[1]^ There are a range of optional modules to specialize as a trader, smuggler, bounty hunter, pirate, etc. The modules can be changed or upgraded at Stations and Surface Ports with an Outfitting service. 

The starships are built by several manufacturers with unique styles and specifications. All Commanders start their careers with a Sidewinder Mk I. New ships are purchasable with credits. Pre-built ships are equipped with modules and engineering for ARX. The vessels are for sale via the Shipyard menu and Inter Astra in the Concourse of a station or surface port. Ships can only land on a planetary body without an atmosphere, or with a tenuous atmosphere. The latter requires Odyssey and the Advanced Planetary Approach Suite.

There are 6 Ship-Launched Fighters that can be deployed for combat or short-distance exploration. Commanders with at least 5 billion credits can buy a Drake-Class Carrier. This capital ship has 16 Landing Pads and various station services including customizable ship interiors and a max jump range of 500 light years. All ships are designed with ship interiors in mind and for future gameplay opportunities.

Players can join other ships as a hologram via multicrew. Nearly all ships and stations are fitted with GalNet for market information, galactic news and communication.^[2]^^[3]^

### Capital Ships

These are very large, capital sized, jump-capable vessels. The owner of a Drake-Class Carrier uses *executive control* to order hyperspace jumps between star systems. Owners can customise the interior with the onboard Livery service. It features 16 Landing Pads and a jump range of up to 500 light years. The Colonisation Ship is used for colonizing star systems. The Squadron Carrier supports the activities of a squadron.

    - *Main article: Pre-Built Ships*

A *Pre-Built Ship* is a package which includes instant-access to a pre-fitted ship, a ship kit, and a paintjob.^[5]^ It's themed to match an in-game activity.^[5]^ The purpose is to provide new and casual players with a solid start of their career without requiring to build ships from scratch.^[5]^ This benefits players because unlocking modules, outfitting and engineering ships is a complicated and time consuming grind. Pre-Built Ships have 0 rebuy cost unless you customize the loadout.

Available Pre-Built ships:

- Python Mk II Stellar
- Python Mk II Standard
- Laser Mining Jumpstart Type-6
- Exploration Jumpstart Diamondback Explorer
- AX Combat Jumpstart Alliance Chieftain

## Multicrew & Teams

Multicrew lets crewmembers join the bridge of 1 ship via telepresence. Members can assume 3 roles: Helm, Gunner, and Fighter Con. The Helm is the ship owner and pilot. The gunner controls the turrets and weapons. The Fighter Con can pilot SLFs. Crewmembers can also use the Full System Scanner and the Detailed Surface Scanner. A ship must have at least 2 seats for multicrew. Teams allows up to 4 pilots with ships to play together in a group.

## Ship size

 	 	[![Elite Dangerous Ship Size Chart 3.0.1 Dark](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/57/Elite_Dangerous_Ship_Size_Chart_3.0.1_Dark.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20240523132302)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/57/Elite_Dangerous_Ship_Size_Chart_3.0.1_Dark.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20240523132302) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
ED Ship Size Chart 3.0.1 Dark
 		 	 

The size of flyable ships ranges from small to large. Small ships have the lowest cost and tend to be very maneuverable. Medium ships have more hull mass, armor, cargo space and jump range. Large ships have more utility mounts, bigger weapons, cargo space, hull mass and armor. However, they are less maneuverable and have higher costs for outfitting and repair. Small and medium ships may be authorized to dock on larger landing pads if others are occupied. Large ships always require large landing pads so they cannot dock at small outposts.

## SCO optimized ships

Newer ships are optimized for the Frame Shift Drive (SCO). They have improved handling during Supercruise Overcharge, lower heat levels and less fuel consumption than other ships. Achilles Aerospace made the prototype FSD (SCO) available on the market on 10 April 3310.^[6]^

SCO boosts a ship to 100s of times the speed of light in seconds. Boosting drastically reduces travel time within a star system. The FSD SCO also offers a slightly increased max jump range compared to the standard FSDs. The increased fuel consumption and additional heat while in SCO can be mitigated by equipping the ship with extra Fuel Tanks and Heatsink Launchers, respectively.

## Ship Roles

### Multirole

Multirole/multipurpose ships are a jack-of-all-trades in that they can easily be fitted for whatever role the player needs, whether it be hauling cargo, ship-to-ship combat, or exploring the stars; multirole ships can do it all. Multirole ships can perform most jobs as well, if not better than, comparable ships targeted towards those jobs. Those ships, while considered multipurpose, sometimes lean into a more specialized role. The Imperial Courier, for example, is considered a multirole ship for being a superb combat and exploration vessel, but is less suited for trading/mining. Other examples of multirole ships are the Cobra Mk III, Python, and Anaconda.

### Combat

Combat ships are usually faster, more agile and more heavily armed than other ships of the same size. The exception to this would be gun boats, which have more weapon mounts designed for turrets, but sacrifice their agility for them. Some examples of combat-focused ships are the Viper Mk III, Fer-de-Lance, and Federal Corvette.

### Freighter

Freighters are typically slow, cumbersome and lightly armed, but provide extreme hauling capabilities. Useful for traders and smugglers alike. Some examples of trade-focused ships are the Hauler, Type-6 Transporter, and Type-9 Heavy.

### Explorer

Exploration ships typically come with large default jump ranges, large Fuel Tanks for ships of their size, and should be fitted with lots of low class Internal Compartments for scanners to optimize jump distance. These ships are designed to be able to equip the multitude of scanning equipment needed for an expedition, then fly long distances into the void without the need for regular refueling through the use of Fuel Scoops. Some examples of exploration-focused ships are the Diamondback Explorer, Asp Explorer, and Mandalay.

### Passenger

Couriers who fly passengers and valuable items with small storage requirements have a special class of ships available to them. These ships are elegant and fast, designed to quickly and comfortably get from one system to the next. Some examples of passenger-focused ships are the Dolphin, Orca, and Beluga Liner.

## Ship Interiors

> 
> 
> We're designing all the ships with the interiors in mind. How the cargo is unloaded all of that sort of thing, how damage occurs. That's because another thing we are doing is, again down the line, is that you will be able to walk around inside your ship. You'll be able to get out of your ship, walk around inside space stations, other vehicles. All of that sort of thing. We've shown the damage on the ship, the damage models. Imagine looking at that from inside the ship outwards seeing your cargo fly out into space, seeing the flames trying to fight them. All of those things that we plan with time, they won't be at the first release, because we want to do them right, we want to do them well. All of these will be done as updates. The game has to be structured in a way to allow it from the start. So we're designing the ships so that they work that way and so that when we come to do it, it's not a problem.

Currently, the Drake-Class Carrier is the only vessel with accessible ship interiors. All playable ships in *Elite Dangerous* were designed to include interior -  as well as exterior -  features, most notably in the distinct placement of various internal modules and the ways in which they take damage. During the very early stages of development for the game, David Braben expressed a desire to eventually implement walkable ship interiors in order to add more complex gameplay opportunities such as internal cargo loading/unloading or repairs.^[7]^

In Newsletter #29, it was mentioned as one of the planned updates on the roadmap: *"Walking around interiors and combative boarding of other ships"*^[8]^

Frontier released the video ''Cockpit Interiors'' on July 18, 2014: *"Spaceship interiors from Elite: Dangerous, a look at some of the work-in-progress. Getting up out of your seat and walking around your ship will be just the beginning for plans to expand Elite: Dangerous after the initial product. Imagine landing on planets or boarding other ships..."*^[9]^

As of June 8, 2021, shortly after the PC launch of *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*, ship interiors were not in active development, and Frontier Developments was focusing on improvements to *Odyssey* and preparing for its launch on consoles. Frontier community manager Arthur Tolmie (CM Arf) said on Lave Radio, *"I can relay the message as best I can. If players are saying ship interiors are an absolute must, obviously we'll assess it, but at the moment it's a case of where do we put our resources, and at the moment it's not ship interiors."*^[10]^^[11]^

## NPC Ships

### Capital Ships

The Federation's Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser and the Empire's Majestic-Class Interdictor are both Battlecruisers. They are heavily armed, can launch several fighter squadrons, and are piloted by NPCs. However, Frontier said in their roadmap that they intend to add the *"availability of giant ‘executive control’ ships to players"* in a future content update.^[12]^

In The Commanders Livestream, a viewer asked, *"Any chance of playing capital ships in the future?"*, David Braben answered, *"It's on the list, but a long way down it, because there's a lot of gameplay to make it work. The issue is what we call the difference between direct control and executive control. Where rather than flying by the seat of your pants you're giving orders to a giant ship. Because you can't expect it to change course very rapidly and that sort of thing. So it's certainly a long-term possibility, but it's long-term."*^[13]^

### Megaships

A Megaship is a class of massive ships that travel through the galaxy, and are utilized in a wide variety of roles.^[14]^ Comparable in size to most stations, and in some cases much longer, a number of Megaships are also equipped with docking facilities for small, medium, and large vessels. All services normally available at stations are on offer, with the exception of the Shipyard. Currently, only NPCs can directly control Megaships, but certain Player Groups can petition for Community Goals to construct new Megaships, and those with docking facilities are usually placed under the control of the sponsoring Group's Player Minor Faction. Even more rarely, a Player Group may be permitted to relocate their Megaship to a different location, as with The Gnosis.

There are various types of Megaships:^[14]^

- Bulk Cruiser
    - Asteroid Miner
    - Agricultural Vessel
    - Bulk Cargo Ship
    - Dredger
    - Prison Ship
    - Science Vessel
    - Survey Vessel
    - Tanker
    - Tourist Ship

- Flight Operations Carrier
    - Detention Centre
    - Rescue Vessel
    - Wells-class Carrier^[15]^

- Generation Ship

### Thargoid Ships

The Thargoids have 4 known ship types in their arsenal: Hunter, Interceptor, Scout and Titan. Each type has multiple variants except the Titan. Old logs retrieved from the Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm's Carmichael Point base attested to the existence of Titans. These capital ships were discovered inside Thargoid Maelstroms in 3309.

Thargoid vessels employ radically different technologies than human ships, such as the ability to interdict ships during hyperspace transit and hyperspace jump without leaving an identifiable wake signature. Their powerful offensive and defensive capabilities make them deadly opponents in combat.

## Development Notes: Fleet Hierarchy

The fleet-class ships that are available to the game's major factions follow a hierarchy.^[16]^

### Cruisers (Battlecruisers, Battleships, Interdictors)

Majestic-Class Interdictor
 		 	 

Long range, independent ships that are capable of controlling entire systems. Heavily armed and capable of deploying large fighter squadrons. The capital ships already shown are an example of this class. In the Empire they are usually known as “Interdictors” – named after the first successful class of cruisers. Currently the most common and most successful Imperial Cruiser is the Majestic-Class – generally referred to as a “Majestic-Class Interdictor”. As ships that can also carry out ambassadorial missions they can be used for ‘soft’ power projection, as well as hard, the same goes for the Federation's most common and successful Cruiser, named the Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser.

### Frigates

These are large ships designed for escort duties. The actual vessels vary greatly between navies, but are all designed to engage multiple small, fast enemies (typically fighters and missile swarms) and are loaded with point defence batteries. They will also have some anti-ship capability, but are not designed to go up against other warships.

### Destroyers

These are anti-warship vessels, but are generally no longer used in the front line, though some are still in service.

### Carriers

A Drake-Class Carrier
 		 	 

Carriers are designed for the deployment of fighter squadrons. They have been considered obsolete and phased out of the fleets of the major factions due to the popularity of Cruisers, but small navies still make use of them and some have even been converted into transporters.

The 34th century saw the resurgence of Carriers with the introduction of the Drake-Class Carrier, an aerospace product of Brewer Corporation.

### Transporters (Couriers)

Federal Dropship in a planetary ring
 		 	 

Armoured warships designed specifically for transporting valuable assets and cargo quickly and safely.

### Corvettes (Cutters)

 	 	[![Fed corvette](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/4/49/Fed_corvette.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20151115104243)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/4/49/Fed_corvette.png/revision/latest?cb=20151115104243) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Federal Corvette
 		 	 

Light multi-role warships, capable of reconnaissance, incursions and escort missions. These small warships are also popular with smaller factions, organizations and even wealthy individuals due to their adaptability. The Federal Corvette is a slower Corvette-class Ship with more maneuverability and firepower, while The Imperial Cutter is a lighter and faster Corvette-class ship, players will be able to get their hands on these ships in the game (assuming they can make the right contacts).

### Fighters

 	 	[![Imperial Fighter landed](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/2/27/Imperial_Fighter_landed.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20170212221303)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/2/27/Imperial_Fighter_landed.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170212221303) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Imperial Fighter
 		 	 

Small short-range craft that generally cannot operate independently due to having no jump capability. Their main roles include the defence of stations and the large warships that they are deployed from. Commercial fighters are typically jump-capable and are therefore much more flexible than their faction-specific counterparts.

### Drones

Small automated ships that have largely been phased out due to the existence of effective counter-measures. The closest setting-modern analogue would be Limpets, which are used almost purely for logistical/support tasks such as field repairs rather than direct combat, though some can be used for sabotage.
