> Orphaned at the age of seven, Domino was placed in a public relations initiative by the Rockforth Corporation; the company housed and educated her, but expected her to work for Rockforth as an adult. While displaying a prodigious talent for technology, she also lacked discipline and proved highly irreverent. She was dismissed as a poor investment and now operates a workshop established with her family inheritance.
