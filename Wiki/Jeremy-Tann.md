In 2876, President Tann launched an offensive to take control of the Phekda system after it descended into chaos as a result of economic instability and civil war. The Federation imposed a military governor on Phekda and attempted to repatriate the system under a new colonial charter, but after Tann left office, rebel insurrections began to take their toll. In 2897, the Federation abandoned Phekda.^[2]^
