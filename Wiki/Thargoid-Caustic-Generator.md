**Thargoid Caustic Generators** are non-sapient, biomechanical structures that can be found inhabiting Thargoid Maelstroms. They appear to behave like defensive mines, pursuing nearby ships and exploding on impact, causing malfunctions and thruster reboots to ships affected by the blast.

Research Limpets can be used to extract Caustic Tissue Samples from Thargoid Caustic Generators. 

Upon destruction, they drop Corrosive Mechanisms and Propulsion Elements.
