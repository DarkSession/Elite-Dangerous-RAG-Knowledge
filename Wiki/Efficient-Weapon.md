# Efficient Weapon
**Efficient Weapon** is an Engineer modification that can be applied to weapons. It reduces thermal load, distributor draw, and power draw to allow for longer, sustained fire at the cost of a reduced fire rate.

It is available in 5 grades, with the highest grade offering up to 60% decrease in thermal load and 40% decrease in power draw.
