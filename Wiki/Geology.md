# Geology
**Geology** is the study of the structure of astronomical objects and processes that have shaped them. The mineralogical composition of rocks gives insight into their history of formation. Important geological events are e.g. earthquakes, floods, orogeny (mountain building), plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions.

Several geological types have been discovered on planets and moons with 0 to tenuous atmospheres.

## Material farming

Geological sites are prime locations for farming protrusions for raw materials and synthesis. The actual materials produced depend on the composition of the planet such as:

- Piceous Cobble (Very Common Materials)
- Crystalline Fragments (Common Materials and Standard Materials)
- Crystalline Cluster (Standard Materials and Rare Materials)
- Needle Crystals (Rare Materials)

Fumarole locations spawn a combination of crystalline clusters, crystal fragments, needle crystals, and piceous cobble on the side of the fumarole vents. Shooting these objects with the SRV laser cannon allows them to be collected with the cargo scoop.

Such materials can be found on icy planets, high metal and rich metal worlds.

## Minerals

Minerals are chemical compounds that are mined from naturally-occurring deposits and can be refined into other substances. Some minerals are prized as precious gemstones and can fetch a high price at most markets.
