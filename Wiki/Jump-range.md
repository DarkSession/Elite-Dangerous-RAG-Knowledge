# Jump range
Jump range of the Asp Exporer
 		 	 

**Jump range** is a ship statistic that displays the maximum length of a Hyperspace jump. If the distance to a system is greater than the ship's jump range, then the ship is not able to jump there. A pilot can check their ship's current jump range in the Ship tab of the Internal Panel of the HUD.

## Factors

Jump range is primarily determined by the total mass of the ship and the installed Frame Shift Drive (FSD), which can be increased by the following means:

- Frame Shift Drive (SCO)
- Installing a higher class and/or higher grade FSD
- Installing lower-mass versions of other ship modules
- Installing a Guardian Frame Shift Drive Booster
- Engineering an FSD for increased jump range, and other modules for reduced mass
- Carrying less or no cargo
- Carrying less fuel (increasing the frequency of refuelling at stations or fuel scooping)
- FSD Injections
- FSD Supercharging

Ships with lower mass will achieve higher jump ranges with less effort, while ships with higher mass will require more effort just to achieve average jump ranges.

## Jump range comparison

Notable documented jump ranges for certain ships are listed below, including some non-pilotable vessels. The Mandalay can achieve a theoretical jump range of at least 99.38 ly assuming it carries only the fuel necessary for a single jump, which represents the current ceiling for jump range potential among conventional ships without FSD injection or overcharging; larger vessels, such as Fleet Carriers, Megaships, and Starports, have proportionally higher jump ranges.
