### Making the Case for Aegis

A three-day symposium has begun that will outline proposals to reform Aegis, the tri-superpower anti-xeno agency.

The event is taking place at the national conference centre in New Apollo City on the planet Biggs Colony. It has been organised by Professor Alba Tesreau, Aegis’s former head of research. In her opening address to attendees, she said:

“In the aftermath of HIP 22460’s failure to end the war, humanity remains locked in this fight against the Thargoids. I believe that we have become hyper-focused on military action, meaning we may never truly understand this species. Aegis’s collaborative nature was ideally suited for such work, but internal and external pressures resulted in its closure. I am officially declaring my aim to convince the Alliance, Empire and Federation to reverse that closure.”

Detailed plans to reform the organisation were presented by other former members of Aegis including Carter Armstrong, Dr Mia Valencourt and Yazhu Xing. Several issues highlighted by the Baumann Report, including mismanagement and low morale, were openly addressed. The audience was shown evidence that the loss of the Alexandria megaship, originally seen as an example of Aegis’s negligence, was due to sabotage and hijacking by Azimuth Biotech agents.

The hosts were also asked about the xeno-peace movement and the popular audio package released last week by ICE-caster Joy Senne. Professor Tesreau stated:

“Neither I nor any former Aegis staff are involved with the Thargoid Advocacy Project or any similar groups. But I have always believed that researching methods of inter-species communication should be a priority.”

A combination of politicians, scientists, naval officers and journalists were present on the first day of the event. The most high-profile guests included Allied Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran, Federal Ambassador Jasmina Halsey and Shadow Vice President Isolde Rochester. There were no representatives from the Empire, but a delegation from the Marlinist Colonies observed proceedings.

### Gatecrash Drama at Aegis Event

The sole survivor of the notorious Project Seraph experiments has reportedly appeared at the Aegis symposium, startling the live audience.

Vox Galactica journalist Allan Mantle published an on-the-scene report:

“The shouting caught everyone in the conference hall by surprise, interrupting a discussion about the recently leaked ‘Thargoid roar’ heard at HIP 22460. We all watched in amazement as a small figure in dishevelled clothing slipped past security and fought her way onto the stage, disarming several guards who sought to intervene. Many ran, fearing an attack, but Professor Alba Tesreau stood her ground.”

“The bedraggled woman yelled hoarsely that her name was Seo Jin-ae, adding ‘You know me!’ to Tesreau herself. When the intruder yanked up her sleeve as if to show something, I deployed my drone cameras which clearly captured the symbols ‘D-2’ ink-branded onto her forearm.”

“She then grabbed Professor Tesreau and said ‘I don’t know where else to go. I know…’ She gestured at the screens, where audio analysis of the HIP 22460 Thargoid sound was displayed. ‘I think I know what that means. It’s too late to stop what’s coming.’”

“Tesreau immediately ordered security to stand down. She called several other former members of Aegis to help, and together they escorted the woman off stage. Within minutes came the announcement that the symposium’s primary presentation was cancelled, with secondary talks would be moved to the main stage.”

Subject D-2 first came to light when the abandoned settlement Oaken Point was discovered in the HIP 26176 system. Its logs described Project Seraph’s attempts to create human pilots for Thargoid vessels, from which D-2 escaped by stowing away on a courier’s ship. In June, D-2 contacted Professor Tesreau to expose an INRA base in the DG Canum Venaticorum system, which revealed Salvation’s identity as Dr Caleb Wycherley of then-Azimuth Biochemicals.

### Operation Tyndareus Reacts to Thargoid Fleet

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The Alliance has deployed a reactionary task force to defend the Andecavi system from the Thargoids.

An anti-xeno taskforce, titled Operation Tyndareus, was recently prepared by the Alliance Defence Force in conjunction with Sirius Corporation. This followed the ratification of the strategic defence pact between the superpower and the megacorp.

Admiral Nikolas Glass, the Sirius Navy representative on the Council of Admirals, announced:

“The Thargoids have encroached upon Allied territory, providing an opportunity for Operation Tyndareus to put this newly legislated partnership to the test. The megaships provided by Sirius Corp are on combat readiness for just such an event, and Kumiho Sky has jumped directly to the Andecavi system to act as a mobile base of operations. The ADF will spearhead our counter-attack against the alien forces.”

“These are still early days for our unified anti-xeno efforts, so we are requesting additional support from independent pilots. Sirius Corporation will award its pre-engineered heatsink module to those who destroy adequate numbers of Thargoid vessels.”

The Andecavi system reported the presence of Thargoids over the past forty-eight hours. However, as with recent incursions into other populated systems, no starports have yet been attacked. Sirius Corporation will reimburse Thargoid combat bonds delivered to the Kumiho Sky over the next seven days.

### Defeat for the True Chapters

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

A battle in the Popontia system has ended with Federal forces overwhelming defenders of the True Chapters sect.

The newly risen sect of the Order of the Far God was being protected by the Workers of Popontia Free, which was ultimately defeated. Governor Nadia Machado of the Popontia Incorporated announced:

“With the welcome support of auxiliaries and independent pilots, armed resistance in this system has been quelled. As per President Hudson’s orders, the Thargoid worshippers will be detained and the megaship Dedicant seized for Federal investigation.”

Governor Machado added that all pilots who took part in the operation can now collect their rewards from Ryman Market. Despite its failure, the Workers of Popontia Free is also offering payments from Ryman Market.

The two remaining Far God megaships, the Testament and the Perdition, have abandoned their scheduled itineraries and jumped to unknown locations to avoid further strikes by Federal forces. Prior to this, the First Apostle transmitted a message from the Testament:

“This attempt to conceal the truth is doomed to fail. The Far God’s harbingers blaze in our skies, growing ever nearer. We await the time of humanity’s unavoidable extinction.”

### Azimuth: ‘We Can Help D-2’

Azimuth Biotech has publicly offered assistance to Subject D-2, the Project Seraph survivor who gate-crashed the recent Aegis symposium.

The woman, now identified as Seo Jin-ae, unexpectedly arrived at the event on Tuesday. She claimed to possess knowledge of the ‘Thargoid roar’ that was heard at HIP 22460 following the Proteus Wave’s activation. There is speculation that this relates to her inclusion in experiments to create human pilots for Thargoid vessels.

Professor Alba Tesreau has since issued a brief statement:

“Along with other former members of Aegis, I have provided sanctuary to Seo Jin-ae. She is currently receiving medical treatment at a private facility. Ms Seo’s safety and welfare is now my responsibility.”

Torben Rademaker, CEO of Azimuth Biotech, made the following declaration on public channels:

“We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the individual known as D-2, and would like to extend an offer of assistance. This tragically mistreated individual will receive little help from a random assortment of ex-Aegis personnel. With our decades of research and xenological specialists, Azimuth Biotech is far better suited to assess both her physical and mental health.”

“Her wellbeing would be our main concern, of course, but the possibility that D-2 can somehow interpret Thargoid communications should not be dismissed. We can help her to explore this ability, which may grant important insights into the Thargoid species.”

“I must also clarify that the Project Seraph facilities in HIP 22460 and HIP 26176 were under Salvation’s direct control, and were kept hidden from the wider corporation. The discovery of these sites was as much a shock to me as anybody else. It’s a matter of personal regret that Azimuth’s long history includes examples of such misguided operations. We are eager to make amends for Salvation’s mistakes.”

### Winters Condemns Oppression of Thargoid Cult

The Popontia conflict and the mass arrest of Far God cultists have received civil and political criticism across the Federation.

Shadow President Felicia Winters delivered a statement to The Federal Times:

“It is logical that any organisation supporting the Thargoids should come under scrutiny. But this does not justify the harsh and oppressive treatment of our own citizens for their religious beliefs. The Federal Accord safeguards their right to worship, as long as no laws are transgressed.”

“The Federal Navy Intelligence Office has accused the cult of disseminating classified material and damaging anti-xeno operations. I demand that their evidence be shared with the High Court, so that a legal ruling can be made.”

“I also call upon Congress to reject the secretary of state’s proposal to outlaw the Order of the Far God. This is nothing more than a blatant effort to prop up President Hudson’s waning powerbase.”

A multiple-choice survey held by Sol Today resulted in the majority selecting ‘traitorous cowards’ to describe cult members, showing that Hudson’s order is not without support. However, a Federal Free Press opinion poll suggested that many citizens are uncomfortable with hostile acts against ‘deluded but essentially innocent people’.

The Perdition and Testament megaships have now withdrawn from their standard patrol between the core system and the Pleaides, presumably to avoid further acts of hostility from the Federation. Dr Alfred Ulyanov observed that Federal citizens of the cult, along with the few remaining True Chapters adherents, were now concentrated aboard these megaships. Orthodox Far God hive-chapels are believed to still operate in Allied and independent systems.

### Subject D-2 Rejects Azimuth

Seo Jin-ae, the Project Seraph survivor, has refused to have any further contact with Azimuth Biotech following its offer of help.

She is currently in the care of Professor Alba Tesreau, who stated:

“It will come as no surprise that Ms Seo vehemently rejects Mr Rademaker’s proposal. She has relayed horrific details to me about her abduction years ago, and the invasive experimentation at Oaken Point. The fear that Azimuth operatives were hunting her never passed, resulting in total isolation from her former life to protect friends and loved ones. As things stand, she has no reason to trust the organisation responsible for her suffering.”

“Ms Seo’s health has improved, but I’m informed that a significant neural implant grafted into her cerebral cortex – designed to interface with a Thargoid vessel – can never be removed. With her permission, we are working to better understand the manner of the surgeries inflicted upon Ms Seo, along with her claimed interpretation of the ‘Thargoid roar’. I have contacted both Professor Ishmael Palin and Ram Tah for assistance.”

Azimuth Biotech CEO Torben Rademaker expressed disappointment at the response, and cast doubt on Seo Jin-ae’s legitimacy: “In her fragile emotional state, D-2 may be vulnerable to coercion by Professor Tesreau and other ex-Aegis radicals. Our medical teams have access to records detailing the procedures Oaken Point surgeons were carrying out. It would be unwise of Tesreau to choose self-interest over the chance to truly heal D-2.”

In related news, several newsfeeds have reported an initial bump in public support for the reinstatement of Aegis. Following her attendance at the symposium, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran told the Old Worlds Gazette:

“Operation Tyndareus has been initiated, with forces engaged in protecting the Andecavi system. Yet the Alliance should not rely exclusively on Sirius Corporation for anti-xeno defence. I believe that the return of Aegis is an option deserving serious consideration.”
