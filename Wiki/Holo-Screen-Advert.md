Holo-Screen Adverts adorning an Outpost
 		 	 

**Holo-screen Adverts** are advertisements for organisations and products that are displayed by holographic projectors and drones placed inside and around Stations, Surface Ports, and Concourses. The displayed images consist of combinations of red, blue, and green dots, which become visible when they are observed up-close.^[1]^

Advertised subjects are corporations, some selected ships, rare commodities, tourist destinations, player initiatives (such as the Fuel Rats and Buckyball Racing Club), present superpowers and powers, or small reminders to pilots.
