**Sadler's Song** is a Flight Operations Carrier Megaship. Along with its sister vessel The Conduit, it is part of a ferry service between the systems Zende and Synuefe EN-H d11-96, which was built by the minor faction Zende Partners via the Bridging the Gap Interstellar Initiative to increase travel between the Core Systems and Guardian space.^[1]^^[2]^^[3]^

## Flight Plan

Every Thursday at 07:00 Universal Galactic Time, Sadler's Song will jump from one terminus of the ferry service, either Zende or Synuefe EN-H d11-96, to the other, trading locations with The Conduit. All ships that are fully docked inside a hangar aboard Sadler's Song before the jump will travel with it during the jump.^[1]^
