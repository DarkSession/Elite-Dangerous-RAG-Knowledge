The **Planetary Vehicle Hangar** is an optional internal module that can store one or more Surface Recon Vehicles (SRV), such as the Scarab or Scorpion. When installed, SRVs can be deployed from a ship's cargo bay when it is landed on the surface of a terrestrial planet or docked in a Surface Port. The module does not include any SRVs, which must be purchased separately. Multiple Planetary Vehicle Hangars can be installed at once on the same ship.
