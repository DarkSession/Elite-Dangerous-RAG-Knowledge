A **Rogue Signal Source** is a type of signal source which is visible at ranges of several light years. They were first detected moving from the Orion Complex towards the bubble in 3308, following Salvation's failed deployment of the Proteus Wave in HIP 22460.

## Signal Contents

A rogue signal source has a spiraling light green flare appearance in flight, appearing progressively dimmer and redder with distance. The signal is emitted by a Thargoid Titan traveling at superluminal speed between star systems. During the initial Thargoid invasion of the human occupied bubble, their destination was always an Ammonia World, around which they would deploy a Thargoid Maelstrom. The only time a Titan has been observed deploying around a non-Ammonia World was in the closing weeks of the conflict, when the final Titan (Cocijo) reverted to a Rogue Signal Source and traveled to the Sol system, redeploying around planet Earth^[1]^. An update to the FSS allows Pilots to zoom in to any active rogue signal sources, which will pick-up a churning bio-mechanical sound. 

Rogue signal sources travel at immense speeds, estimated to be in excess of 6,000 times the speed of light - far faster than any human craft before the development of SCO technology (which was itself a product of research into Titan drive components).  

## Notes

- You can no longer find rogue signal sources, because they transformed into Thargoid Maelstroms.
- They were first discovered in Slegi JD-W b46-0 by Commander GoidByte.
- The signal source would instantly crash the game whenever someone attempted to drop into the flare or enter within a diameter of 0.40 megameter. Crash reports consisted of codes about the Thargoid Titan, and attempts to re-log in would move their vessel away
- When you approached prior to arrival, behind your ship is a dim cloud, set Gamma to maximum in the Graphics setting to reveal a green cloud. ^[2]^
