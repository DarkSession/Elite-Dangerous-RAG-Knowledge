**Hi-Cap** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to Shield Generators through Engineering. It increases optimal strength at the cost of increased power consumption and distributor draw.

## Effects

| Statistic | Change | +ve/-ve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Distributor Draw | +25% | - |
| Optimal Strength | +8.19% | + |
| Power Draw | +10% | - |

## Applicability

The effect is available for the following modules:

- Shield Generators:
    - Standard Shield Generator
    - Prismatic Shield Generator
    - Bi-Weave Shield Generator

## Required Materials

- 5x Worn Shield Emitters
- 3x Flawed Focus Crystals
- 1x Conductive Polymers
