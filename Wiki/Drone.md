A **drone** is an unmanned aircraft or spacecraft that is not operated by a pilot on-board, and is instead either controlled remotely or capable of functioning autonomously to fulfill a programmed set of instructions.^[1]^ Drones can be designed for countless roles, including security, military service, firefighting, aerial surveillance, and displaying Holo-Screen Adverts.

Limpets are a general-purpose drone that are assigned specific functions based on the type of Limpet Controller used to operate them. Advertisement drones can be seen outside some starports and installations. Skimmers and camera drones are examples of remotely-piloted drones.
