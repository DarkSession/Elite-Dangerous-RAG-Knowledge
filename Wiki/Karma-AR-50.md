## Overview

The Karma AR-50 automatic rifle is a solid all-rounder with comparatively good power and range.^[1]^ While it packs more punch and has a slightly greater range than the Karma C-44, it also has a looser firing pattern and slower fire rate.

With the Stability modification applied, the AR-50 has nearly zero recoil. Coupled with the Scope and Greater Range mods, the AR-50 can reliably be used far outside its intended range.

- The magazine well being in the stock makes the AR-50 a bullpup weapon, yet the casing ejection port is placed in front of the grip when it should be placed behind it.
