# Phasing Sequence
**Phasing Sequence** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to weapons through Engineering. It is a bleed through modulating burst fire system designed to defeat shielding. Around 9%^[1]^ of damage is able to "bleed" through shields and attack the target's hull directly doing absolute damage, at the cost of 10% damage reduction. The damage that phases through shields seems to be calculated off the damage shown in weapon's statistic before taking into account target's resistances and damage falloff from excessive range.
