The **AX Xeno Scanner** is an experimental scanner created by Professor Palin for Aegis. Released on September 28, 3303, the AX Xeno Scanner is a utility module capable of scanning and identifying Thargoid Interceptors and Thargoid Scouts. Using it on a Thargoid Interceptor is the only way to highlight its Thargoid Hearts in order to target them with weapons, although a scan is not required to be able to inflict damage. AX Xeno Scanners can be purchased at military, high-tech, and industrial planetary bases.

> Xeno Scanners are the only way of discovering information on xeno-biological vessels. The passive scan element is capable of reading shape, size and vessel type, as well as hull integrity and combat information. The active scan is short range, but produces more detailed information, such as sub target information, detailed variant information and vital data required for research and development.
