After remaining defunct for millennia, **The 10th Legion** was commissioned to serve as a special mission unit for Imperial Intelligence. Proposed by officers from the Loyalist Remnant of Dragoons, the purpose of the revival was to provide the IIS with a legion that, like its ancient predecessor, could be trusted absolutely by its superiors to carry out critical missions whilst maintaining the highest degree of secrecy and reliability. Following the notoriously difficult selection process, all legionnaires are trained in the arts of subterfuge and asymmetrical warfare. It can only be speculated where these skills are put into practice.
