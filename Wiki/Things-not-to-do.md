## In stations

### Loitering

Do not block the access corridor or any landing pad you haven't been assigned to. Doing so counts as loitering and is grounds for a fine or a lethal response.

### Speeding

Do not fly above 100m/s inside stations. If you crash into another ship while doing 100m/s+, you will be fined. You may also get a bounty if the other ship is destroyed.

### Trespassing

Always ensure you have docking permission before entering a station. 

If you have docking permission, there will be blue text towards the bottom of your screen reading 'Procced to landing pad XX'. This is the landing pad you should land on.

Trespassing (entering stations without permission) will result in a fine and lethal action if you don't leave the station immediately.

## In space

### Running out of fuel

Try not to run out of fuel. If you are running low on fuel, you should stop at a station or fuel scoop a KGBFOAM star, if one is present.

#### The Fuel Rats

### Getting too close to stars

If you supercruise too close to a star, your ship will emergency stop and you'll have to wait for an extended FSD cooldown before you can continue your journey. It can also damage your ship.

Your ship will also get hot and that can cause damage and malfunctioning modules.

### Trying to supercruise to the next system

Doing so doesn't work. You need to hyperjump to the next system. If you try to supercruise to another system, it will just result in a black void when you arrive. You could also run out of fuel mid-journey causing you to get stranded.

### Using silent running mode for no reason

This mode closes your heat vents causing heat to build up in your ship. This can cause malfunctions in your modules and hull damage.

### Overusing FSD overcharge

If you have a SCO FSD, you have the ability to overcharge it using the boost key. The problem is this uses a lot of fuel and is very powerful which could make you miss your destination. You should only use FSD overcharge during long trips of several hundred kilo-lightseconds, and only for short blasts at a time, becase it also makes your ship heat up.

### Interdicting random ships

Wrongfully interdicting a ship is grounds for a fine.
