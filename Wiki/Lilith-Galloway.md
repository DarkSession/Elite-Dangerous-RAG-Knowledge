## Timeline

17 APR 3305

- Aegis has entered into a partnership with the engineer Ram Tah to manufacture Guardian-related technology. Senior Engineer Lilith Galloway made the following statement on behalf of Aegis: "We believe that Ram Tah's accomplishments, while impressive, represent only a fraction of what can be accomplished. We have therefore entered into an agreement that will allow Aegis to bring its considerable resources to bear in the manufacture of Guardian-related technology, both now and in the future." Galloway confirmed that technology brokers would remain licensed distributors of the Trident, Javelin and Lance XG fighters. Ram Tah also gave a short statement to the media: "To me, Aegis represents what can be achieved when humanity pulls together, and I am delighted to be entering into this partnership."^[1]^

- Three starports attacked and damaged by Thargoid forces have now been restored to full functionality. Carter Armstrong, chief administrator with Aegis Core, told the press: "When we requested help to repair Thargoid-hit starports, we hoped the galactic community would be generous, but they exceeded our expectations. A colossal influx of materials has enabled us to repair two stations in the core systems in record time. I'm pleased to announce that Armstrong Enterprise in the Bhal system and Beaufoy Vision in the Nauni system are now open for business. Keeping these starports operable allows us to honour those who lost their lives in the Thargoid attacks. Enormous thanks to everyone who participated." Senior Engineer Lilith Galloway of Aegis Research, who coordinated a parallel project, released a similar statement: "Here in the Pleiades, survival is never guaranteed. But Reed's Rest in Merope has endured, thanks to the galactic community's incredible support. This is what we do when things get tough – we rebuild and come back stronger." All three starports are now fully operational and providing a range of services.^[2]^

- There has been a positive response to the campaign to fund repairs for starports in the Pleiades Nebula. Huge quantities of construction materials were received, which will be used to restore many of the stations damaged by the Thargoids. Senior engineer Lilith Galloway made a statement on behalf of Aegis Research: "We didn't expect so many of you to help. But that's the spirit here in the Pleiades – we come back stronger. Our thanks to everyone who supplied us with what we need." Pilots who contributed to this project can now collect their rewards from The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55 system.^[3]^

01 JUN 3304

- A fund has been set up by the Aegis Research to repair starports in the Pleiades Nebula that have been damaged during the Thargoid conflict. Senior engineer Lilith Galloway made this announcement: "We've had the worst of it here. The Thargoids have given us a bloody nose on several occasions. But we are strong, we will heal, and you can help. We're asking for pilots to deliver as much as they can fit in their holds. We're going to rebuild our starports better than ever. Let's get the Pleiades fighting fit once more." Traders are requested to deliver construction materials to The Oracle in the Pleiades Sector IR-W D1-55 system. The campaign begins on the 31st of May 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.^[4]^
