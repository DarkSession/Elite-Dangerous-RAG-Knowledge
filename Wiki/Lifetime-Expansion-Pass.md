# Lifetime Expansion Pass
The **Lifetime Expansion Pass** or **LEP** is a content pass for *Elite Dangerous* that includes ownership of any and all expansions produced for the game, plus access to all betas and a selection of cosmetic Livery items.

The LEP was included as a backer reward for purchasers of the £80 "Digital Download Pack" tier of the *Elite Dangerous* Kickstarter in 2012. During the pre-launch beta period in 2014, it was also included in the Premium Beta bundle for £100.00 ($150.00 USD). It was made available for a third and final time from August 6, 2015 to September 14, 2015, at a cost of £130.00 ($195.00 USD); existing owners of *Elite Dangerous* were given a £10.00 ($15.00 USD) loyalty discount.
