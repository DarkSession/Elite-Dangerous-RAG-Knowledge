## History

Despite its relatively short distance from the Empire's capital of Achenar, Cemiess was left undeveloped until the 31st century.  The Federation planned to begin terraforming the moon Cemiess 4 a in 3031, but this was stalled by Governor Raul Santorini of Tau Ceti, an influential and fiscally-conscious Congressman who saw the project as a waste of money. A renewed colonisation push in 3055 resulted in a colonial charter and the construction of a small outpost in the system, establishing a solid Federal presence, but Santorini again delayed the terraforming mission's funding. The Empire drew up its own colonial charter for Cemiess that same year, but was similarly unable to set its plans into motion, even after Emperor Gaylen Trasken Duval approved the colonisation of Cemiess in 3061, his final official act before his death.^[3]^^[4]^

In 3080, the Empire finally attempted terraforming Cemiess 2, spurred by the onset of a massive migration wave from independent, Galactic Cooperative, and Federal worlds to Imperial space; the move effectively ended Federal ambitions in the system, and was applauded by Governor Santorini.^[4]^^[3]^ For unknown reasons, the terraforming of Cemiess 2 was soon dropped in favor of terraforming Cemiess 4 a. The first Imperial colonists landed on the newly-verdant Cemiess 4 a, renamed Emerald, in 3101, but this provoked a minor war with the Federation over control of the system. In addition to the Empire's insult of settling what had once been a prospective Federal colony, the Federation publicly suspected the Empire of assassinating Governor Santorini in 3098 despite the Empire benefitting from the governor's moves to rein in the Federal budget, noting that Santorini had made numerous anti-Imperial statements in his speeches.^[3]^^[5]^ Federal Admiral O'Brien arrived and landed troops on Emerald, and the two superpowers grappled for control of the moon for the next three decades. Ultimately, O'Brien's invasion was defeated and the Imperial XV Fleet was permanently stationed in the system, cementing the Empire's claim.^[5]^^[6]^^[3]^ The end of the dispute over Cemiess was formally marked in 3136 with the Emerald Treaty, in which the Federation abandoned its claim to the system in exchange for Emperor Hender Saik Duval abolishing Imperial Slavery within the system.^[3]^

Kahina Tijani Loren, alias CMDR Salomé, was attacked by unknown forces while traveling through Cemiess on August 23, 3302, three days after former members of Emperor's Dawn attempted to assassinate Senator Denton Patreus during a public appearance at Mackenzie Relay. Searchers found no trace of her ship.^[7]^^[8]^ Loren resurfaced in Imperial custody on September 19, when it was announced that she was to be put on trial for the attempt on Patreus's life.^[9]^

On September 10, 3306, Mackenzie Relay was one of four Imperial starports bombed by the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army.^[10]^ The attack caused the reclusive Prince Harold Duval, father of Princess Aisling, to travel to the system to meet with his daughter. On September 14, while en route from Capitol, Prince Harold was assassinated by an NMLA member who had infiltrated his personal ship.^[11]^
