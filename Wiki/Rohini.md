> This Earth-like world was discovered by the Chapterhouse of Inquisition's Long-Range Aid Convoy mission to Jaques Station in August 3302. It has been earmarked for future investigation by the group's xenobiologists, and if settled could one day act as a way-point base facilitating transit to and from the Colonia Nebula. Rohini in Hindu mythology is one of the children of the goddess Kamadhenu (the Empire system of Kamadhenu is home to the Chapterhouse of Inquisition). This location was suggested by Commander Edgar Starwalker.
