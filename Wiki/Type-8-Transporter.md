## Overview

Lakon Spaceways describes the Type-8 as the premier medium-sized trade vessel.^[1]^ It is specifically designed for cargo hauling, with a maximum cargo capacity of 406 tons. The Type-8's engines retract into the body when its landing gear is deployed, which allows it to fit on the medium landing pads of outposts and starports.^[3]^ 

The Type-8 has a default jump range of 17.55 ly when fully laden and 23.42 ly when unladen. Its improved hull stress capacity and interlaced polymer drive insulation over older ships makes it optimized for Frame Shift Drive (SCO).^[1]^

As a freighter, the Type-8 fills the gap between the Type-7 Transporter and the Type-9 Heavy. However, the Type-8 can also be used as a multi-purpose ship. The Type-8's modernised SCO-compatible design gives it an advantage over the Type-7 and Type-9 in terms of range and accessible locations and it has a cargo capacity that is almost as big as an Anaconda's. While it is less maneuverable than and slower than a Python Mk II with FSD (SCO), the Type-8 is more fuel efficient and heat resistant, thus providing a stabler ride when supercruise overcharge is active. Maneuverability is decent but does not compare to a Fer-de-Lance.^[3]^

Type-8 hardpoints convergence
 		 	 

The Type-8's industrial design has 2 prongs (arms) in the front with 2 small hardpoints that are visible when deployed. The cockpit has 1 pilot seat and is similar to the Type-7 and the Type-9. It has 6 hardpoints: 5 small, 1 medium.^[3]^ the medium hardpoint is underneath at the back behind the cargo bay. There are 9 optional internals: 1x size 1, 1x size 2, 1x size 4, 2x size 5, 3x size 6, 1x size 7. Core internals: powerplant, thrusters, FSD and the fuel tank are size 5. Life support and sensors are size 3. The power distributor is a size 4.^[3]^

## Multirole builds

While the Type-8 is intended to be used as a medium freighter, it can be outfitted for mining and exploration with some engineering upgrades.

### Freighter

The Type-8 can carry 406 tons of cargo if all its Internal Compartments are fitted with Cargo Racks of the highest Class, or 374 tons if a Class 5 Shield Generator is fitted.^[6]^ Equipping 5A Dirty Thrusters with the Drag Drives experimental effect gives the Type-8 a boost speed of 481 m/s when laden and 541-550 m/s when unladen.^[6]^

### Mining

The Type-8 can be outfitted as a mining rig.^[6]^ An example loadout, which gives the Type-8 192 tons of cargo capacity and a fully-laden jump range of 26 ly, consists of:

- 2B Seismic Charge Launcher
- 3 x 1D Mining Laser
- 1D Abrasion Blaster
- 1D Sub-surface Displacement Missile
- 4A Overcharged Power Plant
- 5D Dirty Thrusters with Drag Drives
- 5A Frame Shift Drive (SCO) (optionally Increased Range with Mass Manager)
- 3D Life Support
- 4A Weapon Focused Power Distributor with Cluster Capacitors
- 3D Sensors
- 7E Cargo Rack
- 6E Cargo Rack
- 3 x 5A Collector Limpet Controller
- 5A Shield Generator
- 3A Prospector Limpet Controller
- 2A Refinery
- 1I Detailed Surface Scanner

### Explorer

The Type-8 can be outfitted for exploration. An example loadout that gives 52 ly of jump range consists of:

- 4A Power Plant
- 4A Thrusters
- 5A Increased Range Frame Shift Drive (SCO) with Mass Manager
- 3D Life Support
- 1A Power Distributor
- 3D Sensors
- 3 x 0E Shield Booster

## Development

Frontier announced that this ship will be added with a free update in 2024. While the Python Mk II is a variant, the Type-8 is a brand new ship. It's inspired by the concept designs for Alien by the artist Ronald Ray Cobb (Ron Cobb, 1937–2020).^[2]^

### Release

The Type-8's early-access release for ARX was released on the 7th of August 2024.^[4]^ The early access Type-8 standard version (default yellow skin) costs 16,520 ARX.^[6]^ The Type-8 Stellar Edition with a ship kit, red & black skin, a-rated (not engineered) costs 33,000 ARX.^[6]^ The free version for in-game credits was released on 28th November, 2024.^[5]^
