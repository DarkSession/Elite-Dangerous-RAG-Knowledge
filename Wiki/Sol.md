> The Sol system is notable as the birthplace of humanity and the capital of the Federation, one of the galaxy's three superpowers. Mars, which was terraformed in 2286, is the primary residence of the Federal president, and the seat of Federal power. The system is characterised by a widespread reliance on technology and the prevalence of monolithic corporate entities. The permit for this system can be obtained from the Federal military.

**Sol**, also known as the **Solar System**, is the capital system of the Federation. It is located at the centre of the Core Systems in the Inner Orion Spur region of the Milky Way galaxy, at galactic coordinates 0/0/0. Access to Sol is restricted, and requires a permit that can only be obtained by achieving the Federal Navy rank of Petty Officer.

Olympus Village on Mars has served as the political and financial centre of the Federation since the 24th century. It is home not only to the White House and Federal Congress, but the headquarters of major corporations such as Core Dynamics. The planet Earth, the birthplace of humanity and the Federation's previous capital world, has become a popular tourist destination due to its historical and cultural importance.

## History

### Rise of the Federation

Humanity made its first steps into space from Earth in the mid-20th century, and began deploying automated probes to study the worlds of Sol. More extensive manned exploration of Sol in the 21st century for the purpose of resource exploitation and colonisation was delayed for decades when World War III broke out in 2044, but the conflict effectively unified the human species under a single government, the United States of the Americas, which then evolved into the Federation. Beginning in 2097, humans launched thousands of Generation Ships to travel among the stars and colonise distant new worlds, and the invention of the hyperdrive by Li Qin Jao in the 22nd century accelerated the human diaspora even further.^[1]^

In the 23rd century, the Federation implemented the Earth Environmental Recovery Programme to restore Earth, which was heavily polluted and still partially irradiated from World War III, to a more pristine state. The Federation also grew from an Earth-based global government into an interstellar federal union and superpower following the signing of the Federal Accord in 2242, which recognised colonies in the systems of Tau Ceti, Delta Pavonis, Altair, and Beta Hydri as equal members. At the time, the Federation's capital remained the city of Washington, D.C. on Earth. In 2290, however, the terraforming of Mars was completed, and there was an exodus of people and corporations from Earth to the former "Red Planet".^[1]^^[2]^

In the 2325, the Federation suffered its first major military defeat in the Battle of Achenar, which resulted in the rise of the Empire as the second superpower. This fueled a wave of discontent among the Federation's member systems about Earth's continued role as the Federation's capital. The Federal government selected Mars, already a burgeoning economic hub, as its new capital world, and relocated the White House, Federal Congress, the Federal High Court, and other offices and departments to Olympus Village. While Mars was not a frontier colony, the Federation's other members were placated by the move because the selection process fairly considered other locations outside of Sol. Earth remained a place of great cultural and historical significance, and by the time its environment was fully restored, it had become a major tourism destination for travelers across the Core Systems.^[1]^^[3]^

### 34th century

Imperial Senator Kahina Tijani Loren of Prism made a highly publicised visit to Sol in March and April 3301.^[4]^^[5]^ She toured the system's gas giants, the Mars High starport, and Cambridge and London on Earth.^[6]^^[7]^^[8]^^[9]^

On April 23, 3301, the Buckyball Racing Club selected the starport Galileo in Sol as the starting point for one of its most ambitious and memorable races, the Buckyball Run A\*, which terminated at Sagittarius A\* at the centre of the galaxy.^[10]^

The starport Li Qing Jao was one of several stations that reported technical malfunctions and were forced to partially suspend services on November 19, 3301.^[11]^ It was later determined that the malfunctions were caused by Thargoid Sensors and other Thargoid objects which were being illegally traded through black markets.

Independent pilots exploring the outskirts of Sol in December 3301 discovered the ancient probes Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.^[12]^

Astronomers in Sol reaquired the signal of another probe, the long-lost New Horizons, on April 13, 3304, and it was quickly located by independent pilots.^[13]^

On August 30, 3304, President Zachary Hudson announced that Aegis Core, the main department of the interstellar Thargoid research organisation Aegis, would be relocated from Socho to Sol in response to Socho's deteriorating security conditions. The relocation process was completed on July 4, 3305.^[14]^^[15]^

The Sol-focused newsfeed Mars Tribune was shuttered on November 22, 3304 after the Federal Security Service uncovered an illegal surveillance operation that used Achilles Corporation PA912 administrative assistant robots to spy on their owners.^[16]^ The Mars Tribune's role was eventually assumed by another newsfeed, Sol Today.

Between January 25 and February 8, 3307, the high-profile trial of Federal Navy Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent was held at the Federal High Court in Olympus Village. Vincent was convicted of treason and conspiracy to commit murder for his involvement in the Starship One disaster of 3301, in which hundreds of Federal officials were killed and then-President Jasmina Halsey only narrowly survived.^[17]^^[18]^ The trial also exposed Jupiter Rochester, the CEO of Core Dynamics, as the second mastermind of the assassination conspiracy.^[19]^

The starport Li Qing Jao was bombed by the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army on March 11, 3307, along with starports in eight other major systems. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed in the Nine Martyrs attack, and many more were injured. The coordinated attacks occurred during the Galactic Summit in Sirius, and caused the conference to be cancelled.^[20]^^[21]^ Among the tens of thousands who died at Li Qing Jao were Vice President Brad Mitchell and several members of President Hudson's Cabinet.^[22]^

### Invasion of Titan Cocijo

The last Titan, Cocijo, has unexpectedly left the Col 285 Sector BA-P c6-18 system, and is now coming to Sol. Sol is now being evacuated, with temporary Sol permits given to pilots to help in the evacuation. All passengers must evacuate to Rescue Ship Cornwallis in the V886 Centauri system. Only an alert has been issued, but soon, Sol might be under control of the Thargoids, and all starports will be destroyed, and even if the invasion is successful, said Titan will be at Sol, but we don't know where the Maelstrom will be. Since Titans only reside on worlds with an ammonia-based atmosphere, and because Sol only has Class I gas giants (Jupiter-Neptune), metal-rich (Mercury), high-metal content (Venus), Earth-like (Earth [of course] and Mars) and icy bodies (90482 Orcus and its moon, Vanth and beyond, Europa, Enceladus-Rhea, Umbriel-Oberon and Triton), it must pick which planet to reside on. It is orbiting Earth since 6 December 3310. 

AX pilots eventually defeated the Thargoid invasion fleet.^[23]^ Titan Cocijo exploded on 18 December 3310.^[23]^ Its cloud and wreckage remain in Earth's orbit. This concluded the Second Thargoid War.^[23]^ However, a day later, a civil war erupted between the minor factions Mother Gaia and Workers of Sol.^[24]^ They were being influenced into conflict before the Battle for Sol started. These two factions wage a war for the remnants of Sol.^[24]^

## Notes

- All Alpha and Beta backers were automatically granted the permit to Sol.
- The Sol System in Elite Dangerous is different in various ways to its real life counterpart:
    - Mars has two small moons in real life - Phobos and Deimos. These might have been destroyed during the terraforming of Mars in 2286 in Elite Dangerous. In real life, Phobos is slowly spiralling towards Mars, adding another theory that both may have impacted Mars - though this is unlikely, as Phobos is not supposed to collide with Mars for at least 30 million years. Alternatively, it may be torn apart by tidal forces - however this has not occurred in the game, as this would leave a planetary ring. This also does not explain the disappearance of Deimos, as it maintains a further, stable orbit.
    - The system in real life has two asteroid belts - the Main Belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and the Kuiper Belt beyond Pluto. There is also a cluster of "Trojan" asteroids around each of the two Lagrange points on Jupiter's orbit, and "Near-Earth Objects" (NEOs) that are constantly being monitored.
    - The rings of Jupiter and Neptune are extremely faint and cannot easily be seen with the naked eye. The rings of Saturn and Uranus, on the other hand, are more visible.
    - The real Sol system has numerous "dwarf" planets - Ceres, Eris, Sedna, Quaoar, Makemake, Haumea, Ixion, and much more. Pluto is one of these, but is included in the game since it was considered a planet historically and at the time of release of *Frontier: Elite II*.
    - Jupiter and Saturn in the real-life Sol system both have almost 70 moons, Uranus has 27, and Neptune has 14. Most of them are tiny.
    - Pluto has 5 moons - but all except Charon are tiny.
- At a distance of 2.07 million light-seconds, Voyager 2 can be found. Voyager 1 can also be found. Their recorded messages are played in various languages. Additionally to the original lines, David Braben can be heard saying "To all our friends in outer space, may you have a wonderful time exploring it.". This line plays after the German message.
- Burnell Station and Titan City seem to have the best weapon outfitting selection in the system, while the stations around Earth seem to have the best internal outfitting.
