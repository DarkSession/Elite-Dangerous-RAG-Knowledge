# Boost Speed

**Boost Speed** is the speed that a ship travels when the boost function is activated (Default "Tab" or "B" on Xbox). When activating boost the ship's thrusters are pushed past their normal capabilities which provides extra speed and maneuverability.

## Overview

Boost can only be activated in normal space when there is enough energy in the ships Engine capacitor and generates heat upon activation. Boost speeds vary from ship to ship and range from 200 m/s to 460 m/s with non-Engineered Thrusters. Upgrading the Power Distributor can allow for more frequent boosts, while upgrading Thrusters allows for a higher boost speed.

Boosting is very useful in combat and when used correctly can provide a significant edge. Activating a boost and quickly turning with Flight Assist Off can allow a pilot to change the direction they're facing. Spamming boost can allow a player to move faster than usual and possibly outrun attackers or catch up with prey; this tactic works better with some ships more than others. For example, while the Viper MkIII has the fastest normal speed, the Cobra MkIII can move faster when constantly activating boost. Be aware that boosting into or out of starports is exceedingly risky and can lead to fatal collisions.

The automatic deceleration after the boost is managed by the on-board Flight Assist.

## Boost Energy

The amount of energy required to boost is a fixed amount per ship. If a given distributor does not have sufficient capacity, it will not be possible to boost even with a full capacitor.
