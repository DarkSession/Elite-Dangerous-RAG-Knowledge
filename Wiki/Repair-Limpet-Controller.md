The **Repair Limpet Controller** is a type of Limpet Controller module that can program limpets to repair the hulls of damaged ships. It is the only means by which a ship can restore its hull outside of the repair services of a docking facility.

## Usage

A single Repair Limpet restores only a portion of hull value, and multiple Limpets may be required to fully repair a ship. Repair Limpets do not affect modules, which can be repaired with an Auto Field-Maintenance Unit, but they can repair a Ship Canopy  provided that it has not been fully broken. If a limpet is deployed without an active target, it will attempt to repair its mothership instead. With Chapter Four (3.3) of *Elite Dangerous: Beyond*, Repair Limpets can also be used to repair Hull Breaches on damaged Megaships.

One or more Repair Limpets can be active at once depending on the module's class; however a ship can be repaired by a single limpet at a time. Attempting to deploy more will cause the oldest Limpet on that target to self-destruct. A Limpet's repair progress is indicated on the target by a circular bar around a spanner icon, along with the range to the target in meters; the bar will start out empty and gradually fill clockwise as repairs progress. Once the bar is full, the Limpet has expended its Repair Capacity and will self-destruct.

The Repair Limpet's Capacity value seems to be a 1:1 exchange to Hull Integrity, unlike the Material/Integrity conversion rate system used by Auto Field-Maintenance Units. It is important to keep in mind that larger ships that have large Hull Integrity pools will require higher-Class Limpet Controllers for effective repairs. Additionally, while higher-Class controllers *do* repair faster, the proportion of repair speed to repair value is not constant. Higher-Class limpet controllers will take longer to fully complete their repairs, but there is no difference in repair amount or speed between different grades of controllers; a grade D will repair just as fast and as much as a grade A. Repair Speeds are as follows:

| Class | Repairs/Second | Active Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1.5 | 40s |
| 3 | 2 | 90s |
| 5 | 3.1 | 100s |
| 7 | 4.5 | 100s |

> Limpets controlled by this module can partially fix the hull of a targeted ship. This task takes an amount of time, during which both vessels must remain within a set distance of each other. Any external damage to the affected vessel will cancel the process immediately.
