**Team missions** can be shared with up to four teammates. A solo player can do it as well, but a Team is recommended due to the high requirements. There are various types of team missions:^[1]^

- Assassination
- Delivery
- Massacre
- Source and Return

Mission progress and assigned CMDRs are displayed in Mission Details under the transactions tab. Unlike standard cargo missions, the delivery can be made via multiple runs.

## Team delivery mission

This mission type requires the player, and their teammates, to deliver a large quantity of cargo units from one station to another.^[1]^

- In order to accept the mission, one member of the team needs to access the mission board and select a team mission, which are denoted by a special icon.^[1]^

- Once accepted, the player who took the mission can share it by clicking the share button on the mission’s entry, located in the 'Transactions' panel. Doing so sends the player's teammates an inbox message and adds the mission to their own Transactions panel.^[1]^
- The teammates can choose to then either accept or decline the mission invite in the Transactions panel.^[1]^
- **Important to note:** each player can only share one mission at a time, this means that with a maximum of four players in a team, players can be part of up to a maximum of four active team missions at any given time.^[1]^

Players will be charged with transporting large quantities of goods from point A to point B. The Mission Depot allows members of a team to collect and deliver any amount of cargo that they require for the mission.^[1]^ 

The mission is completed when all the cargo has been delivered. Each team member is then able to collect their rewards.^[1]^ 

- All players who are members of the team at the point that the mission is completed are eligible for the mission rewards.^[1]^
- Every member of the team receives the same reward choices for completing the mission.^[1]^
- Team missions also use the new mission reward system, which provides players with three different, and roughly equivalent, reward packages allowing each player to choose which set of rewards they wish to claim. One of these reward packages will always be a credit based reward package.^[1]^
- The player who originally took the mission turns it in first, this enables the other team members to turn in the mission.
