**Community Goals** allow commanders to cooperate en masse to reshape the galaxy. These can be ongoing projects within star systems where commanders can collaborate or wage war. It requires travelling to a system with an active goal and join via the Mission Board. By joining it will show the objectives, participation and completion via the "Transactions" tab on the ship's left side panel.

## Overview

Before a player can contribute to a Community Goal, they must sign up for it in any Mission Board. Any contributions made at a Community Goal host station or megaship will not count towards the Community Goal if the contributor is not signed up. Each Community Goal has tiers. The more tiers achieved through the mission, the higher the reward; this usually means participants will receive more credits or a related bonus reward, but in some cases the tier will also determine the scale of the global reward. For example, in a CG that involves constructing five starports, building all five may require reaching tier 5.

Community Goals end when the highest tier listed has been reached or the time limit ends, whichever comes first. Some Community Goals, such as those involving two factions in a conflict, may have their maximum tiers set well beyond the community's ability to complete them in order to ensure that they run for the entirety of the time limit.

### Contributing

Depending on the type of CG, the method of making a contribution may differ.

## Rewards

CGs always reward a number of credits depending on the CG tier reached. Additional global and player rewards may be offered, and may be restricted to certain participation levels. Credits are usually distributed as soon as a CG completes or its time expires, while other rewards may be distributed on the first day following the CG's full week, or at later dates. Reward distribution does not occur for all players simultaneously, so some players may receive their rewards later than others. All player rewards are made available at the CG's host station.

If a player does not claim their CG rewards within two weeks, any credits they earned will be automatically added to their balance. Other rewards will remain available for pickup or transfer at the CG host station indefinitely.

### Player rewards

- Credits (based on the completion tier of the CG and the participation tier reached by the player)
