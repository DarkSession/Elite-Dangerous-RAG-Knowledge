Exploited system

**Pareco** is an independent system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It is an unusual system because the local starports and outposts all orbit a series of comets. As a result, these stations are all positioned within a thousand kilometers of each other and ships can travel between them in normal space in a reasonable amount of time.

## System Layout

- Pareco (T Tauri star)
    - Asire Dock (Outpost)
    - Crown Orbital (Orbis Starport)
    - Webb Station (Orbis Starport)
    - Phillips Market (Orbis Starport)
    - Garden Ring (Outpost)
    - Neville Ring (Orbis Starport)

## Notes

- The comets in Pareco are modelled by the Stellar Forge, but because no assets have been developed for comets in *Elite Dangerous* yet, they are not visible.
- The system has one star and no other celestial bodies (or no bigger ones if you count the comets). Still, it has hardly believable 2.125 billion people living in four Orbis stations and two Outposts. Known information does not state Orbis can host a giant population, rather on the contrary. Outposts are estimated at the maximum population of 150 000.
