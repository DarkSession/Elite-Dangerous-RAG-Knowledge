A Pack-Hound Missile
 		 	 

The Pack-Hound Missile Rack attempts to address the shortcomings of a conventional Seeker Missile Rack. The latter relies on a single, high-yield homing missile to strike a target, and these missiles can be destroyed by a Point Defence Turret or evaded by faster ships. The Pack-Hound, on the other hand, exchanges firepower for numbers in an attempt to overwhelm a target's defences. Each Pack-Hound salvo consists of four lower-strength homing missiles that follow erratic flight paths before closing the distance and converging on the target. Although a Point Defence Turret has a reasonable rate of success against a single, slow missile on a linear path, that rate falls significantly when dealing with four evasive missiles. Additionally, even though one Pack-Hound missile is weaker than a seeker missile, a full salvo inflicts greater damage.

The main drawback of the Pack-Hound Missile Rack, apart from the ineffectiveness against shields that all missile-based weapons suffer from, is its arming distance of 500 meters. If a salvo strikes a target within that range, it will deal significantly less damage. This means that a Pack-Hound user has to keep some distance from their target to maximise the weapon's effectiveness, which can make tracking and shooting at small, nimble targets more difficult. Additionally, unlike the Seeker Missile Rack, the Pack-Hound Missile Rack is only available as a Class 2 module.

An additional downside to the Pack Hound is a smaller splash radius on each individual missile. Standard Seeker Missiles have a very large explosion, capable of damaging multiple modules in a single hit, in some cases even damaging or destroying a target ship's entire bank of weapons. Pack Hounds, with a smaller radius, will tend to deal most of their damage to a single target module, accordingly requiring greater tactical skill to decide what module is the most important.

## Notes

- These missiles do explosive damage too, so when fighting with non-wing friendlies it is recommend to keep an eye on friendly position to avoid friendly fire.
- Sometimes the missiles will cluster together which can cause the detonation of one missile to destroy other missiles, causing little to no damage to the hull. Firing from a longer distance may help to prevent this issue, since the missiles will have more time to travel and avoid each other.
- Pack-Hound Missile Racks have fairly high heat generation compared to regular Missile Racks. Emptying two launchers at once can easily cause a ship's heat to reach 100%.
