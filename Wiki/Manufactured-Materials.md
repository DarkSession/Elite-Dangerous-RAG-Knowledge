## Manufactured Material Sources

Manufactured materials can be obtained from several sources:

### Ship Salvage

When you destroy a ship, it will drop components that you can collect with your cargo scoop. Some components are only available from certain types of ships:

- **Transport/Trading Ships:** Found in shipping lanes, and in signal sources.
- **Military and Authority Ships:** Found in all populated, non-Anarchy systems, ensuring security is maintained. In systems in War or Civil Unrest states, Conflict Zones will contain military and authority vessels.
- **Combat Ships:** Almost any hostile ship, such as pirates, can be considered a "combat ship". Found in most signal sources, and will have a 'Wanted' status.
- **Thargoid Interceptors and Scouts:** A source of various components of Thargoid origin. Found in Non-Human Signal Sources, AX Conflict Zones, systems experiencing an Incursion, and systems within the Pleiades Nebula and Witch Head Nebula.

In all cases, the highest grade materials will usually be dropped by bigger, more powerful, ships e.g. Type-9 Heavy, Anaconda, Imperial Cutter, and so on. The faction/origin of the ship does not seem to determine which manufactured resources a ship can drop, only the type and rarity; an Anaconda can drop Imperial Shielding and Core Dynamics Composites despite being a DeLacy design, for instance.

### Degraded Emissions

The most common type of signal source, found almost anywhere in populated space.

### Encoded Emissions

A common signal source type, found almost anywhere in populated space. Also a source of Encoded Materials.

### High Grade Emissions

A signal source type found in deep space, and the only source for some Very Rare manufactured materials.

### Combat Aftermath

A signal type found in Shipping Lanes and sphere of influence.

### Mission Reward

Some missions offer manufactured materials as part of the mission rewards. It is difficult to predict what missions are available at starports, let alone predict what material will be provided as a reward, so it is not recommended that you rely on these. Nevertheless, they are a useful way to acquire materials when not looking for specific material types.

## Notes

- Some manufactured materials are only available as mission rewards, or via trading at a Material Trader.
- The most effective way to get manufactured materials is to find High Grade Emissions and use the manufactured materials scavenged there to trade for other Manufactured Materials at a Material Trader.
