Recepta Conditivus

> 
> Extremophiles that are found exclusively on planets with atmospheres dominated by sulphur dioxide. Using a combination of inorganic and hydrocarbon materials, they build a shielding bubble. This allows them to create an isolated biome with regulated temperature and chemical composition. Growth is a difficult and complex process that requires careful melting, regrowing and freezing of the external shell so that the internal organism can develop. This is a gradual process, meaning that larger recepta are of significant age. Reproduction is also similarly complex and revolves around a budding process, which creates a smaller version of the adult. Once detached, it can roll under the action of gravity and air currents before coming to rest, where it will deploy a holdfast marking its final position.

**Recepta** are a species of alien organism found on planets and moons with thin atmospheres across the galaxy. They can be sampled with the Genetic Sampler and scanned with the Short Range Composition Scanner.

Recepta Conditivus - Red
 		 	 

### Description

*A recepta species where the body of the organism is suspended above ground inside a sphere-shaped translucent membrane. This is filled with chemical-rich ﬂuid that both protects the organism and provides the chemical soup needed for metabolism. Chemical exchange is controlled actively through the membrane and passively through the extensive root structure.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planet with thin Sulfur Dioxide atmosphere
- Icy or Rocky Ice planets
- Maximum gravity: 0.27

### Colored variants

Colored variant determined by rare material found on planet:

| MATERIAL | COLOR |
| --- | --- |
| Antinomy | Lime |
| Polonium | White |
| Ruthenium |  |
| Technetium |  |
| Tellurium | Cyan |
| Yttrium | Green |

## Recepta deltahedronix

Recepta Deltahedronix
 		 	 

### Description

*This species of recepta produces a thick lattice of trunks in a deltahedron shape. This grows around and above the globular central organism, and helps to capture, retain and focus geothermal heat for thermosynthesis.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planet with thin Sulfur Dioxide atmosphere
- Rocky or High Metal Content planets
- Maximum gravity: 0.27

### Colored variants

Colored variant determined by rare material found on planet:

| MATERIAL | COLOR |
| --- | --- |
| Cadmium | Lime |
| Mercury | Gold |
| Molybdenum | Orange |
| Niobium | Mulberry |
| Tungsten | Red |
| Tin |  |

Recepta Umbrux
 		 	 

### Description

*A recepta species that grows a thick latticed structure for protection. A fine translucent membrane stretches between its gaps, allowing sunlight to penetrate and reach the inner organism for photosynthesis.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planet with thin Sulfur Dioxide atmosphere
- Maximum gravity: 0.27
