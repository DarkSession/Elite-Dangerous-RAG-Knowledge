**Algreb Loren** was an esteemed Senator of the Empire and the father of Kahina Tijani Loren.^[1]^ Algreb and his family were killed in a rebellion in the Prism system in 3300. His daughter Kahina survived and she inherited her father's position as an Imperial Senator.^[1]^

## Biography

Algreb Loren was an esteemed Imperial Senator and a member of the Loren 'Lineage', an Imperial family distantly related to the ruling Duval Dynasty.^[2]^ He was married to his wife and had three daughters. Like many other Imperial families there was little interaction between him and his daughters other than at ceremonial events. His daughters were attended by slaves and they were planned to further his political allegiances via marriages.^[1]^

 As per tradition in the Loren lineage, Algreb ensured that his daughters were trained in sword play and hand to hand combat. Dark hair was seen as a sign of weakness in the Loren family. The middle daughter Tala had her genes modified with genetic engineering to alter her hair colour. Kahina refused this treatment which angered Algreb Loren.^[1]^

In 3297 Senator Algreb Loren forcefully annexed the Prism system due to discovery of sizable deposits of Tantalum. The demand had risen dramatically due to the change in hyperdrive technology. Prism had a peaceful agrarian culture until its annexation.^[1]^

Senator Algreb sanctioned the obliteration of the original colonists of the only habitable location in the Prism system, the water moon of Chione. This was carried out by Admiral Brice, commander of the Senator’s warfleet. Whilst noted by the Federation, the move was not challenged at the time.^[1]^

The entire Loren family later moved to Chione after the construction of a heavily fortified Imperial Palace on the island of New Ithaca in Chione’s southern hemisphere. A large refinery, built by Mastopolis Mining, was placed in orbit, known as Hiram’s Anchorage.^[1]^ 

Slaves on Chione were treated poorly, resulting in an uprising that was severely put down by Senator Algreb.^[1]^

A coup in 3300, led by these self-styled "Reclamists", led to the assassination of Senator Algreb, his wife, two daughters (Corine and Tala) and most of the household servants. It was assumed that his third daughter Kahina was killed too. However, Kahina survived and she inherited her father's political position. At 26, she became one of the youngest Senators in the Empire.^[1]^
