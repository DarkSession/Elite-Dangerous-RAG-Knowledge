> Delivered over vast distances by those in search of a profit, the Hutton Mug, is only sold to Commanders who make the painfully long journey to Hutton Orbital. Made from the salvaged frame shift drive plates of ships that ran out of fuel before reaching the station, this is purely a vanity item commemorating the epic journey. Its value lies in its rarity and latent frame shift energies keeping your drink that little bit warmer for the journey.

## Notes

- The Hutton Orbital Truckers, a player group, popularised the concept of the Hutton Mug, and are known to occasionally present "official" Hutton Mugs to *Elite Dangerous* players to commemorate milestones or humourous incidents. The group also has the rallying cry "For the Mug!", and has created a fictional disease known as "MODS" (Mug Ownership Deficiency Syndrome), which is used as a stand-in for COVID-19.
- The in-game Hutton Mug began as the winning submission in a community vote to add a new Rare Commodity.^[1]^ This led to a successful Community Goal that involved delivering Scrap to Hutton Orbital to start production of the item.^[2]^^[3]^
