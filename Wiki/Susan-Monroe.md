Elaine Boyd (Lover)

**Susan Monroe** was an agent of the Presidential Protection Detail who was assigned to Vice President Nigel Smeaton prior to his death. She was found murdered in her residence in August 3301, and the Federal Security Service came to suspect her lover, Federal Times reporter Elaine Boyd, was responsible. Boyd was found dead in Wyrd only days later, and various news feeds received data packages that detailed the suspicious deaths of key members of the investigations into the losses of the Highliner Antares and Starship One, including the late Vice President Nigel Smeaton, and identified Monroe, who had worked on Smeaton's protection detail, as Boyd's source.

## Timeline

15 MAR 3302

- Various media outlets throughout inhabited space received an anonymous communiqu√© this morning. "The galactic community is in peril," the message began. "They just don't know it yet." The transmission asserts a connection between Core Dynamics, the destruction of the Antares and Starship One, the Emperor's Dawn insurgency, and setbacks in Unknown Artefact research. It also claims that the deaths of Federal Vice-President Nigel Smeaton, Sean Richards, Arnold Lowe, Susan Monroe, Elaine Boyd, Emperor Hengist Duval and the disappearances of former Federal president Jasmina Halsey and Professor Ishmael Palin are similarly connected. The message concluded: "Many of those who have tried to connect these seemingly disparate events have been silenced, along with their sources. That is why I have chosen to remain anonymous. So far, only pawns have been revealed in this shadowy game. We must discover the king." Neither the Federation nor the Empire has chosen to comment on the transmission.

- In another shocking revelation the Federal Times today posted a story highlighting possible links between a non-exec member of the board of Core Dynamics and Vice President Nigel Smeaton's death. They first referenced an interview on January 28th with Congressman George Fallside who appeared to have early knowledge of the Vice President's death. The Congressman refused to comment on the article, but it is public knowledge of his non-executive directorship of Core Dynamics and several other major arms manufacturers. More damning was the evidence concerning one of the crew of the Starship One, Flight Engineer Nick Baron, who had previously worked at Core Dynamics before joining the President's Crew. From the information package sent by Elaine Boyd after her death, the Federal Times published extracts of financial records of the flight engineer. When tracing these records through a convoluted series of transfers, one of these transfers was through a shell corporation in which Congressman Fallside was involved. The trail of the payments revealed that Boyd must have obtained a high level clearance access, possibly provided by Agent Monroe. When asked about today's story, the Chief Editor for the Federal Times commented: "There does appear to have been a conspiracy on several levels. We believe that the destruction of the Highliner Antares so many years ago may not have been an accident. When the Vice President was investigating the death of his relative, he must have discovered some of these details, and possible the dark forces killed him, and when our reporter Elaine Boyd did the same, she too was silenced. We are still not clear how it relates to the present day. Our reporters continue to investigate. At the Federal Times we always seek the truth and we will discover the truth here."^[2]^

29 AUG 3301

- The Federal Times today revealed the latest article in their ongoing investigation into the apparent suicide of their reporter Elaine Boyd. They revealed that Agent Susan Monroe, who Boyd was accused of murdering, was part of Vice President Nigel Smeaton's protection detail at the time of his death. It already seemed obvious to many that Agent Monroe was the source of the reporter's information, but now there is greater likelihood that she provided it willingly. Officials from the Federal Security Service insist that Agent Monroe was an unwilling participant and they had evidence to link the agent's death to the reporter. The Chief Editor of the Federal Times responded by claiming this was 'nonsense' and that he would not rest until the truth was revealed.^[3]^

25 AUG 3301

- The hunt for Elaine Boyd ended today with the discovery of her body in a low-rent hotel in Wyrd. Local law enforcement reported that they received an anonymous tip-off about her location and discovered her body as they gained entry. The former reporter of the Federal Times was accused of murdering her partner, Agent Susan Monroe. An investigation into her death is already underway and agents from the Federal Security Service have been granted special access to assist the independent local police. The police have so far refused to provide any details, but an off-the-record source has revealed that a suicide note was found. It allegedly states that she could no longer live with the guilt of killing her lover. The Federal Times has so far refused to comment on the fate of their reporter.^[4]^

23 AUG 3301

- Following news of the brutal murder of Agent Susan Monroe, the Federal Security Services upgraded Elaine Boyd's person of interest status to 'suspect', and called for any information regarding the reporter's movements. "This was a particularly savage murder of a person who laid their life on the line. We believe that Elaine Boyd was using her lover to access confidential information. While we haven't yet ascertained the exact nature of the information she was trying to access or why she murdered the agent. It is also unknown whether Agent Monroe was a willing participant in the information retrieval, although we believe that her murder indicates that she was not. "We urge anybody who sees Elaine Boyd to report her location immediately. At this time she is considered dangerous and should not be approached." In a statement, the Chief Editor of the Federal Times said: "Having worked with Miss Boyd for seven years, I find it hard to imagine that she could commit the crime she is accused of. We are of course helping the security services with their inquiries, but I can confirm we have had no contact with Miss Boyd for several days."^[5]^

21 AUG 3301 

- The Federal Security Services today revealed that a member of the Presidential Protection Detail has been found dead in her home. "Agent Susan Monroe was killed in the early hours of this morning and there is evidence that her residence had been searched. At this time we do not know why, or if anything was taken. Her death was caused by several stab wounds to the chest and neck." When asked whether there were any suspects in the case, the spokeswoman responded: "We don't have a suspect at this stage and the investigation is progressing. We do want to speak with Elaine Boyd, who was romantically involved with Agent Monroe, and have identified her as a person of interest in the case. We urge her to contact us to help us with our investigation. If anyone knows the whereabouts of Elaine Boyd then they should inform us or their local law enforcement agency." Elaine Boyd is a reporter with the Federal Times, which refused to comment when asked about the reporter.^[6]^
