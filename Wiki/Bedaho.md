## Notes

- The Knowledge Base entry for Saud Kruger states that the corporation uses goldskin leather exclusively sourced from the planet Home in Bedaho in its ships' interiors, but there is no such planet in the system. It is possible that Home is an old name for the planet Matto, which is the only world in the system capable of supporting life.
