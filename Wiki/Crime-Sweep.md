A **Crime Sweep** is a Powerplay-related System Signal Source specific to Arissa Lavigny-Duval. It is similar to a Conflict Zone, but contains ships aligned to a Power battling against a system's defense forces. At these sites, the Power is trying to prepare the system for its expansion there by eliminating corrupt system security forces as a demonstration of Imperial justice. When aligned to Arissa Lavigny-Duval, pilots will receive 10 Powerplay (bonds) per ship killed at Crime Sweeps.

To locate a system with active Crime Sweeps, check the "Expansion" tab of Arissa Lavigny-Duval in the Galactic Powers menu.
