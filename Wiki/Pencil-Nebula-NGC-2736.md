Pencil Nebula (NGC 2736)
 		 	 

**NGC 2736**, also known as the **Pencil Nebula** due to its elongated shape, is a nebula in the Inner Orion Spur. It is 5 light-years long and 815 light-years from Sol, near Guardian space. It is just a small part of the Vela supernova remnant, the debris cloud, 100 light years across, of a star that exploded 11,000 years ago (the Vela Pulsar).^[1]^ An Asteroid Base, New Growth, services a terraforming planet in the closest system to the nebula, Pencil Sector EL-Y d5.

The Pencil Nebula moves at about 644,000 kilometers per hour (400,000 miles per hour).^[2]^
