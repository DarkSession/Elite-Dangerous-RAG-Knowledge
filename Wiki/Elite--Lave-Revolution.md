## Storyline

*AD 3174 - One man's world. AD 3265 - Not any more. Lave. A single planet, orbiting a dying star. For centuries, spacefarers have visited, docked at the space station and left, with no thought for the people on the planet below. Bad luck at cards means bad luck all round for Pietro Devander, who journeys half way across human controlled space to this ancient planet, whose name is barely remembered. What he finds is resistance. What it becomes, is revolution.^[1]^*
