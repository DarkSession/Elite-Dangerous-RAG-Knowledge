# Civil Servants
**Civil servants** or public servants are employees who work in the public sector for a government department or agency. The civil service mainly consists of bureaucrats who handle governmental affairs. They are hired on professional merit rather than appointed or elected. Their actions and duties are guided and determined by rules, regulations and budgetary specifications established by law or other higher authority.

## Alliance

In the Alliance, Civil Servants are salaried officials that look after the day to day running of the Alliance. They generally do not get involved in the political struggles. The Civil Servants mainly run the Alliance, because cultural differences among member systems means there's much disagreement between Councillors of the Alliance Assembly who rarely get anything done.^[1]^
