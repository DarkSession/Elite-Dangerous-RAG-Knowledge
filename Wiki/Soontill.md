**Soontill** is an uninhabited system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It is allegedly home to a planet of the same name that was discovered by The Dark Wheel and is said to be replete with countless Thargoid treasures. The brothers Neptune and Oberon Ryder, sons of The Dark Wheel's leader, Alex Ryder, were originally divided over whether to pursue Raxxla or Soontill and eventually discovered the latter.^[1]^^[2]^ Despite the location of the system Soontill being known and unrestricted, the planet's whereabouts remain a mystery to all but The Dark Wheel.

Objects taken from Soontill include slabs of unidentified material covered in pictographs of unknown origin.^[3]^ They are exclusively sold at Cheranovsky City in the Ngurii system as the Rare Commodity Soontill Relics. These alien artefacts were confirmed by Chief Xeno-Chemist Lyran Betar to not have been made by human hands and date back tens of thousands of years.^[4]^

## CIEP

 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Tourist Spot 0508
 		 	 

Tourist Spot 0508 above the first planet describes a base in the Soontill system where a secret Human-Thargoid project occurred*: "This is rumoured to be the site of the CIEP base. Some stories claim a combined Human-Thargoid project took place here."*^[5]^^[6]^ 

The acronym CIEP could mean Circle of Independent Elite Pilots, an offshoot of The Dark Wheel.^[7]^ They used it as a secret military base before being run off by pirates with fancy military technology. The location of Soontill was found by the pirates because it was close to Grandmort and the origin of the Circle attack force which traveled (out of their way) through Brohman and Lanaest to reach Delta Phoenicis.

The description (abbreviated from the description given by the pirate Robert Gary) upon entering the system is that of a pale purple Brown Dwarf 2AU (998ls) away with a large debris field and “space fog” with a planet hidden inside. That planet was supposedly turned into a volcanic mess by said pirate. This does not sound like the Soontill System listed in the UC database (well maybe the 4th planet).^[8]^

- Soontill Alien Artefacts to be Auctioned at Ngurii. Soontill is back in the news this week as fresh rumours have surfaced of alien items hitting the market in Ngurii.^[9]^

18 MAY 3301

- As further alien artefacts claiming to be from Soontill are being sold on the open market, the results of the initial scientific tests have been revealed. “We were looking for key markers,” explains Chief Xeno-Chemist Lyran Betar.  “Elemental make up, crystalline structure, anything that indicates it could have originated from human hand.” The research team’s results clearly state that no known human technology could have created the relics, yet they do not quite align with known Thargoid materials. Whatever they are, they are indeed very old, with isotopic dating indicating that they could well be tens of thousands of years old.^[4]^
