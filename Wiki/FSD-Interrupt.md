**FSD Interrupt** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to Missile Racks through Engineering. Missiles with this effect will disrupt a target ship's Frame Shift Drive and force it to reboot, delaying the target's ability to escape.  In exchange, the Missle Rack's damage and rate of fire are reduced.

The Containment Missile is a specialized variant of the Missile Rack that produces the same effect, but the reboots are longer in duration.

## Applicability

This effect is available to the following weapons:

- Missile Rack
- Containment Missile

On June 12, 2025 a two week long Community Goal started that will hand out (as a reward) medium and large Seeker Missile Racks pre-engineered with high-capacity and sturdy modifications plus FSD interrupt as experimental effect, making it the first time that FSD interrupt will be applied to Seeker Missiles^[1]^.
