The **Euryale Gaia Pilots Union (EGPU)**, commonly known as **EG Pilots**, are an independent faction founded and led by Dictator Yuri Grom, a former admiral of the Federal Navy. 

## History

The organisation began as a minor faction, the **EG Union**, which Grom formed with his loyalists in his home system of Euryale after he retired from the Federal Navy in protest of what he perceived as widespread corruption within the Federation. The EG Union eventually banded together with a number of other minor factions and individual pilots under the banner of the EG Pilots to expand Grom's influence in the Core Systems. In 3302, the EG Pilots emerged as the victor of the Dangerous Games, establishing their headquarters in Clayakarma, and Dictator Grom became the galaxy's 11th Power.

31 DEC 3307

- The last in a series that reviews the events of the past year, by noted historian Sima Kalhana.
"October brought further controversy for the Federation, when a diplomatic conference in the Delta Pavonis system was revealed to be a honey trap designed to capture Yuri Grom. Only a rush of support for EG Union allowed their ruler to escape, causing political embarrassment for President Hudson. There was more corporate drama when Zemina Torval relinquished her long-held majority sharehold of Mastopolos Mining, fuelling rumours of a family rift with her cousins. Torval Mining Ltd became a fully independent corporation run by her daughter Constantia. The Colonia Bridge project officially started the first of two phases this year which would see the construction of 56 megaships between the Alcor and Colonia systems. Brewer Corporation enjoyed great public support for improving this travel corridor along the 22,000 light year journey, and revealed plans to enhance it further in the new year. Hadrian Duval, his wife Lady Astrid and their unborn child were the specific targets of another starport bombing by the NMLA. It proved unsuccessful, but did result in the Imperial Senate offering them protection in order to secure the Duval bloodline. It also led to a manhunt for Theta Seven, the galaxy's most wanted terrorist. In November, Orion University claimed that the dredger occupied by the Scriveners Clan was legally their property, but the nomadic descendants of its original crew refused to give up their home. The stand-off caught the public attention, with some supporting the clan's right to independence and others keen to discover what their Knowledge Core contained. Ultimately the Scriveners retained their freedom, sailing off into the void with their secrets intact. Many were shocked when Admiral Tanner, Aegis's military chief, went rogue and tried to force access to a starport controlled by Salvation's allies. His conviction that the anti-xeno superweapons were responsible for provoking the Thargoids was, however, not enough to win the day. The NMLA threw everything they had at the Mudhrid system in an attempt to rescue Theta Seven, who was hiding among the Far God cult to avoid capture. But the terrorists were crushed by ACT and a coalition of ships, with Theta Seven martyring himself by destroying the hijacked megaship Sacrosanct. A happier event in December was the birth of Hector Duval, son and heir of Hadrian and Lady Astrid. There were celebrations across the Empire, but also questions asked about the future of the Duval dynasty and if the child might one day inherit the Imperial throne. The year ended as it had begun, with Thargoid vessels swarming into nebula systems. But with incursions steadily increasing over recent months, there were fears that this time they might prove unstoppable. Salvation's superweapons were once again deployed to halt the aliens' progress, but will they be enough to prevent the Thargoids from threatening humanity in 3308?"^[1]^

07 OCT 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
The battle between Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar and EG Union has concluded successfully for Yuri Grom's forces. Freelance war correspondent Karleen Troy reported via Vox Galactica: "For the past week, the Delta Pavonis system has been aflame with ship-to-ship engagements. But despite a fierce effort from Federal auxiliaries, EG Union was able to muster superior numbers. Eventually the Federal flagship, Freedom's Foundation, was boarded. I picked up comms chatter that described intense fighting before EG Union soldiers overran Federal troops. Since then I've learned that Yuri Grom has agreed to let the surviving crewmembers leave, but is claiming the megaship as 'spoils of war'." The following message was sent by Yuri Grom on public channels: "President Hudson has revealed his true nature as the corrupt heart of the Federation's rotting carcass. This treachery will not be forgotten." Pilots who supported Yuri Grom can collect their rewards from the Indomitable megaship. Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar confirmed that although the Freedom's Foundation is now under EG Union control, reimbursement for all Commanders who fought for Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar will be processed remotely by the 9th of October 3307.^[2]^

04 OCT 3307

- The Federal Diplomatic Corps has officially denounced President Hudson's attempt to capture Yuri Grom in the Delta Pavonis system. The political conference was to determine whether the system's ruling faction would ally with the EG Union or the Federation. It was abandoned when a Federal black ops team attempted to arrest Yuri Grom's delegation, triggering a conflict in the system. Ambassador Delphine Dumont told The Federal Times: "We have no option but to state that our own government has violated the conventions of diplomatic immunity. This conference was established in good faith with all parties. We were not informed that any hostile act against EG Union was planned. I offer my personal apologies to Yuri Grom. Our negotiations were spirited but honest, and I genuinely felt that progress was being made." This is the first time that the Federal Diplomatic Corps has distanced itself from the actions of a sitting president. Political observers believe that this is to maintain its reputation for integrity, especially in dealings with the Alliance and Empire. Public reaction in the Federation has been varied, with President Zachary Hudson being praised and criticised in equal measure. Insiders within his administration suggest that he is under enormous pressure to regain popularity, following the recent rebellion of several Federal systems.^[3]^

30 SEP 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
The Delta Pavonis political conference has erupted into conflict between EG Union and Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar. Yuri Grom, the ruler of EG Union, broadcast this message: "This conference was nothing more than a trap! My delegation was apprehended at gunpoint by a squad of undercover Federal agents. Sacrifices made by my loyal guards enabled us to escape from Kessler City, only to find our ships under attack. The Federation has declared war – I will respond in kind!" President Zachary Hudson gave an official statement: "Yuri Grom is a traitor and a dangerous threat to Federal security. We cannot ignore any opportunity to eliminate this ruthless tyrant." Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar has asked for Federal auxiliaries to provide combat support to its forces. In return, the EG Union called for help from "allies of Yuri Grom and enemies of the Federation". Grand Duke Simion Petrescu, the host of the political conference, has rejected claims that his faction was secretly working with the Federation to entrap Yuri Grom. The Federal Diplomatic Corps has not yet commented on its role in these events.^[4]^

24 SEP 3307

- Negotiations between the Federation and self-styled dictator Yuri Grom are underway to determine the Delta Pavonis system's allegiance. Political correspondent Conrad Sterling published an update for Vox Galactica: "In recent years, Yuri Grom has developed a degree of mystique. He was one of the few leaders not to attend the Galactic Summit, and news from within his dominion was scarce. But now he is visibly relishing the opportunity to confront Federal representatives under the protection of diplomatic immunity. Initial exchanges were belligerent as both sides argued over who would be the most beneficial partner. This was to be expected since Delta Pavonis is one of the Federation's founding systems, and it would be a significant coup for EG Union to establish a presence so close to Sol. What was unexpected was the mutual respect that gradually developed between Yuri Grom and Ambassador Delphine Dumont. Her charming manner clearly appealed to the dictator, even bringing forth his thunderous laughter on occasion. A deal is now being discussed that would allow the Autocracy of Delta Pavonis to have trade and political ties with both parties while remaining independent. Perhaps the Federation has learned some lessons from the recent rebellion, and perhaps Yuri Grom's hatred of the superpower he once served is finally abating."^[5]^

17 SEP 3307

- Delegations from the Federation and the dictator Yuri Grom are meeting to determine the Delta Pavonis system's future. Both are on a diplomatic mission to convince its controlling faction to either swear allegiance to Yuri Grom or become a Federal member state. Delta Pavonis was one of the original signatories of the Federal Accord in 2242, but has recently been governed by an independent autocracy. Yuri Grom himself is present, having arrived on the megaship Indomitable. Grom was once a respected admiral in the Federal Navy, before defecting with huge numbers of ships and followers. They established the independent EG Union, which he presides over as a military dictatorship. The rival delegation is led by Ambassador Delphine Dumont of the Federal Diplomatic Corps. They were transported on the Freedom's Foundation megaship courtesy of Delta Pavonis Galactic Interstellar, which formerly controlled the system. The ambassador invited newsfeeds to witness her initial introduction to Yuri Grom, who seemed slightly taken aback by her warm greeting. Grand Duke Simion Petrescu, ruler of the Autocracy of Delta Pavonis, told attending journalists: "The conference will take place in Kessler City on Reagan's Legacy, where our distinguished guests will enjoy our famous hospitality. I look forward to learning more about their respective proposals." This is the first time that the Federation has diplomatically engaged with Yuri Grom. Political observers noted that this tactful approach may be due to several Federal factions recently declaring independence.^[6]^

29 MAR 3304

- The EG Union has announced that its campaign to build a shipyard in CPC 20 6743 has received the wholehearted support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Lyakhov Dock, and by eliminating agitators in Ross 720 and surrounding systems, thereby ensuring the safety of traders. Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Lyakhov Dock in the CPC 20 6743 system.^[7]^

22 MAR 3304

- Yuri Grom has announced an initiative to create a new shipyard in the CPC 20 6743 system. The shipyard will produce capital ships with which to defend human space from both human and alien threats. The EG Union, acting on behalf of Yuri Grom, has placed an open order for various commodities to build the shipyard, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Lyakhov Dock in the CPC 20 6743 system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that pilots delivering commodities can do so safely. The spokesperson elaborated on the nature of the campaign: "Recent events have demonstrated that humanity is not prepared for a possible Thargoid invasion. Building a shipyard for Farragut-class ships is the first step in establishing a defensive perimeter. It is essential that traders do not encounter any difficulty when delivering materials, which is why the EG Pilots – Yuri Grom's elite task force – have been asked to eliminate any agitators. We are also asking independent combat pilots to help us neutralise any threats." The campaign begins on the 22nd of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.^[8]^

27 OCT 3302

- The Dangerous Games dominated headlines earlier this year, as some of galaxy's most powerful minor factions took part in a brutal battle for supremacy. After weeks of fierce competition involving hundreds of independent pilots, it was the EG Pilots who emerged victorious. Having spent the intervening months consolidating their assets, the EG Pilots are now ready to enter the galactic stage. Consequently, the temporary restriction on preparatory activity in systems within 30 light years of the Clayakarma, Nauo, Gyhldekala, Boga and Kpaniya systems – imposed by the United Research Council partly to allow the EG Pilots an opportunity to secure their position – has now been lifted. Like all powers, the organisation will seek the support of the galaxy's independent pilots, who will play a central role in its fate. Very little is known about the group's leader, Yuri Grom, although he is understood to have started his career in the Federal Navy, reaching the rank of Admiral before parting with the Federation and entering politics. Following a brief conflict in the Euryale system, in which Grom clashed with his former Federal allies, the ex-admiral emerged as the leader of his own independent power. Propaganda distributed by the EG Pilots offers a succinct description of Grom: "Yuri is idolized by his supporters and respected throughout his controlled systems. His support among the populace is absolute, his dominion unshakable." One thing is for sure – Grom's career, and the future of the EG Pilots, promises to be anything but boring.^[9]^

21 JUL 3302

- The third and final heat of the Rise to Power campaign is over. For this stage of the competition, pilots were asked to recover salvaged precious gems and deliver them to Laura Elizabeth in the Meropis system. Matters were complicated by the fact that the event organisers refused to reveal the precise whereabouts of the salvage site, giving just a single clue to its location. Once the location was found, a desperate race began as pilots urgently ferried the gems to the Laura Elizabeth starport in support of their chosen faction. Ultimately, it was the EG Pilots who received the most salvaged precious gems and claimed victory. But the celebrations were short-lived, as the EG Pilots waited tensely for the announcement of the overall victor. Now that the results of each heat have been reviewed, the event organisers have announced that the winner of the Rise to Power campaign is...the EG Pilots. Trinity Avon, reporting for The Sovereign, commented on what has proved to be an exciting competition: "The EG Pilots have shown that they has the necessary strength and influence to be recognised as a power in their own right. I for one look forward to seeing what the future holds."^[10]^

14 JUL 3302

- The second heat of the Rise to Power campaign is over. For this event, pilots were asked to head to the Nervi system and gather technical blueprints for their chosen faction. The one condition imposed on the pilots was that the technical blueprints must be stolen – a stipulation that gave rise to a number of clashes with Nervi security forces. The final tally indicates that the largest quantity of technical blueprints was received by the EG Pilots, making them the winner of this stage of the campaign. But whether or not the EG Pilots will win the Rise to Power competition remains to be seen, as it will not be clear which faction has received the most support until the end of the campaign. The Rise to Power competition will run for one more week, and the victor will go on to join the ranks of the galaxy's major power players.^[11]^

07 JUL 3302

- Last week saw the start of the Rise to Power competition, a three-week campaign to determine which of the galaxy's largest factions wields the greatest degree of power and influence. The winner of the competition will be in a position to compete with the galaxy's major power players. The first Rise to Power event required pilots to gather Gilya signature weapons for their chosen faction and deliver it to Gohar Station in the Jaradharre system. The week-long event saw plenty of conflict, with pilots doing everything in their power to disrupt their rivals' operations. The final tally indicates that the EG Pilots are the winner of the first Rise to Power heat, having received the largest quantity of Gilya signature weapons. But whether the EG Pilots will claim ultimate victory remains to be seen.^[12]^

30 JUN 3302

- For much of the past month, the galactic community has been captivated by the Dangerous Games, a semi-official competition organised by some of the galaxy's largest factions to determine which wields the greatest degree of power and influence. Three events have taken place so far, with pilots from across the galaxy fighting fervently to support their chosen group. With the 'Wildcard' stage of the competition over, it is time for the main event to begin. Trinity Avon, a reporter for The Sovereign, explained how the Rise to Power will work: "There are six factions taking part: the EG Pilots, the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps, the Border Coalition, GalCop, the Interstellar Communist Union and the Social Eleu Progressive Party. Over the next three weeks, there will be a series of campaigns in which each faction will try to rally as much support as possible. The faction that dominates its rivals will join the ranks of the galaxy's most powerful." The first Rise to Power event requires pilots to gather Gilya signature weapons for their chosen faction and deliver them to Gohar Station in the Jaradharre system. The faction that accumulates the most Gilya signature weapons will be declared the winner of the first heat. The event begins on the 30th of June 3302 and will run for one week.^[13]^

23 JUN 3302

- The third and final heat of the Dangerous Games Wildcard competition is over. For this stage of the competition, pilots were asked to fill their cargo holds with conductive fabrics and deliver them to Tartarus Point for their chosen faction. Hundreds of pilots participated in the event, eager to help their faction secure a place in the Dangerous Games. But ultimately it was the EG Pilots that accumulated the most conductive fabrics and once again claimed victory. With the competition over, the results of each heat have been reviewed to determine which faction received the most support over the course of the campaign. The final result indicates that the winner of the Dangerous Games Wildcard competition is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the EG Pilots. The EG Pilots will now enter the Dangerous Games, competing with the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps, the Border Coalition, GalCop, the Interstellar Communist Union and the Social Eleu Progressive Party for the right to join the ranks of the galaxy's most powerful. Trinity Avon, a reporter for The Sovereign, commented on what has proved to be a dramatic competition: "Each faction has enjoyed its share of success, but ultimately there could be only one winner. The EG Pilots have proved they can attract considerable support, but does that mean they can go toe to toe with the likes of the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps and the Social Eleu Progressive Party? Only time will tell." The Dangerous Games will begin on the 30th of June.^[14]^

16 JUN 3302

- The second heat of the Dangerous Games Wildcard competition is over. For this event, pilots were asked to deploy their hardpoints and gather bounties for their chosen faction in the Bjorti system. The group that accumulated the most bounty vouchers during the week-long event would be declared the winner. The final tally indicates that victory goes once again to the EG Pilots, which received the largest amount of bounty vouchers. Whether or not the EG Pilots will win the Wildcard competition remains to be seen, as it will not be clear which faction has received the most support until the end of the campaign. The Dangerous Games Wildcard competition will run for a total of three weeks, and the victor will go on to vie for the right to be recognised as an official power.^[15]^

09 JUN 3302

- Last week saw the start of a three-week campaign to determine which of the galaxy's minor factions would earn a place in the forthcoming Dangerous Games. The victor of the so-called 'Wildcard' competition will go on to vie for the right to be recognised as an official power. The first Wildcard event required pilots to fire up their mining lasers and gather gold for their chosen faction. Predictably, the week-long event saw no small measure of conflict, with pilots doing everything they could to disrupt their rivals' operations. The final tally indicates that the EG Pilots received the largest quantity of gold. But whether or not this will result in ultimate victory remains to be seen, as it will not be clear which faction has received the most support until the end of the three-week campaign.^[16]^

## Notes

- The EG Pilots were originally a player group comprised predominately of Russian speaking *Elite Dangerous* players. Their associated player minor faction is the EG Union, based in Euryale.
- On July 26, 2019, the EG Pilots announced they would cease active support of Yuri Grom.^[17]^
