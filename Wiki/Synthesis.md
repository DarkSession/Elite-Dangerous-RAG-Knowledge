# Synthesis
**Synthesis** is a mechanism by which different Materials can be combined to quickly create ammunition or resource refills for various modules. Synthesis recipes can be accessed in the Inventory tab of the right HUD panel, or via the Modules tab by selecting a specific module. Most Synthesis recipes have three variants: Basic, Standard, and Premium. The Standard and Premium variants often feature beneficial bonus effects, but have greater Material requirements than the Basic recipe.
