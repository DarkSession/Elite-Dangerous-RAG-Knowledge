# Fleet Carrier Outfitting Service
Optional Service: Outfitting

For any and all purchases the credits will be taken from the Carrier balance, not the commander personal balance.

 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 	 

Installation cost: 250.000.000 CR

Active Service maintenance: 5.000.000 CR / week

Suspended maintenance: 1.500.000 CR / week

Refund amount if service is removed: FULL refund. (Does not include already payed maintenance fees)

If the service is suspended before the weekly payment, the amount owed will correspond to the Suspended amount instead of the full amount, even if the service was active all week. You can dodge the week maintenance fees by removing the service completely before the week payment, since you get a full refund of the service installation cost.

When the carrier is in the system that allows for it, the owner may purchase bundles of ships to sell on board. Only bundles can be bought, not single ships. Each bundle has its own price, ships and cargo space requirements. The cargo space requirement is the same used by commodities, this makes a carrier jump more expensive the more services and or ships for sale you have on board.

Similar to the Fleet Carrier Shipyard, the modules are only purchasable in bulk. The modules are divided in 3 Tiers of "Outfitting Stocks" for each category, and they are divided in 19 categories.
