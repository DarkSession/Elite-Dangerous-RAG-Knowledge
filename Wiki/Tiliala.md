## History

On November 11, 3303, an independent organisation based out of the Varpet system called The Black Fleet ousted the Conservatives of Tiliala from power in the Tiliala system. This was a significant development because entry to Tiliala required a permit, the distribution of which had been controlled solely by the Conservatives of Tiliala up to that point. The Black Fleet's victory forced the Conservatives of Tiliala to share the permit distribution rights. With their presence in Tiliala dramatically reduced, the Conservatives of Tiliala relocated to the Wells-class Carrier Tiliala's Lament in the Akandinigua system, and made arrangements with various corporate and political partners to ensure that the new megaship remained permanently in their control.^[1]^ The Black Fleet's dominance did not last for long, however. Its influence in Tiliala rapidly declined in June 3304 as other minor factions suddenly flourished, and it was subsequently ejected from the system entirely in late July 3304.

The Conservatives of Tiliala faction was one of 14 permit-holding factions that entered into an agreement on November 24, 3307 to maintain so-called Gatekeeper megaships to preserve interstellar trade regardless of local political shifts. These Gatekeeper megaships would be permanently stationed in systems adjacent to their corresponding permit-locked systems to ensure that pilots could reliably obtain permits. The megaship Tiliala's Lament was retroactively included in the agreement.^[2]^
