An **Impact Site** is a type of Point of Interest that can be detected from orbit and accessed while On Foot or in a SRV.

## Contents

Threat level 1 Impact Sites contain a crashed satellite that has fallen from orbit. Maintenance panels on the satellite can be cut open with the Arc Cutter to scavenge Components. Data or a Data Point Intel Package can be downloaded from the upper portion of the satellite.

Threat level 2 Impact Sites contain a crashed Nav Beacon with maintenance panels and a data port. They may or may not be guarded by a faction. Threat level 2 Impact Sites seem to be easier to find in systems that are in Conflict states (War/Civil War).

Threat level 3 Impact Sites contain a crashed satellite that is guarded by five criminals.

## Spawn Locations

## Notes

- Impact Sites were introduced in *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*. The sites and some of the data point gameplay are also implemented in Horizons.
