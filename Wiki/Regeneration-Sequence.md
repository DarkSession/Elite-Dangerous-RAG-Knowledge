# Regeneration Sequence
**Regeneration Sequence** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to Beam Lasers through Engineering. It is a Friend or Foe Beam modulation upgrade. When the beam strikes a wingmans shield its energy is regulated, regenerating the shield instead of damaging it. Applying this secondary effect decreases the damage by 10%.

## Applicability

This effect is available to the following weapons:

- Beam Laser

## Required Materials

- 3x Refined Focus Crystals
- 4x Shielding Sensors
- 1x Peculiar Shield Frequency Data
