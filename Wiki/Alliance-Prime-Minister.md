## Responsibilities

Alliance leadership is a complex interlocking of systems, committees, and power-sharing which some see as a limit on the Prime Minister's influence.^[1]^ The Prime Minister is elected by the Councillors of the Alliance Assembly. It is the Prime Minister's job to corral them into some sort of consensus, which is generally a slow process; due to the Alliance's considerable cultural variation, the Alliance Assembly rarely gets anything done. As a result, real power rests with the Civil Servants and the Council of Admirals.^[2]^

From the founding of the Alliance in 3230, the Alliance Prime Minister served as the head of government, while the head of state was a separate position: President of the Alliance. The Prime Minister wielded significantly more power than the largely ceremonial presidency.^[3]^^[4]^ In June 3305, following the removal of President Gibson Kincaid from office for masterminding a treasonous conspiracy to transfer executive power to the presidency and establish himself as the supreme ruler of the Alliance, the Alliance Assembly approved a constitutional change that abolished the office of Alliance President.^[5]^ The role of the Alliance's head of state presumably devolved to the Alliance Prime Minister.

## Tenure

The Alliance Prime Minister is elected by the Alliance Assembly for a term of six years, and there is no limit to how many terms they can serve. In practice, however, disputes within the Assembly mean that any given Prime Minister usually does not complete their first term. Prime Ministers who suffer a defeat on a key proposal often resign, or are forced out of office by a vote of no confidence. Since the formation of the Alliance in 3230, only one Prime Minister has been reelected to a second term.^[2]^ Only a plurality of votes from the Assembly's Councillors is necessary for a candidate to win an election and become Prime Minister.^[6]^ It has been suggested that the Alliance's electoral system should be overhauled to allow Alliance citizens to vote directly in elections for Prime Minister, but the logistical hurdles of organising public voting across the entire Alliance, including in non-democratic member systems, are considered formidable.^[7]^

The incumbent Alliance Prime Minister, Edmund Mahon, was first elected to office in early 3301; the earliest mention of Mahon serving as Prime Minister was on March 11, 3301, when he announced that the Alliance would not intervene on behalf of the Crimson State Group in the War for Lugh.^[8]^ With his first term set to expire in 3307,^[9]^ Mahon began preparing for a reelection campaign in late 3306, and Councillor Nakato Kaine of Tionisla emerged as his foremost opponent among multiple challengers.^[10]^ The election was originally scheduled for February 25, 3307,^[11]^ but the Alliance Assembly narrowly approved a delay to May 27, 3307 at Mahon's request to avoid conflicting with the Galactic Summit.^[12]^^[13]^ The decision effectively prolonged Mahon's term by three months, and was met with protests across many Allied worlds.^[14]^ By May 17, Mahon still retained majority approval in opinion polls, but the margin had tightened since his move to delay the election.^[15]^ Even with that slip in support, pundits began asserting as early as May 20 that Mahon's victory was all but certain,^[16]^ and opinion polls published on election day supported this conclusion while acknowledging that Kaine had built up broad support for her policies.^[17]^ On May 28, 3307, it was officially confirmed that Edmund Mahon had won an unprecedented second term in office as prime minister by a plurality vote of the Assembly.^[6]^
