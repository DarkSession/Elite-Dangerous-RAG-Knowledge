### Jameson Memorial Starport Operational

**The famous megamarket Jameson Memorial is once again fully operational.**

A recent Thargoid incursion into Shinrarta Dezhra caught AX forces by surprise, overwhelming the system and knocking most ports offline. Only Jameson Memorial resisted as large numbers of independent pilots flocked to the defensive campaign.

Florian Baljak, now officially installed as the starport commander for Jameson Memorial, offered this statement:

“*I am overwhelmed by the response to the recovery initiative for offline ports. The flow of resources and commodities to this great system reflects the importance that Jameson Memorial holds in the eyes of our pilots*.”

The Pilots’ Federation has confirmed the loss of over 1,600 licensed Commanders and Rescue Rangers during the attack. The initial resistance to the Thargoid fleet was upheld by these pilots until reinforcements arrived. Shinrarta Dezhra is the home of the elite pilot organization, with its headquarters situated on Founders World.

Several military sources have mentioned that the Thargoid attack fleet in Shinrarta Dezhra was far larger than a typical system invasion force. The Thargoids suffered considerable losses as the conflict wore on, with confirmed Thargoid Scout kills noted as "particularly high".

All services previously found at Jameson Memorial are now available for pilots with access to the system. The Shinrarta Dezhra temporary access permit granted to pilots will expire on Thursday 3rd October.

### Zorgon Peterson Event Reveals New Exploration Vessel

**Zorgon Peterson has delighted fans and investors alike with the confirmation of its first new vessel in six years.**

At an extravagant launch party, the Mandalay was introduced to an enthusiastic reception. Presented as an exploration-focused vessel, Zorgon Peterson chief marketing officer Devin Kaneda provided the following details:

“*With the Mamba, Zorgon Peterson’s team showed we can match all other manufacturers in terms of speed. With the Fer-de-Lance, we demonstrated our understanding of excellent military design. Now, with the Mandalay, we aim to provide consumers with a premium exploration option*.”

“*Our design division has focused on specific performance advantages once again. The Mandalay brings a significant jump range for a medium-sized vessel. Careful attention has also been placed on improving ship handling in atmospheric environments*.”

“*We’ve also listened to explorers regarding quality-of-life features. Therefore, the disembark platform is forward-facing, strong landing-mode illumination acts as a beacon during journeys of discovery. Structural support for SCO frame shift drives is also included as standard*.”

Early reviews have complimented the design, performance, and aesthetics of Zorgon Peterson’s latest release. It is believed that Faulcon DeLacy management are extremely impressed with the launch event and are optimistic for the vessel’s market performance.

The Mandalay is expected to be available for public purchase soon.

### Thargoid Titan Wreckage ‘Could Accelerate Multiple Scientific Fields’

**Aegis scientists have recently held a public forum to discuss ongoing research into the wreckage left behind by Thargoid Titans.**

The Xenological Science Symposium on Procyon B 7 discussed topics including technological advances made since the start of the Second Thargoid War, their potential application to non-military industries, and hypothetical future-tech in the event of victory against the Thargoid invasion force.

Keynote speaker Professor Shamus Madigan, part of the Federal delegation to the Aegis Initiative, chose to discuss the Thargoid Titan wreckage and potential advancements from the components thus far recovered from them.

“*Obviously, we’ve seen huge strides in human aerospace technology with the SCO frame shift drive. Achilles Aerospace has delivered a marvellous device which greatly amplifies the travel speeds of small spacecraft within a star system*.”

“*But the reality is that the scientific community is exploring further applications of this xeno material. For example, the Titans design has mastered thermodynamic efficiency. The exchange of energy to power while distributing heat away from core components is so effective it has essentially redrawn the map of our understanding*.”

“*If we can harness this efficiency into large-scale manufacturing, say, it’ll offer so many opportunities. Industrial installations could work harder and faster without compromising safety. Raw resources processed into finished products at higher rates could reduce consumer costs and increase accessibility*.”

“I*t’s quite an exciting time for research, industry and corporations of all sizes*.”

### The Assault on Raijin

**\*Pilots’ Federation Alert\***

Titan Raijin is under siege. This is an urgent call to all independent pilots to aid in the complete defeat of the seventh Titan.

The key modules for the assault continue to be readily available at all Rescue Megaships:

- Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser – To break through the maelstrom defence wave.

- Caustic Sink Launchers – To protect your ship from caustic effects of the maelstrom.

- Guardian Nanite Torpedo Pylon – To hamper the Titan’s vents and make it vulnerable to damage.

Rewards have been requisitioned for all Commanders able to participate in ending the Titan threat.

Good luck, Commanders.

### 'Significant Medical Emergency’ Strikes Seo Jin-ae

**Seo Jin-ae, special advisor to the Aegis initiative, has suffered a ‘significant medical emergency’ according to reports from the Duamta system.**

A leak from within the Aegis medical facility reached media outlets early yesterday evening, claiming that Seo had suddenly fallen ill. The source also claimed that Seo was registering incredibly high brain activity while unconscious.

The intense speculation resulted in a surprise response from Head of Aegis, Alba Tesreau, only hours later.

Her brief statement was delivered by a spokesperson outside the facility to gathered journalists:

“*While it is unfortunate that a member of our staff decided to leak this information, the news is true. I have chosen to confirm the claims myself, rather than let speculation and falsehoods grow about Seo’s condition*.”

“*Approximately sixteen hours ago, Seo experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The convulsions stopped within a few minutes, but she is yet to wake. Aegis medical experts are providing the best possible care as they determine the cause of this episode*.”

“*Until then, please allow the staff here to do what they do best without distraction from those hungry for information. We will provide an update on Seo when there is something to share*.”

Seo is known for her unique ability to interpret Thargoid communications, due to a prototype cortical implant installed during the Project Seraph experiments. It is believed that her insight has proven highly valuable to Aegis tactical briefings, but Seo’s level of involvement has never been fully detailed.

### Torben Rademaker Demands ‘Disconnection’ of Seo Jin-ae

**Azimuth Biotech CEO Torben Rademaker has claimed that Seo Jin-ae's current medical situation is ‘dangerous’ for humanity.**

Last week, Aegis’ special advisor Seo fell into a coma following a violent seizure. Head of Aegis Alba Tesreau confirmed the incident shortly afterwards, stating that Seo was receiving the best possible care at an Aegis medical facility.

Following a request for comment statement by Vox Galactica’s Conrad Sterling, Rademaker discussed his views on the latest developments in the Thargoid war and the status of Seo:

“*The original whistleblower of this tragic event did everybody a huge favour. No doubt Aegis would have hidden the truth otherwise, as the initiative has done so many times over the years*.”

“*One thing I noticed from Ms. Tesreau’s statement was the lack of any reference to the ‘incredibly high brain activity’ mentioned by the whistleblower. Surely if this detail were incorrect, it would have been refuted. Instead, it was ignored. Isn’t that strange, Conrad?*”

“*I can only conclude that the link Seo possesses to the Thargoid hive mind is active in ways we cannot comprehend. And that is a danger we simply must not permit. I call on Aegis to do the right thing and disconnect Seo Jin-ae from whatever external force has control of her. By any means necessary*.”

When called for a response, an Aegis spokesperson simply mentioned that Rademaker’s comments were ‘characteristically insensitive.’ The latest update on Seo’s condition suggests she is currently stable but remains unconscious.

### Seo Jin-ae Awake, Releases Unauthorised Warning

**Reports that Aegis special advisor Seo Jin-ae has woken from a week-long coma were followed by a statement by Seo, which was sent to all major newsfeeds.**

Aegis medical personnel had confirmed earlier in the day that Seo had abruptly woken from unconsciousness, following a significant seizure on October 18th. There were no long-term physical concerns, and she was expected to make a full recovery.

However, less than two hours later, Seo released a statement via ICE-cast. The raw footage was self-recorded and is believed to have been made without Aegis command’s authorisation.

“*I hate making these public announcements, so don’t expect it to be good*”, she explained. “*But everyone keeps telling me how important I am to the war effort, so why not test that and see if anyone listens? There’s something everybody needs to know. What happened to me wasn’t an accident or an illness*.”

“*Right before I passed out there was a noise in my head. It was like someone plugged an amplifier straight into my brain. I couldn’t stop it, and it hurt like you wouldn’t believe. It’s still echoing in my skull somewhere. But more than that, I could feel it. Moving through my consciousness*.”

“*My memories rushed past me in a blur. I couldn’t stop it. It felt like everything I’ve ever known, learned or whatever... Just spinning and spinning around. Even in a coma, I could feel it. The Thargoids had finally noticed my presence and tried to learn what they could about me – which also means everything I know about humans. They scraped it out of my mind. I’m sorry that I couldn’t stop it. I’m sorry*.”

“*But I can still hear the Thargoid mind. I guess they’re done with me. They’re planning something now. Listen to Aegis – they'll do everything they can to fix this*.”

Ivano Colombera, the Imperial research lead for the Aegis project, has speculated that the cortical implant which grants Seo the ability to hear the Thargoid hive mind may have disrupted an attempt to control her like a drone. No other statement from Aegis has yet been made.

### Thargoid War Bulletin: The Last Mothership

**Titan Raijin in the Pegasi Sector IH-U b3-3 system has been destroyed, leaving only Cocijo still operational.**

Aden Tanner, anti-xeno strategist for Aegis, provided a brief statement:

“*My heart still soars to hear that another Titan has been taken down. Until very recently, these colossal constructs were seen as indestructible. Aegis was even drawing up long-term strategies based around them being permanently present in human space. The Guardian nanite torpedo, and the hard work of so many pilots, has made that academic*.”

“*Anti-xeno pilots are already travelling to the systems surrounding Col 285 Sector BA-P c6-18, to repeat the process one last time on Titan Cocijo. With such a concentrated effort, it is not expected to last long. However, I must repeat my earlier call for caution and preparedness. We cannot tell how the Thargoids will respond to the loss of their last mothership, and we may face unknown weaponry or tactics*.”

### Famed Treasure Hunter Herman Colt Missing

**A prominent figure in the treasure hunting community has gone missing, prompting speculation as to his fate.**

Herman Colt, known for recovering several notable historical artefacts across the core systems, departed the Frenis system three weeks ago along with several other pilots. It is believed Colt’s latest expedition sought the final treasure hoard of Captain Morrigan, a fearsome pirate active in the mid-3200's.

Rewired spoke to a colleague of Colt’s, Natasha Moore, for an insight into Colt’s whereabouts:

“*It’s unlike Colt to maintain radio silence during an expedition. In fact, it's fair to say he loves the attention. Each new expedition generates buzz among the exploration community, with dozens of pilots begging to be taken along for the adventure*.”

“*Colt has a soft spot for Captain Morrigan – I think he’s already got some bits and pieces from her life on display at his home. I know he was excited about this trip, and the chance to find Morrigan’s final treasure stash. But typically Colt would have sent me an update by now. Hopefully he’s just having too much fun on his latest voyage*.”

Captain Morrigan was known for a series of daring raids between 3253-3261, with her gang often overpowering significantly larger forces to steal cargo from trade convoys in and around Frenis. Her most significant rivals belonged to the Candira gang, and firefights between the two groups were common. Morrigan was last sighted in 3265, and it is believed she died in action around this time.

### Mandalay Released: Zorgon Peterson’s SCO-Friendly Explorer Ships Out

**The first run of Mandalay ships has been delivered to shipyards across the core systems and are now available for purchase.**

Zorgon Peterson’s Mandalay is the third new vessel to be optimised for Achilles Aerospace’s SCO frame shift drive – following the Python Mk. II and the Type-8 - and aims to become the premier medium-sized exploration craft.

Chief Marketing Officer Devin Kaneda sent a press statement to all shipyard outlets:

“*The Mandalay allows pilots to achieve a considerable jump range while maintaining the manoeuverability of its size class, expanding the range of future exploration voyages of its size class. Our technicians have ensured that the ship’s handling in atmospheric conditions is exceptional, easing the travel down to undiscovered worlds*.”

“*A rethink of structural stress resistance, in cooperation with Achilles engineers, has resulted in the Mandalay taking full advantage of the SCO frame shift drive. We believe this vessel is an exceptional package for pilots who wish to explore the galaxy efficiently, comfortably and in style*.”

Notable at the Mandalay’s release party was the lack of a representative of Sirius Corporation. Rumours of an ongoing disagreement between representatives and Zorgon Peterson management over Achilles’ design input have grown in volume in recent weeks.

### President Winters Assumes Office

**The inauguration ceremony has taken place to formally swear in Felicia Winters as the president of the Federation.**

President Winters made a public address from the White House in Olympus Village on Mars:

“*I pledge to work for the benefit of each and every individual within our Federation. My administration will redirect funding away from corporations toward improving health, public services and quality of life. Together, we will launch a new era of optimism and opportunity!*”

“*My first act is to order the Federal Intelligence Agency to shut down the Proactive Detection Bureau. The illegal surveillance of all communication ends now. We will propose to Congress that the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act of 3307 is revoked, allowing our Federal Accord to uphold each citizen’s constitutional right to privacy*.”

The presidential election was held in October 3309, when Felicia Winters eclipsed her rival Jerome Archer by four per cent of the vote. Her inauguration was delayed for a number of reasons, including the personal tragedy affecting the Winters family after disastrous earthquakes on Rhea 3.

President Winters is supported by Vice President Isolde Rochester, matriarch of the famous Rochester family. The Liberal Party will now form a new Federal government, led by a hand-picked Cabinet. This includes Congressmen Kristine Lasky as Secretary of State, Conn Montgomery as Secretary for Defence, Bai Zheng as Secretary for Security, and Pierre-Marc Pelletier as Grand Attorney.

Former President Zachary Hudson has officially vacated the office, having served since 3301. His successor, Shadow President Jerome Archer, will now lead the Republican Party as the opposition.
