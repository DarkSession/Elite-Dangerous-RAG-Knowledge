GalCop

**Unit 01** is the designation of an apparently fully sentient/sapient artificial intelligence that holds some kind of connection to Project Thunderchild, a secret (possibly anti-Thargoid) Elite team that existed around the time of the Galactic Cooperative of World's (GalCop) collapse. 

Judging from its response through the Listening Post around Jotunheim 7 a, it's apparent purpose, or perhaps one of it programed tasks, to monitor Project Equinox and relay any Thargoid-related findings to GalCop authorities. Sometime mid-3303, when news activity regarding Thargoids started crisscrossing the bubble, a signal from IC 4604 Sector FB-X c1-16 started broadcasting and was received by Project Thunderchild Unit 01. A subroutine was triggered within it, revealing a code within that contained a small data packet that further contained various overlapping signals regarding the work of a Dr. Calvin, of Project Equinox. 

The packet ultimately lead Commanders to discover the still functioning GCS Sarasvati mega ship, the last remnant of GalCop, within the currently named Sheron system (formerly the  IC NEBULA 4604 FB-X C1-16 system). There, an encoded transmission, from one Julian Lyons of the Thunderchild team, was found. Apparently intended for Unit 01, heavily implicating an important mission for the AI at some point in the future. Unit 01's subroutine appears to have functioned exactly as intended, to some degree, but was unaware that GalCop had ceased to exist over a century before, and it is unknown what has become of Unit 01 since the signals reactivation prior to September 27, 3303. ^[1]^

Given that it is a well known fact that AI's are illegal in all spaces, and that there have been two massive incursions by the Thargoids into the bubble at this point in time, it is unknown if Unit 01's supposed mission was a success or failure ultimately. Or if it has yet to enact it.
