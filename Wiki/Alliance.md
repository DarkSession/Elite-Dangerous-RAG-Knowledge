The **Alliance**, officially the **Alliance of Independent Systems**, is a galactic superpower and a parliamentary democracy. It is the third largest major faction in the galaxy. Its historic and political center is the system of Alioth; Garden City on Turner's World, close to the old industrial and ship-building city of New Rossyth, is the seat of the Alliance government.^[2]^

The Alliance was established in 3230 in Alioth, and portrays itself as a beacon of human rights and democracy in an increasingly autocratic universe. It rejects the rigid hierarchy of the Empire and the extreme capitalism of the Federation, opting instead for a voluntary political association focused on the mutual prosperity of its members. However, the decentralized nature of this approach means that the Alliance's many member systems, represented by their respective Councillors on the Alliance Assembly, often struggle to come to an agreement on anything. The Alliance is led by the Alliance Prime Minister, who is elected by and heads the Alliance Assembly. The current Alliance Prime Minister is Edmund Mahon.

The independent systems that formed the Alliance also sought to defend against the encroachment of the other two superpowers through military cooperation and mutual defense. On this front, the Alliance is more cohesive, and each member system contributes a portion of its navy to the Alliance Defence Force. The Alliance Assembly appoints the leaders of the ADF's six largest fleets to the Council of Admirals, which heads the entire ADF and has the power to act swiftly without prior approval from the Assembly. Vessels of the ADF generally bear the decals of their own navies, but display an additional decal specific to the ADF while operating under its umbrella.

## History

### Born from conflict

Donaldson and Turner's World. The birthplace of the Alliance of Independent Systems, the spindle of the first of the system's three huge Orbis Stations is in orbit of Turner's World (Alioth 5B)
 		 	 

    - *Main article: Alioth*

The Alliance may champion the ideals of harmony and independence, but it is very much the product of violence. Alioth, the Alliance powerbase, was once a highly contested system. In the decades that followed its colonisation, it was the site of almost constant conflict between the Federation and the Empire. Naturally this made life difficult for the system's inhabitants, whose lives were impacted by generation after generation of war.^[3]^

The turning point came in 3228, when the Federal corporations supplying one of Alioth's main population centres attempted to raise prices. This triggered a revolt. Federal and Imperial forces were dispatched to quell the uprising, but the resistance, bolstered by fighters from neighbouring independent systems, successfully repelled them. Ultimately the Empire chose to withdraw from the system, reluctant to commit to a potentially protracted campaign far from its centre of power. When the Federation realised how unpopular the war had become among Federal citizens, it followed suit.^[3]^

### A third superpower

Mic Turner and his life-long partner Meredith Argent were the first to propose a safe political unit for those who wished to exist outside the protection of the Federation or the constraints of the Empire. They were the main driving force behind the creation of the Alliance.

In the wake of the uprising, the idea of an independent socio-political body rapidly gained popularity among the people of Alioth and in 3230, the Alliance of Independent Systems was established. Its founding principles were simple: to protect and support those who wanted to remain independent of the Federation and the Empire, and to empower its member systems while simultaneously preserving their independence. Over the next two decades, more than twenty systems joined the Alliance.^[3]^ Some of these early member systems were independent, while others revolted from Imperial and Federal control. For nearly a thousand years, colonial settlements could only choose between Imperial tyranny or Federal interference. Alioth and the Alliance provided a third way, more supportive and less conditional on cultural alignment.^[4]^

### Recent events

#### 3300 - 3305

In December 3300, the Alliance was the only one of the three superpowers to not face a mounting political crisis. The Empire seemed likely to plunge into a bitter succession struggle as Emperor Hengist Duval's health waned, and President Jasmina Halsey Federation was rapidly losing clout in Federal Congress over her unpopular policies. A junior aide in Alliance leadership also commented that the concurrent sharp rise in military readiness in the other superpowers could signal war and millions of deaths, and the Alliance could do nothing but broker peace talks in the aftermath.^[5]^^[6]^

The Alliance Assembly elected Edmund Mahon to the post of Alliance Prime Minister in early 3301.^[7]^ One of Mahon's first official acts was to reject a request from the Crimson State Group of Lugh to provide military assistance in its struggle for independence from the Federation on March 11, 3301.^[8]^ Although the Crimson State Group eventually prevailed and Federal forces withdrew from Lugh, the system's new leadership opted not to join the Alliance, perhaps out of resentment for Mahon's refusal to intervene.

By 3303, the Alliance had largely avoided disputes with the Federation and Empire as tensions escalated between the latter two superpowers. On June 19, 3303, following an apparent attack by Thargoids on a Federal fleet, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon called for caution, arguing that it had not yet been proven that the destroyed Federal ships were the victims of Thargoid attacks, and that much could be learned from an advanced alien race.

The Alliance joined together with the Federation and the Empire to established Aegis, a scientific organization dedicated to researching the Thargoids that utilized the shared resources and knowledge of all three superpowers, on August 4, 3303.^[9]^

Following a second attack by Thargoid ships that destroyed a Federal fleet in Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55 on September 21, the Alliance and the other two superpowers widened Aegis' remit to focus on both research and defence. The organization's budget was dramatically increased, and it recruited the Engineers Liz Ryder and Professor Palin to produce a new anti-Thargoid weapon and a scanner for Thargoid ships, respectively.^[10]^^[11]^

On December 17, 3303, following a series of unprecedented attacks by Thargoids against Stations, the Alliance commissioned Lakon Spaceways to develop and produce a new ship on an accelerated basis to combat the escalating alien threat: the Type-10 Defender. This marked the first overtly military response from the Alliance to the ongoing Thargoid conflict.^[12]^ The Type-10 was released to the public the following week.^[13]^ After the success of the Type-10, further collaboration with Lakon resulted in the creation of a line of Alliance military vessels that were released throughout 3304: the Alliance Chieftain, the Alliance Challenger, and the Alliance Crusader.^[14]^^[15]^

On August 31, 3304, Alliance President Gibson Kincaid confirmed that he would run for re-election and campaign to invest his office with executive powers above those of both the Alliance Assembly and the Alliance Prime Minister.^[16]^ While the proposed restructuring of the Alliance bureaucracy was criticized as a risky move that could imbue the presidency with emperor-like authority, the Assembly agreed to hold a vote on it on the same day as the next Alliance presidential election, October 16.^[17]^^[18]^ Kincaid faced two opponents in the election: Fazia Silva, a successful entrepreneur who lacked political experience and intended to leverage her business acumen to increase trade and boost economies throughout the Alliance, and Elijah Beck, a respected politician with over four decades of experience in the Alliance Assembly who was unlikely to propose any radical changes.^[18]^ With Kincaid's proposal essentially riding on his chances for victory, political analysts commented that the 3304 presidential election could be the most consequential in Alliance history.^[17]^ Fazia Silva was found poisoned to death on October 5; Alliance Interpol opened an investigation.^[19]^

On October 17, the day after the election, Kincaid was confirmed to be victorious over Beck by a narrow margin. Meanwhile, the Assembly opted to debate Kincaid's proposal for one additional week before putting it to a vote.^[20]^ On October 26, the Assembly rejected Kincaid's proposal, but agreed on revising the role of Alliance President. As a result, the Office of the Alliance President was created, a non-political department consisting of a team of ambassadorial emissaries with a diplomatic focus which the Alliance President would oversee. The presidency's term was also increased from one year to three years.^[21]^

This was far from the end of controversy surrounding the presidency, however. Kincaid's second term became turbulent as he began promoting militarism and acting beyond the purview of his office, and this aggression took a toll on his reputation.^[22]^^[23]^ In May 3305, Councillor Beck accused Kincaid of campaign finance violations, and the Assembly approved a formal inquiry into the allegations.^[24]^^[25]^ Further complicating matters, Council of Admirals member Frederick Yamamoto granted command of the Zaonce Alliance Defence Force fleet to Kincaid, giving an Alliance President the unprecedented power to issue orders to an ADF fleet directly.^[26]^ Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon called on Kincaid to resign, but Kincaid rejected Mahon's demand.^[27]^ A major blow was dealt to Kincaid on June 1, 3305, when his ally Admiral Yamamoto was arrested for bankrolling the murder of Fazia Silva, which authorities believed was carried out to aid Kincaid's reelection campaign. The Council of Admirals assumed joint command of the Zaonce ADF fleet in Yamamoto's absence.^[28]^ On June 7, it came to light that Kincaid was behind a conspiracy involving Yamamoto and other influential individuals which sought to move the Alliance's capital to Zaonce and then establish Kincaid as the Alliance's supreme ruler.^[29]^ Kincaid and several conspirators were apprehended by Alliance Interpol and charged with treason, murder, and corruption on June 13, and the Alliance Assembly voted to remove Kincaid from office.^[30]^ On June 21, the Assembly voted to amend the constitution and abolish the Alliance presidency, citing Kincaid's crimes as proof that the position was vulnerable to abuse. Councillor Beck resigned from the Assembly to oversee the restructuring of the presidency's defunct diplomatic department, which became the Alliance Office of Diplomatic Relations.^[31]^^[32]^

On October 20, 3306, as numerous Marlinists fled Imperial space to avoid persecution amid the Imperial Navy's anti-terrorism operation against the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army, some of these political refugees arrived in several outlying Federal systems seeking asylum, sparking a diplomatic confrontation between the two superpowers. Although no Marlinists had yet been reported traveling to Alliance space, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon pledged that they would be welcomed if they did.^[33]^

The Alliance began an initiative to colonise the Coalsack Nebula on November 12, 3306, weeks after a ghost ship, the Adamastor, returned to the Chukchan system and revealed that a survey team had discovered Thargoid Barnacles in the nebula almost two centuries ago. The Alliance Assembly approved the plan on November 9, and the expedition partnered with several corporations including Sirius Atmospherics. It was believed that Prime Minister Mahon had organised the expedition to bolster the Alliance's economy through the influx of Meta-Alloys, which would help his bid for reelection in 3307.^[34]^^[35]^^[36]^ Four new research stations were opened in the Coalsack on November 26.^[37]^

Amid the turbulence caused by the Marlinist refugee crisis, a Thargoid resurgence, tensions between the Empire and Federation, and widespread economic instability, Simguru Pranav Antal of Utopia proposed the Galactic Summit on January 1, 3307. It would be the first ever diplomatic conference between the three superpowers, and its purpose was to allow the Alliance, Empire, and Federation to peacefully debate their differences and agree on solutions to the most significant threats facing humanity.^[38]^ Despite the idea originating with Utopia, the superpowers ultimately selected Sirius Corporation to host the Galactic Summit after CEO Li Yong-Rui demonstrated he could better prepare security for the event.^[39]^ The Alliance's delegation to the Galactic Summit was led by Prime Minister Mahon, with Councillor Nakato Kaine of Tionisla, Mahon's most vocal critic, attending separately.^[40]^^[41]^

Councillor Kaine emerged as Mahon's foremost opponent in the run up to the 3307 election for prime minister. Kaine established a platform criticizing Mahon for the Alliance's increased dependence on corporations and the other two superpowers, as well as its aggressive pursuit of meta-alloys in Thargoid territories.^[42]^ As the election campaign season got underway, Mahon proposed delaying the Alliance election to prevent a schedule conflict with the Galactic Summit, also planned for late February. This was narrowly approved by the Assembly on February 1, and the election was provisionally rescheduled for May 3307, extending Mahon's term by three months. Councillor Kaine likened the move to the actions of a corrupt emperor or president, and accused Mahon of having misplaced priorities.^[43]^ By February 23, Kaine had become the figurehead of a widespread protest movement against the postponement, and some pundits claimed that she would win the election if it occurred on its original date.^[41]^

On February 16, 3307, the Alliance Assembly approved the purchase of a controlling stake in Lakon Spaceways, which had become a key defence contractor for the Alliance Defence Force since its partnership with the company began in 3303. While Lakon ships would remain available to the general public, most of the company's personnel and resources would be relocated to Alliance territory.^[44]^ The company's new administrative headquarters, Lakon Spaceways Central on planet 1 A of the Alioth system, was completed on February 19.^[45]^

On March 3, 3307, at the Galactic Summit in Sirius, Prime Minister Mahon personally ratified the Cornelius-Lasky Convention with his Federal and Imperial counterparts.^[46]^ The conference was cancelled on March 11 following the Nine Martyrs, a series of coordinated attacks on starports in nine major systems, including Donaldson in Alioth, that were carried out by the NMLA.^[47]^ As a result of the Cornelius-Lasky Convention establishing new communications protocols between the security forces of the superpowers, Alliance Interpol participated in the creation of the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit (ACT) to defeat the NMLA.^[48]^

The long-awaited 3307 election for prime minister took place on May 27 with no further delays. Opinion polls indicated that Prime Minister Mahon would win reelection comfortably, but noted that Councillor Kaine had amassed broad support for her policies. Mahon demonstrated the resilience of his own popularity by triumphing over Kaine in a public, pre-election initiative to gather materials for an expansion plan to construct two new Alliance starports, Enterprise Market in LHS 2522 and Prosperity Core in Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19. Kaine's competing initiative involved gathering materials to bolster manufacturing within the Alliance and boost supplies of rare commodities, but was unsuccessful.^[49]^^[50]^^[51]^ Edmund Mahon's historic election to a second term was officially confirmed on May 28; the announcement of results was delayed after some councillors insisted on additional checks. Mahon won a plurality of the Alliance Assembly's votes, and it was observed that from the Assembly's point of view, he likely represented stability and measured leadership in a time of ongoing galactic turmoil.^[52]^ However, controversy ensnared Mahon's expansion programme on June 25 when Councillor Kaine revealed evidence that the Prime Minister had possibly made a backroom deal with Sirius Corporation to help complete the two new starports.^[53]^

Later that year, Mahon encouraged the Assembly to seek a strategic defence contract with Sirius Corp in response to heightened fears of a Thargoid invasion of Alliance space, leading to the Assembly inviting CEO Li Yong-Rui to Alioth on December 22, 3307 to discuss ways to enhance the Alliance Defence Force.^[54]^ The Alliance entered into a defence pact with Sirius Corp on January 3, 3308 after the measure was approved by a slim majority in a rare, closed-door, joint session of the Assembly and Council of Admirals. In exchange for priority access to certain undisclosed financial opportunities, the megacorp pledged to support the ADF in anti-xeno operations.^[55]^ The new pact went into effect on January 10 with the addition of a seventh seat on the Council of Admirals for Admiral Nikolas Glass, a member of the Sirius Navy who would oversee the Alliance's anti-Thargoid operations.^[56]^ Additionally, Mahon granted Sirius Corp permission on January 14 to establish a permanent presence in Alliance space by deploying megaships in Alioth and three other Alliance systems, an executive decision that Kaine argued required Assembly approval. Sirius Corp advisors also officially joined the ADF and multiple government departments to streamline cooperation.^[57]^ The defence pact proved timely, as the superpowers agreed to shut down Aegis on January 18, 3308 per the recommendation of the Baumann Report, which had found that Aegis was no longer able to effectively carry out its anti-Thargoid responsibilities. Admiral Glass confirmed that the ADF and Sirius Navy would assume Aegis's role in defending the Alliance.^[58]^ In response to a conflict in Reorte between the local ruling faction and Sirius Corp in early February,^[59]^ the Alliance reevaluated the implementation of the pact and set a three-month trial period for Sirius to demonstrate its effectiveness, at the end of which the Assembly would decide whether or not to continue the partnership.^[60]^

An Alliance city
 		 	 

Today, the Alliance is widely seen as a paragon of democracy in an increasingly autocratic galaxy. It is governed by a body known as the Alliance Assembly, the primary function of which is to establish common policies and treaties among the Alliance's member systems, and act as an arbitration body when necessary. The notional head of the Alliance Assembly is the Alliance Prime Minister, but in practice it is the Council of Admirals, which commands the Alliance Defence Force, that typically wields the greatest degree of power.^[3]^

### Alliance Values

On July 2, 3301, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon gave a speech about the values of the Alliance which he holds dear at the esteemed Alioth University, his alma mater:^[61]^

*“The Alliance of Independent Systems is built upon a single defining principle and that is one of freedom. The freedoms we enjoy range from our personal freedoms as inscribed in the Bill of Human Rights to the freedom of societies and even planets within the Alliance.”*^[61]^

*“But we should not accept this grace blindly or assume that its existence continues by mere chance. The birth of the Alliance came from removing the burden of the Federation and the Empire who for centuries fought each other for our resources and we were caught helpless in the middle.”*^[61]^

*“Both of those organisations proudly describe their origins as being freedom from the tyranny of others. And yet now they are the tyranny and it is our duty to oppose them, while also ensuring that we don’t become them.”*^[61]^

### Political Variety and Controversy

The Alliance is devoted to liberty and self-determination for both its citizens and the governments of its member systems. As a consequence of the Alliance granting member systems a greater degree of autonomy than the Federation and Empire, however, a small number of systems are controlled by Alliance-aligned dictatorship, feudalism, communism, theocracy, and anarchy minor factions. Permitting these government types to operate within the Alliance has been a point of controversy, as they are generally autocratic or even criminal, and some of them allow slavery with no restrictions. As such, these governments are arguably at odds with the Alliance's outspoken commitment to liberty.^[62]^

The Alliance's criminal and autocratic systems totals as of January 3308 are compared with those of the Federation and the Empire below:^[63]^

| Allegiance | Anarchy Systems | Communism Systems | Dictatorship Systems | Feudal Systems | ExpandTheocracy Systems |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alliance | 4 | 39 | 34 | 5 | 9 |
| Empire | 15 | 0 | 430 | 411 | 0 |
| Federation | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 19 |

A group calling itself the "Children of Liberty" accused the Alliance of *"rampant hypocrisy"* on August 7, 3301, claiming that a *"huge gulf"* exists between the Alliance's professed goals and values and the reality present in many of its member systems:^[62]^

*"For an organization that purports to be devoted to the ideals of liberty and self-determination"*, the release stated, *"the Alliance certainly tolerates a great deal of despotism and tyranny within its own borders. It's about time the Alliance addressed the rampant hypocrisy of allowing dictatorships – as well as other restrictive, undemocratic forms of government – membership into their supposed bastion of freedom and liberty."*^[62]^

The statement went on to list a number of Alliance-sponsored autocracies in various systems, and called on the Alliance and its supporters to sponsor serious democratic reform in said systems by backing democratically-aligned factions over autocratic ones.^[62]^

### Leadership

 	 	[![Edmund Mahon](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/5e/Edmund_Mahon.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20241208033953)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/5e/Edmund_Mahon.png/revision/latest?cb=20241208033953) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Prime Minister Edmund Mahon
 		 	 

The Alliance Prime Minister serves as the Alliance's head of government and head of state; the current Prime Minister is Edmund Mahon. The Prime Minister is elected by the Councillors of the Alliance Assembly for a term of six years, and plays an important role in corralling the fractious Assembly into considering and passing legislation, although real power within the Alliance rests with the Civil Servants and the Council of Admirals. There is no term limit, so it is theoretically possible for a Prime Minister to be re-elected and serve multiple terms, but frequent disputes within the Assembly usually preclude any individual from completing their first term. Prime Ministers who fail to win Assembly votes on key policy issues for their platforms often resign, or occasionally are ousted by a vote of no confidence. Since the formation of the Alliance in 3230, only one Alliance Prime Minister, Edmund Mahon, has been elected to a second term.^[2]^^[66]^^[52]^

From 3230 to 3305, the Alliance's head of state was a separate office, the President of the Alliance. For most of its history, the presidency was a largely ceremonial role with little practical power. Alliance Presidents were elected to a one-year term, and were limited to no more than two terms. This changed in October 3304 following the re-election of Gibson Kincaid to the presidency. Kincaid had run for a second term on a platform that demanded the Assembly transfer executive powers from the Prime Minister to the President and expand the term length to six years.^[67]^ The Assembly rejected this proposal, but did make some changes: the President would from then on serve a single term of three years, and would also oversee a new diplomatic department called the Office of the Alliance President, which took on the ambassadorial duties that Councillors had previously managed individually.^[68]^ These changes were short-lived. In June 3305, President Gibson Kincaid was exposed as the mastermind of a far-reaching conspiracy to move the Alliance's political center from Alioth to Zaonce so that Kincaid could eventually establish himself as the supreme ruler of the Alliance with absolute power.^[69]^ Kincaid was removed from office, he and his co-conspirators were charged with treason,^[70]^ and on June 21, 3305, the Assembly voted to abolish the presidency to prevent the position from being abused ever again.^[71]^

### Council of Admirals

The seven^[56]^ members of Council of Admirals are responsible for commanding the Alliance Defence Force. The Council wields power independently from the Alliance Assembly and can issue orders to the ADF fleets without the Assembly's prior approval for the sake of rapid-response capability. However, the Assembly decides which admirals sit on the Council, and the Council is required to report and account for its decisions to the Assembly after any military action. Each admiral on the Council is the commander of one of the ADF's largest contributing fleets; members have been appointed from the navies of Lave, Zaonce, and Tionisla.^[2]^

The Council of Admirals originally held only six seats, but was expanded with a seventh, non-Alliance seat on January 10, 3308 to accommodate a representative from the Sirius Navy after the Alliance implemented a strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation. The Sirius Navy representative on the Council is charged with coordinating the ADF and Sirius Navy's joint anti-Thargoid operations.^[56]^

### Alliance Assembly

The Councillors of the Alliance Assembly are elected by the people of each member state. Some member states have slightly different electoral rules based on their history. The number of Councillors within the Alliance Assembly is based on the size of each member state's respective populations; some only have one. The Councillors represent their member system politically in Parliament. The meetings of the Alliance Assembly are conducted virtually but run on Turner's World in Alioth. The Prime Minister is elected by the Councillors, and it is his or her job to corral them into some sort of consensus which is generally a slow process. There is much less tradition than in the other powers, and processes within the Alliance Assembly are still subject to change – generally when arguments break out, as they frequently do. In practice the Alliance is largely run by Civil Servants – salaried officials that look after day to day running of the Alliance, generally not getting involved in the political struggles. Due to much cultural variation the Alliance Assembly rarely gets anything done.^[2]^

The Alliance Assembly is the central body for the Alliance as a whole. While parallels can be drawn with the European Union in the 21st century, the Assembly lacks the law making powers of the EU. It mainly functions as a means for establishing common policies and treaties rather than laws. It also acts as an arbitration body between member states and depending on Assembly votes can enforce sanctions or corrective measures. However the politics of the member states often makes this a tricky process.^[72]^

When the ruling minor faction of a Member State changes, then depending on the rules of that Member State, it could change who represents them in the Assembly – but given that the Assembly rarely gets anything done, it is unlikely anyone will notice.^[2]^

## Military

### Alliance Defence Force

    - *Main article: Alliance Defence Force*

The Alliance Defence Force is the Alliance's primary warfare force. ADF fleets patrol Imperial systems, confront incursions from other superpowers, factions, and organisations, and support allies and friendly factions across the Core Systems. The ADF is led by the Council of Admirals.

The Alliance does not have a navy auxiliary like the Federation and Empire. Consequently, none of the Alliance's ships or systems are locked behind a rank system. The only permit-locked system within the Alliance is its capital, Alioth, and its permit can be acquired by gaining reputation with the Alioth Independents minor faction.

### Alliance Defence Force ships

Lakon Spaceways has designed and produced three ship models for use by the Alliance Defence Force and its allies. Unlike the Federation and the Empire, the ADF lacks its own capital ship, corvette, and fighter models, but these roles are filled by various other vessels provided by the naval forces of Allied member systems.

- Alliance Challenger
- Alliance Chieftain
- Alliance Crusader

## Permits

    - *For a list of Permits, see Permits/Alliance.*

Permits are required to access certain systems that are otherwise locked out by the computer of your Frame Shift Drive (FSD).

Such permits are rewarded by the controlling faction for that locked system, when you become allied with that faction. You can often find that faction on a station outside the main system they control.

Once allied, simply visit the Bulletin Board at any of the faction's stations to accept a job titled "Making Friends And Going Places". Accepting the job automatically adds the permit to your FSD computer.
