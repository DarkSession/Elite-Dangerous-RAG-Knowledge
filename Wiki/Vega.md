**Vega** is a Federation system. Travelling there requires a permit which is acquired at the rank of Chief Petty Officer in the Federal Navy Auxiliary. The rare commodity Vega Slimweed can be purchased at Taylor City.

On April 25, 3305, Vega was rocked by news that a Diamondback Explorer belonging to Commander Bjorn Lennox was stolen from its hangar in Fort Dixon, an improbable event given modern starport docking bay protocols. Security Chief Misaki Sanders was unable to explain how the thief hijacked Fort Dixon's security network, breached a docked and sealed ship, overrode authorization checks, and then departed the starport unchallenged.^[1]^ The thief was later identified as Gan Romero, a starship technician with no prior criminal record.^[2]^ The search for Romero was suspended on May 31, 3305 with little to show for it other than indications that Romero had been affected by vivid dreams that compelled him to travel to a distant, unknown location.^[3]^
