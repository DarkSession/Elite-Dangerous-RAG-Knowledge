The **Enzyme Missile Rack** is a dumbfire missile rack that can be unlocked through a Sirius Human Technology Broker. The missiles cause low damage on impact, but are tipped with Thargoid-derived enzymes that corrode the target's hull over time via a caustic burn effect.

## Unlocking

The Fixed Class 2 Enzyme Missile Rack can be permanently unlocked for purchase by providing the following Materials to a Human Technology Broker:

- 15 Tungsten
- 16 Thargoid Energy Cell
- 18 Thargoid Organic Circuitry
- 16 Molybdenum
- 6 Radiation Baffle

## Usage

> 
> 
> Enzyme missiles are a first attempt at replicating the Thargoids' organic hull corrosion weaponry. Although not as dangerous as the alien version, this newly created enzyme does effectively catalyze all types of human hull armour at point of contact. Tests on alien hulls have proven ineffective with the enzyme being immediately neutralised by the "skin" of the ships, even on long dead hulls. The missile does not penetrate shields, only applying the caustic burn when dealing damage to the hull.

Enzyme Missiles deal 5 damage on impact, and inflict a damage-over-time debuff. This debuff decays over 60 seconds, starting at approximately 3 DPS and falling to nearly zero before vanishing entirely, at just under 60 seconds. On average, it deals approximately 1.5 damage per second, but with the vast majority of damage taking place in the earlier part of the effect. This breaks down as follows: 33% of the total damage is inflicted in the first 11 seconds, another 33% damage is inflicted over the next 14 seconds, and the last 33% damage is inflicted over the remaining 35 seconds. Alternatively, it can also be stated that 75% of the total damage is dealt by the 30-second mark, and 93% of the total damage by the 45-second mark. 

As hitting an enemy with another missile will refresh the effect, it may be beneficial to refresh the effect before it fully expires, to sustain maximum DPS at the cost of total damage per ammo.
