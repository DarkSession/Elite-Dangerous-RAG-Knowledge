The **Federal Rebellion of 3307** was a wave of secessions of Federal member factions and systems provoked by dissent against the Proactive Detection Bureau, an invasive communications surveillance program run by the Federal Intelligence Agency for the purposes of identifying criminals and terrorists. The conflict began on June 29, 3307 with Mayor Constanza Noguera declaring the independence of her faction, Azaladshu Free, from the Federation, in blatant violation of the Federal Accord. The resulting battle in Azaladshu between the forces of Azaladshu Free and the Federal loyalist faction Neche Inc concluded in victory for the former, which inspired more Federal factions to secede over the next few months. The rebellion involved only a small fraction of the Federation's territory and population, and rebellious sentiment largely waned by November 3307, but despite the combined efforts of Federal diplomats and security forces, none of the Federal factions that attempted to secede during the crisis were successfully dissuaded or blocked from doing so.

## Background

The Nine Martyrs bombings on March 11, 3307, which claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Federal citizens and Vice President Brad Mitchell, drove a new focus on domestic security within the Federal government. This was spearheaded by Mitchell's successor as Vice President, former Federal Intelligence Agency director and Congressman Jerome Archer, who personally authored the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, which was designed to enhance Federal surveillance powers over public and private communications networks to locate Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army cells and other criminal organisations.^[1]^^[2]^ Although the implementation of the Proactive Detection Bureau met with majority public approval, Shadow President Felicia Winters and others argued that the program was an unconstitutional burden on Federal citizens and did little to counter the NMLA, which used undetectable dark comms networks.^[3]^^[4]^ Systems within Winters's sphere of influence became increasingly disillusioned and convinced that the Federation had forsaken its commitment to individual liberty. This was exacerbated in early May 3307 by the defeat of a public initiative sponsored by Winters to circumvent the PDB by distributing legal technologies and techniques that Federal citizens could have used to guard against government intrusion, while a rival initiative sponsored by President Zachary Hudson succeeded in strengthening the PDB's capabilities.^[5]^^[6]^

## Events

### Secession of Azaladshu Free

As tensions within the Federation reached fever-pitch over the issue of domestic surveillance, the first domino fell in the Azaladshu system in June 3307. That month, Constanza Noguera rode a wave of unrest against the Proactive Detection Bureau to victory in an election for the position of Mayor of the Azaladshu Free faction, which controlled Azaladshu, LFT 824, LHS 277, and LTT 3919. On June 29, 3307, Mayor Noguera declared Azaladshu Free an independent nation, and abandoning its commitment to the Federal Accord and pulling its four systems out of the Federation. In her declaration, Noguera cited the PDB and Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act as examples of Federal tyranny and corruption that had compelled the decision to secede. Federal Congress ruled that the secession was illegal under the Federal Accord, and President Zachary Hudson placed the Federal Navy on alert and urged Azaladshu Free to return to full compliance with the law.^[7]^

Azaladshu Free's security forces engaged the forces of Neche Inc, a Federal loyalist faction, in Azaladshu on July 1, 3307 to secure its independence. Neche Inc was supported by the Federal megaship Fortress Liberty, which Hudson had deployed to Azaladshu shortly before the onset of hostilities after receiving advance intelligence on the secession. Three other Federal factions within Shadow President Felicia Winters's sphere of influence, the Coalition of Uteran, LP 726-6 Free, and Gluscap Labour, were also evaluating secession and tied their decision to the outcome of the battle. Meanwhile, Shadow President Winters faced scrutiny in Federal Congress for not taking measures to prevent the rebellion; she explained that she did not support the rebellion, but her position on the unconstitutionality of the PDB remained unchanged.^[8]^ On July 8, Azaladshu Free achieved a decisive victory over Federal forces, preserving its sovereignty. The three onlooker factions were amply reassured by this outcome and declared their independence as well, taking the systems of Uteran, Ga'anjob'al, LP 726-6, Aunochis, Gluscap, V902 Centauri with them.^[9]^

In total, 10 systems with a combined population of one billion people severed ties with the Federation as a result of the Azaladshu conflict. While this was a minuscule portion of the Federation's overall territory and population, and a majority of Federal citizens continued to voice support for the PDB, it was highly unusual for a member faction of a superpower to abruptly abandon its fealty. Furthermore, the incident represented a significant misstep for President Hudson, and criticism of Winters also intensified. The civil rights group Advocacy issued a report on July 21 that the Federal Intelligence Agency was arresting secessionist ringleaders in other systems in spurious charges in an attempt to prevent the spread of the rebellion.^[10]^ Advocacy provided proof for its claims on July 28, which were corroborated by FIA Deputy Director Bethany Blake in a statement to the media. Blake noted that the Federal Accord classified unilateral declarations of independence without a proper referendum to be criminal acts, and therefore preventing them fell under the legal remit of the PDB, justifying the preemptive arrests of secessionists. Vice President Jerome Archer defended the PDB in a session of Congress, but was met with criticism from Congressman Bai Zheng, who asserted the PDB had done more to create the rebellion than to fulfill its original mandate of uprooting Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army cells. Meanwhile, President Hudson and Shadow President Winters personally contacted system leaders to defuse discontent.^[11]^

### New Kuwembaa Labour withdraws

A second wave of secession was set off on July 30, when Governor Sonal Mishra of New Kuwembaa Labour declared his faction's independence. Five more systems, Kuwembaa, HIP 46179, Velniat, Navas, and Antliae Sector EG-Y d80, broke away from the Federation, and another three factions that controlled a total of 28 systems also began preparing for separation. President Hudson ordered Governor Mishra to recant, and redeployed the Fortress Liberty to Kuwembaa in anticipation of a second confrontation. In a sign that the rebellion may be peaking, however, it was reported that leaders within the Coalition of Uteran and Gluscap Labour were having second thoughts about leaving the Federation, and the former congressmen of those factions believed they were amenable to rejoining.^[12]^

The Federal loyalist faction Li Chotep for Equality launched an attack on New Kuwembaa Labour on August 5, 3307 on President Hudson's orders, with the goal being to cull the rogue faction's military forces enough to halt the rebellion in its tracks. The three factions considering secession based on New Kuwembaa Labour's fate were identified as Selkana Labour, the United HIP 108095 Values Party, and Mutumu Future; the first controlled 7 systems at the time, while the latter two controlled 10 systems each. The Coalition of Uteran and Gluscap Labour also monitored the battle, and affirmed that a convincing Federation victory would be sufficient for them to resubmit to the Federal Accord.^[13]^ New Kuwembaa Labour declared victory on August 12. The battle's outcome matched the Azaladshu conflict in terms of decisiveness, and Selkana Labour, the United HIP 108095 Values Party, and Mutumu Future were all encouraged to follow New Kuwembaa Labour and secede with their 27 systems. The Coalition of Uteran and Gluscap Labour were reassured by the Federal defeat and set aside any plans to rejoin the Federation, effectively cementing the rebellion's success up to that point. The newly-independent systems all severed their links with the Proactive Detection Bureau, and Governor Sonal Mishra issued a warning to President Hudson that his steadfast support for the PDB was damaging the Federation.^[14]^

The Kuwembaa conflict served to stir interest in secession as many as 50 other Federal factions. Shadow President Winters pleaded with Federal Congress on August 23 to repeal the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act and shut down the PDB to prevent further secessions, warning that the rebellion was on the threshold of causing severe damage to the Federation. Vice President Archer doubled down on his support for the PDB, pointing to increased security and reduced crime rates across Federal space. Meanwhile, some of the newly-independent systems were reportedly coming to the realisation that leaving the Federation also meant giving up Federal protection, and expressed concern that they were now vulnerable to retaliatory strikes from pro-Federation groups as well as opportunistic attacks from various hostile forces.^[15]^ On September 1, Imperial Senator Denton Patreus and Alliance Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran offered their opinions on the Federation's rebellion troubles, and criticised President Hudson as authoritarian and arrogant for continuing to operate the PDB. Archer retorted that neither the Empire nor the Alliance had yet acted to develop their own preventative strategies against terrorism, while the PDB had revolutionised the Federation's intelligence-gathering capabilities.^[16]^

### The final wave

Yet another wave of secessions occurred on September 13, when seven minor factions simultaneously declared independence from the Federation. In contrast with the previous secessions, these factions, identified as Unktock Free, United Posenoi League, Progressive Party of Inggale, Social LHS 6103 Confederation, Tawembalis Services, Union of Hanung Tzu Confederacy, and Wolf 1323 Crimson Energy Systems, did not control any systems. Vice President Archer was unfazed by the development, and it was speculated that the Federal government interpreted the departure of only smaller and less influential factions as a sign that the rebellion was losing steam and the PDB was gradually gaining acceptance. Regardless, the rebellion's latest wave was a fresh embarrassment for both President Hudson and Shadow President Winters.^[17]^

By November 3, 3307, no other secessions had occurred. Fresh polls indicated that rebellious sentiment in the Federation was declining in response to the PDB's recent success in exposing the corporatist extremist group Jupiter's Wrath, which had been on the verge of carrying out a spree of terror attacks and political assassinations. Many citizens who had opposed the PDB reconsidered their stances after seeing that communications surveillance could save lives. However, a number of Federal factions continued to watch the seceded factions, and it was thought that the rebels' success or failure as independent states might prolong the Federal rebellion or finally bring it to an end.^[18]^

## Impact

The negative effects of the rebellion on the Federation itself were negligible, as each of the superpowers were large enough that they gained and lost members regularly via local politics without threatening their overall stability. A minor faction suddenly abandoning fealty to a superpower for any reason was rare, however, and the Federal Rebellion of 3307 was highly embarrassing for both President Zachary Hudson, who failed to prevent the rebellion from spreading, and Shadow President Felicia Winters, who was widely blamed for enflaming secessionist sentiment by encouraging protests against the PDB.^[10]^

By November 3, 3307, a total of 15 factions and 37 systems had seceded from the Federation.
