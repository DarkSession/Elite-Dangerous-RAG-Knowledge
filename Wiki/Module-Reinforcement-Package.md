**Module Reinforcement Packages (MRP)** reduce the damage that other ship modules receive from weapon hits. They absorb a portion of the incoming damage until they are depleted.

## Usage

The D-rated MRP has low damage capacity but high absorption of module damage. It can absorb a large proportion of module damage each time over a short period before running out of damage capacity.

The E-rated MRP has high damage capacity but low absorption. It can absorb a small proportion of damage each time over a long period before running out of damage capacity.

A critical - yet unmentioned - fact of Module Reinforcement Packages is that they only provide half their protective value to external modules, such as weapons. For example, a damaged weapon with one Module Reinforcement would take 70% of the full breach damage, rather than 40%, like an internal module.

## Engineer Modifications

There are currently no Engineer modification options for the Module Reinforcement Package.

## Notes

- Module Reinforcement Packages were added with update 2.2.03.
- Placed in an Optional Internal Compartment or Military Compartment.
- MRP can be repaired by an Auto Field-Maintenance Unit. Each unit of AFM ammo restores 10x as much health to an MRP as it will to other modules.^[1]^
