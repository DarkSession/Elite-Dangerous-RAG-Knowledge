The **Recon Limpet Controller** is a type of Limpet Controller module that can program limpets to hack data points, such as Hackable Data Transmitters and Cargo Bays found on Bulk Cruiser Megaships and Installations. Before a Recon Limpet can be deployed, the transmitter must first be scanned with a Data Link Scanner and then a subtarget of the transmitter must be selected.
