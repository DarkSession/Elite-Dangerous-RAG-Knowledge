# Landing Gear
Landing gear HUD indicator (shown here as deployed)
 		 	 

**Landing gear** must be deployed before attempting to dock on a Landing Pad or land on the surface of a terrestrial body with a ship. A ship's COVAS will issue an audible warning if the ship approaches a Landing Pad without deploying landing gear. Failing to deploy landing gear before docking can damage or even destroy a ship.

Landing gear status is displayed on the right side of the central panel of the HUD. When the landing gear indicator is lit blue, the ship's landing gear is deployed. When the indicator is unlit, landing gear is retracted. Deploying and retracting landing gear will also be signalled by COVAS audio messages.

Deploying the landing gear in normal flight will decrease the ship's speed to half of its potential. Landing gear cannot be deployed while the ship is in supercruise or hyperspace, and landing gear must be retracted before a jump to supercruise or hyperspace can be attempted.

## Notes

- The landing gear control can be assigned to a different key or button in the settings. On PC, the default button for landing gear is the "L" key. On Xbox, it is "B" + "Down" on the D-pad.
