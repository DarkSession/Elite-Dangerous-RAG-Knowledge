# Inertial Impact
Inertial Impact on fixed Burst Lasers
 		 	 

**Inertial Impact** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to Burst Lasers through Engineering. It is an experimental upgrade that adds an additional 50% of total damage as kinetic, at the cost of introducing 3 degrees of aiming jitter.

As a result of aiming jitter, weapons with Inertial Impact will become inaccurate, making it difficult to hit targets beyond a short range. 

## Applicability

This effect is available to the following weapons:

- Burst Laser

## Required Materials

- 5x Flawed Focus Crystals
- 5x Distorted Shield Cycle Recordings
- 5x Atypical Disrupted Wake Echoes
