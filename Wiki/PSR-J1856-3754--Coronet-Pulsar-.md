The 'Coronet' Pulsar is the colloquial term for the double neutron star system of PSR J1856-3754, the closest pulsar to Sol with a mere 521 light years. It lies in the Corona Austrinae molecular cloud and is associated with the so-called Coronet Cluster (CrA), a small cluster of young stars embedded in a small emission nebula (R CrA/NGC 6729) in that same region. The pulsar is also a member of the Magnificent Seven, a group of isolated neutron stars that are all relatively close to Sol and fall in line with the Gould Belt.

The pulsar was once suspected to be a quark star, a hypothetical type of compact exotic star composed of quark matter, where extremely high temperature and pressure forces nuclear particles to dissolve into a continuous phase consisting of free quarks. Later observations determined it did not have sufficient temperature and size for this type of star.

Survey in July 3303 revealed that the system is actually two pulsars in close orbit, along with a companion B-class star and two L-class dwarves. The primary pulsar is currently the hottest known stellar object, with a surface temperature of 985,067,520 kelvin.

## **Neutron Highway Initiative**

The Neutron Highway Initiative is a groundbreaking step towards the future of interstellar Transportation.

As a visionary project driven by cutting-edge scientific advancements, it aims to revolutionize the way humanity traverses space and colonisation.

At its core, the Neutron Highway Initiative seeks to develop an interconnected network of high-energy neutron conduits, enabling unprecedented speeds in space travel and efficient energy transfer across vast cosmic distances. By leveraging the unique properties of neutron supercharges and controlled quantum tunneling, we aim to establish a stable and sustainable infrastructure for deep-space exploration and interplanetary commerce.

This initiative brings together the brightest minds in astrophysics, quantum mechanics, and engineering, fostering international collaboration and innovation. Our mission is to unlock the full potential of space travel, reduce the constraints of current propulsion technologies, and ensure a greener and more efficient energy solution for future generations.

As we embark on this ambitious journey, we invite governments, research institutions, and private enterprises to join us in shaping the future of space exploration. Together, we can build the foundation for a new era—where humanity is no longer bound by the limits of traditional space travel but propelled into the vast unknown by the power of the Neutron Highway.

Stay connected with us as we push the boundaries of science and redefine what is possible. The future begins now.
