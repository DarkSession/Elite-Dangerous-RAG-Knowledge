In Elite Dangerous players can change their **Reputation** with the three major factions (Federation, Empire, Alliance) and countless minor factions to either Allied, Friendly, Cordial, Neutral, Unfriendly, or Hostile. All players start out as Neutral with all factions and by doing missions or other influence increasing activities can improve their reputation with that faction. When a player performs activities that would decrease a faction's influence (e.g. pirating or failing missions) the player's reputation with that faction will decrease. When a player has Hostile status with a faction they will be attacked on sight by NPCs that represent that faction.

## Local, Minor Factions and Reputation

 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Pilot faction reputation
 		 	 

Who is in control of a system has a major bearing on how your actions affect your reputation with them and the other minor factions. There are usually several minor factions vying for control in each system, but outside the immediate local space around their Starports, Outposts or other assets, only one can claim to be "in control" of a system. This is displayed in the system view when you have no stellar body selected.

Normally it is the faction with the highest influence in the system, except in special situations like Civil War.

This is important for criminal law, because each faction only cares about crimes committed in its own jurisdiction. It does not matter if you are an infamous pirate according to say, the "Bangwa Freedom Party", if you are in the jurisdiction of the "Bagwa Independents" and you have committed no crimes against them, you are an innocent pilot.

In addition, most ships are aligned with a minor faction (you can see which one by performing a basic scan).

So if a ship is wanted in the current jurisdiction, but is aligned with a different minor faction for which it has no criminal record, then destroying it will cause you to lose reputation with the faction it is aligned with; in their opinion, you have just destroyed an innocent citizen of theirs.

Higher reputation also gives you access to bigger and better rewarded missions.

## Gaining and Losing Reputation

Your reputation goes up whenever you do good things for the faction. Completing missions, join Conflict Zones on their side when they are at War. If they control an asset, then doing anything profitable at that asset gives you a reputation boost: selling cargo for a profit, handing in Bounty Vouchers, generally working with contacts, even handing in exploration data, will all give you a reputation boost.

Negative reputation is doing the opposite. Failing or abandoning their missions, doing other factions' missions against them, blowing up their ships or (if they own an asset) authority ships and selling trade goods at a loss.^[1]^

It seems that a change of reputation status is an official act because the faction's operations team sends the concerned Commanders a confirming message about raising or demoting their status.

## Faction Representatives and Reputation

Minor factions are represented in the Mission Board by various people who bear a title depending on your reputation status and the faction government type. The higher the Commander's reputation status, the higher Faction Representative authorises missions. The representatives are the same for all players in all systems where the minor faction is present, suggesting they are very probably not physically at the facility you are connected to.

Their titles were changed in *Odyssey* interface redesign, not portraits and names though. Below are two tables (one incomplete) for both versions:

## Reputation Decay

Reputation decay only applies to the major factions: the Federation, Empire, and Alliance.

When your status with a major faction is above 75% Friendly, it will slowly decay down to 75%, by at least one percentage point per day. Reputation decay happens whether you are logged into the game or not. To stay Allied you have to keep doing good deeds that gain you reputation for the major faction.

There is also anti-decay for negative reputation. When your reputation with a super power is below Neutral but under 25% it will gradually climbs up to 25%. To clear negative reputation with a major faction you must do the following: (1) If your status with a major faction is at Hostile, you must wait for the reputation decay mechanic to bring it back up to Unfriendly (2) Once your status with a major faction is at Unfriendly, you need to complete missions and do other positive reputation actions until you are back to Neutral status.

There is currently no reputation decay for minor factions.^[1]^^[2]^

## Notes

- Reputation with a major faction is an independent value from Rank in its navy auxiliary.
