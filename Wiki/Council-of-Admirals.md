# Council of Admirals
The **Council of Admirals** is a military body comprised of seven^[1]^ admirals that command the largest naval forces in the Alliance.^[2]^ The Council operates independently of the councillors of the Alliance Assembly,^[2]^ but the Assembly retains the power to approve who may join it,^[3]^ and the Council is required to report to the Assembly after events to facilitate rapid decision-making.^[2]^ On rare occasions, the Council will participate in a joint session with the Assembly to vote on certain issues relevant to the Alliance's security.^[4]^ Admirals on the Council have been appointed from the fleets of major Alliance member systems^[2]^ such as Lave, Zaonce, and Tionisla.^[5]^^[6]^^[3]^

The Council also commands the entire Alliance Defence Force, a vast flotilla of ships contributed by each of the Alliance's member systems. The Council of Admirals is free to deploy the Defence Force without the approval of the Alliance Assembly, making it extremely powerful.^[2]^^[7]^ Members of the Council have the power to delegate command of their respective fleets to other individuals of their choice by decree, and such a decree cannot be overruled by the Council.^[8]^ In the event that that the admiral of an ADF fleet is removed or incapacitated, the Council can take joint command of that fleet pending the admiral's return to duty or the appointment of a replacement.^[9]^

Originally, the Council held only six seats for the fleets of the six largest Alliance members, but a seventh, non-Alliance seat was added on January 10, 3308 to accommodate a representative from the Sirius Navy after the Alliance approved a strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation to strengthen the ADF against the Thargoids amidst the Second Thargoid War.^[1]^
