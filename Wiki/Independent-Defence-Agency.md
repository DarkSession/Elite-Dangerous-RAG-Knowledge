**The Independent Defence Agency** (IDA) is a Minor Faction  (and player group) with the general purpose of protecting humans and human society throughout the Bubble. The faction/group does this in a variety of ways, including schooling/teaching commanders to become proficient in combat and engineering and to ensure that they know how to protect others when they are in need. 

The IDA also directly confronts Thargoids as well as other humans and organisations through combat and also carries out research initiatives.

## About

The Independent Defence Agency currently controls 6 star systems with a presence in a further 2 and is currently working to expand further.

The rank structure of the IDA is as displayed in the blue diagram below. The current Admiral of the Fleet is shown in the portrait below.

## History

While the exact date and reason of the founding of the IDA have become lost, its history originates on Earth (Sol), from a group of like-minded individuals who left the system in opposition of the Federation (once known as the United States) rule. The agency has not since publicly declared any further animosity for the Federation, but they do publicly remain in opposition to any current superpower - and hold the goal of one day being able to oppose the current dominators of human occupied space by becoming a worthy power themselves.

In more recent years, the IDA has developed a good combat flight academy and has led many successful raids against the Thargoids as well as holding many other kinds of events.
