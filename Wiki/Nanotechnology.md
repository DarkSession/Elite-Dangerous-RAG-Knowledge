Humanity has dabbled with nano technology, but the Guardians’ achievements far surpassed our own.^[2]^ The material panels and relics found at Guardian sites incorporate nanobot technology which activates when in proximity to a foreign body. This explains the faint glow given off by many Guardian materials and structures.^[2]^^[3]^

Mineral Extractors - found in the commodity markets of many Industrial systems - use 'grey-goo' components, which are another name for Nanotechnology. These micro devices are injected into minerals to separate specific constituents from mixed ores along grain boundaries.^[4]^
