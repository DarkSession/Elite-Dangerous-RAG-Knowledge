> Custom angling of plates at critical points along the ship's hull make projectile strikes more likely to glance, reducing the impact of kinetic damage at the cost of structural integrity.

**Angled Plating** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to modules through Engineering. It increases Kinetic Resistance at the expense of Hull Boost.

As armour is not very resistant to Kinetic Damage, most builds should benefit from this upgrade.
