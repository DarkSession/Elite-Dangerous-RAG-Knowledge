**Eotienses** is an Imperial system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It is the home system of Senator Denton Patreus, and where his personal flagship, the Majestic-Class Interdictor INV Imperial Freedom, is stationed. Eotienses A 3, the system's only hospitable world, is the location of the system's capital city of Port Isabelle and the Imperial Museum of Culture.

## History

Independent colonists first arrived in Eotienses in 2288, and established the system's first two stations, Parkinson Dock and Adams Market, to serve as hubs for mining, terraforming, and trading. The colonists founded the first planetside settlement on Eotienses A 3 on December 21, 2312 and named it Port Isabelle after Isabelle Patreus, the expedition's chief botanist and ancestor of Senator Denton Patreus. The anniversary of Port Isabelle's founding became an annual holiday called Planetfall. In 2314, the system's population voted by majority referendum to join the Empire.^[1]^

The starport Parkinson Dock was bombed by the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army on March 11, 3307, along with starports in eight other major systems. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed in the Nine Martyrs attack, and many more were injured. The coordinated attacks occurred during the Galactic Summit in Sirius, and caused the conference to be cancelled.^[2]^^[3]^
