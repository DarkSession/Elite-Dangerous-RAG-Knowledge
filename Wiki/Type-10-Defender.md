The **Type-10 Defender** is a large ship produced by Lakon Spaceways. It is a comprehensive revision of the design of the Type-9 Heavy. The Alliance commissioned Lakon to build the Type-10 to combat the escalating Thargoid threat following a series of attacks against Stations in the Pleiades Nebula. Announced on December 17, 3303, Lakon committed to an aggressive production schedule that delivered the Type-10 in volume to retailers the following week.^[1]^ Lakon intended the Type-10 to be "particularly effective in combat situations".^[2]^

## Overview

The Type-10 Defender is a mighty glacier; slow, heavily armored, and even more heavily armed, it bears the highest armor rating and theoretical damage in the game. In spite of this, the Type-10 is something of a paradox. When compared to similar ships in its price range(the Anaconda, Imperial Cutter and Federal Corvette), the Type-10 has the best armor, but the worst shielding. It has the best theoretical damage in the game, but wide hardpoint placement makes it impossible to effectively use fixed weapons. The ship's huge number of hardpoints seems ideal for turreted weapons, but hardpoint placement means all turrets can only be brought to bear when a target is directly in front of the ship. It has the rare ability to mount a class 8 shield, but less than half the shield capacity of the Cutter, and no ability to mount a class 8 Shield Cell bank. Its improved distributor improves its capability for mining, but reduced cargo capacity equally diminishes that capability. 

Overall, the Type-10 requires a very different design methodology from other large combat ships. Attempting to use fixed weapons, or to force the ship to rely heavily on shields, will often result in inferior results when compared to other alternatives. Some players equip it entirely with turrets and fly a Ship Launched Fighter, but this, too, is generally relegated to limited roles, such as AFK farming. 

Some success can be acquired by focusing on its strengths. While turreted weapons on all sides heavily diminishes damage capacity, turrets on a single side allows a player to compensate for its low maneuverability while leaving the other side for higher-damage gimballed weapons. While it shield capacity is low, its shield regeneration is undiminished, and it can take particular advantage from Guardian Shield Reinforcements, which offer nearly twice the benefit when compared to a Cutter. And with the heaviest armor in the game, it has the greatest capability to remain in a fight once its shields have gone down. Taken together, the Type 10 has the capacity to compete with other ships, though not necessarily to defeat them outright.

## Trivia

- The Type-10 Defender's existence was accidentally revealed on August 17, 2017, in an in-game list of Multicrew-capable ships.^[3]^ It was immediately speculated to be a renamed Panther Clipper, a heavy cargo ship which had been expected for years and hinted at in concept art for Elite Dangerous: Horizons, but this was debunked by Frontier Developments.^[4]^ Frontier subsequently teased an unidentified new ship that was assumed to be the Type-10 in a trailer for upcoming 2.4 content at Frontier Expo 2017, but it was not until December 15, 2017 that the ship was officially announced via the weekly Elite Dangerous Newsletter.^[5]^ The Type-10 was finally made available in-game on December 20, 2017 as part of update 2.4, The Return.
- Upon its initial release, the Type-10 retained the same Cargo capacity as the Type-9, in addition to having superior performance in almost all other areas. In the next patch, the Type-9 received an additional Class 8 compartment, bringing its total cargo capacity closer to the Imperial Cutter's.
- The Type-10's cockpit interior is completely identical to that of its template and predecessor, the Type-9 Heavy.
- The Type-10's original in-game description used to read: *"The Type-10 Defender is the result of collaboration between the Alliance and Lakon Spaceways. With the threat of xeno-war looming, the Alliance's naval arm saw the urgent need for a weapons platform capable of withstanding heavy, sustained attack. Utilising a reinforced Type-9 chassis as a starting point, Lakon overhauled and geared every aspect of the design for combat, producing a military behemoth that could be produced in volume at short notice."* This was likely revised because the Anti-Xeno (AX) community unanimously agreed that it is a poor AX ship and were very vocal in their opinion of the ship.
- The ship's small wings are extended during flight, but will fold up when landing gear is deployed.
