### Federation Battles Independents in the Azaladshu System

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

This was sparked by Azaladshu Free withdrawing from the Federation, which transformed Azaladshu, LFT 824, LHS 277 and LTT 3919 into independent systems. The faction strenuously opposes government monitoring of Federal citizens’ private communications.

Three other Federal factions are on the verge of declaring independence: Coalition of Uteran, Lp 726-6 Free and Gluscap Labour. All are closely monitoring the situation in Azaladshu and considering their next move.

Mayor Constanza Noguera, leader of Azaladshu Free, made this statement:

“We refuse to accept the Federation’s draconian surveillance laws. I call upon all supporters of independence to help us fight for our sovereignty!”

The declaration brought a swift reaction from President Zachary Hudson:

“As Azaladshu Free has violated the Federal Accord, I have no option but to order Neche Inc to engage with these criminals. Thanks to advance intelligence on the secession, we were able to establish the megaship Fortress Liberty in the system to help retake it for the Federation.”

In Congress, Shadow President Felicia Winters faced criticism for allowing the secession to occur within her sphere of influence. She reiterated that she does not support rebellion, but does consider the Proactive Detection Bureau to be unconstitutional.

### 'Salvation' Eclipses Aegis to Obtain Guardian Artefacts

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Rival delivery campaigns by Aegis Research and Taurus Mining Ventures in the PMD2009 48 system have concluded.

Guardian artefacts were delivered to the megaship Glorious Prospect, which was contracted on behalf of the anonymous ‘Salvation’, in greater quantities than to the Aegis megaship Archimedes.

Patience Middleton congratulated those who supported Taurus Mining Ventures:

“This is a clear show of faith in the noble goals of ‘Salvation’. As a further sign of our commitment to those goals, we are pleased to provide the top 75% of contributors a specially engineered Class 2 Fixed Guardian Shard Cannon.”

The Pilots Federation has issued a caution that any ship modules offered by Taurus Mining Ventures will be automatically marked as ‘‘hot’, requiring extra costs to be cleaned prior to installation.

### Dredger Clan Arrives at Kumo City

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

A Blue Viper Club dredger has entered the Pegasi Sector PN-T C3-14 system, and may have links with the Kumo Crew syndicate.

The Dredger-class bulk cruiser has taken position near Kumo City, one of five starports recently constructed by pirate warlord Archon Delaine.

Dredger Clans are nomadic communities that travel on the fringes of civilisation, and their ancient vessels are rarely seen. Pilots in Pegasi Sector PN-T C3-14 have been warned to keep a safe distance from the dredger.

Francesca Wolfe of the Wallglass Investigations Agency published her observations:

“The Blue Viper Club is a fiercely independent tribe with an unsavoury reputation. Dredger Clans typically survive by gathering materials and salvage, but these people indulge in more criminal behaviour including drug running and raiding outposts.”

“The clan occupies more than one dredger, but these have never entered an inhabited system before now. There has been no conflict with local factions or system security. However, unmarked personnel shuttles have been witnessed travelling to and from the dredger.”

“Are we looking at a piratical alliance between the Blue Viper Club and the Kumo Crew? Is Archon Delaine expanding his reach to the Dredger Clans? Or have they brought him something of value that they discovered in deep space?”

## 05 JUL

### NMLA Political Wing Causes Controversy

The NMLA paramilitary group has confirmed that the Marlinism Reformation Party faction now acts as its political representative.

An anonymous statement was broadcast via the NMLA’s propaganda channels:

“We support Minister Whyte in representing the Neo-Marlinist cause and speaking on our behalf. Our objectives remain unchanged – the removal of the Duval family and democratic elections within the Empire.”

Reactions were covered by several newsfeeds:

The Imperial Herald: “Senator Scordato’s proposal to open diplomatic relations with the Marlinist Colonies is already contentious. But could the Emperor ever accept dialogue with the extremists who tried to murder the Imperial Family?”

The Federal Times: “The idea of negotiating with terrorists is as abhorrent to the Empire as to the Federation. And yet, the opportunity to prevent another ‘Nine Martyrs’ cannot be ignored.”

The Alliance Tribune: “In the absence of any breakthroughs from ACT, perhaps peaceful discussion is how we defuse the terrorist threat... even if that was the NMLA’s endgame all along.”

The Marlin Standard: “Many of our people welcome closer ties with the Empire, especially if it involves contacting friends and families left behind. But the NMLA using our parliament as its platform has caused widespread unrest. With Aaron Whyte being openly challenged by other ministers, a Marlinist civil war no longer seems unthinkable.”

## 08 JUL

### Independence Spreads from Azaladshu System

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The Azaladshu Free faction has defeated the forces of Neche Inc and retained independence from the Federation.

As a result, the Azaladshu, LFT 824, LHS 277 and LTT 3919 systems have confirmed their independent status. The victory also inspired the Coalition of Uteran, Lp 726-6 Free and Gluscap Labour factions to secede from the Federation, affecting all systems under their control.

Mayor Constanza Noguera, leader of Azaladshu Free, declared:

“A Federation that abuses the rights of its people has no authority. With the help of our loyal supporters, we’ve made a stand for dignity and civil rights.”

The situation has caused turmoil in Congress, with President Zachary Hudson being criticised for his inability to contain this rebellion.

Shadow President Felicia Winters responded to accusations that she orchestrated the seceding factions:

“I support their rejection of our harsh surveillance laws, but not their methods of protest. I have no wish to see the Federation lose member systems for any reason.”

Pilots who supported the Azaladshu Free faction can collect their rewards at Eratosthenes Ring station.

### Kumo Crew Initiative to Produce New Commodity

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The Kumo Crew syndicate is requesting deliveries to mass-produce a recreational drug named ‘helix’.

The drug is believed to originate with the Blue Viper Club, a nomadic clan travelling aboard an ancient dredger that recently appeared near Kumo City station.

Arch-Corsair Kay Volantyne, representing the Kumo Council, provided details to local newsfeed The Pegasi Sentinel:

“Helix will change lives across the galaxy! Derived from high-quality organic crops, and with many medicinal and psychological benefits, it is guaranteed to bring contentment.”

“All we need to kick-start manufacture are deliveries of agronomic treatment, liquid oxygen and performance enhancers to Kumo City in the Pegasi Sector PN-T C3-14 system. The Kumo Council also offers generous bounties on all wanted ships to protect traders carrying these commodities.”

Many authorities have registered concern that this will exacerbate drug addiction and misuse, which are common social problems. However, some markets have shown interest in the potential new product.

Vox Galactica has reported rumours that helix may be a previously unknown strain of onionhead, a highly popular psychedelic. It remains unknown whether the Blue Viper Club cultivated helix aboard their dredger or acquired it from another source.

## 09 JUL

### Scriveners Clan Abandons the Hesperus

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The dredger belonging to the Scriveners Clan has left the Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system, where the Hesperus megaship is located.

The 200-year-old ‘ghost ship’, once owned by Azimuth Biochemicals, was discovered in April when the nomadic clan began salvaging it for materials and data.

Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency speculated:

“When the Scriveners laid claim to the Hesperus, I expected only a cloud of fragments would remain. But their salvage operation has been prematurely abandoned, after stripping the megaship’s innards and leaving behind a mostly intact hull.”

“Why have they done this? Perhaps because this particular dredger clan avoids outsiders. Public interest in the Hesperus inspired thousands of curious travellers to see it for themselves, potentially drawing more scrutiny than the secretive tribe could bear.”

“Alternatively, the Scriveners detected richer pickings elsewhere – either fresh resources for the dredger to consume or new information for their ‘Knowledge Core’. In theory they could still be tracked down as their vessel’s hyperdrive has a similar range to modern-day fleet carriers.”

“We know very little about the Scriveners, and even less about other clans. However, with the recent appearance of the Blue Viper Club dredger at Kumo City, I’m hopeful more may be revealed about these roaming societies.”

## 12 JUL

### The Story of Onionhead

A new product being manufactured by the Kumo Crew could be a version of onionhead, the controversial recreational drug.

Dr Himari Grey, an independent healthcare analyst, published this review on Vox Galactica:

“Little is yet known about ‘helix’, but the persistent rumour that it is derived from onionhead has sparked keen interest from physicians, politicians and narcotics users alike.”

“Onionhead’s active ingredient is extracted from plant seeds found only on Panem in the Kappa Fornacis system. Its psychotropic and hallucinogenic qualities are well documented, but there is conflicting evidence regarding addictive strength and toxicology.”

“This didn’t stop it being banned in the Federation in 3300 by former President Jasmina Halsey, who was concerned about its popularity among youth culture. Political fireworks followed when Fleet Admiral Vincent bombed onionhead crops against her orders, which five years later led to the Scythe of Panem terrorists seeking revenge.”

“Production soon shifted to the Tanmark system, where the Lucan onionhead strain boosted its popularity. Two further variants have appeared since, a result of enterprising genetic engineers modifying the seeds to flourish in different ecospheres.”

“Could helix be another strain? The Interstellar Health Organisation (IHO) is currently acquiring samples for analysis, so we’ll soon know if this marks a new chapter in onionhead’s notorious story.”

## 13 JUL

### Marlinist Colonies Face Political Division

The Marlinist Consulate, established to represent Marlinists across the galaxy, has triggered political instability among the colonies.

Local newsfeed The Marlin Standard detailed the situation:

“The formation of the Marlinist Consulate will shortly conclude with the public election of its leader. The prime consul will serve as the official Marlinist representative to the superpowers, establish foreign embassies and make wide-reaching diplomatic decisions.”

“One of the two leading candidates is Verity Dexter from the Marlinism Reformation Party, who promises to speak for the Neo-Marlinist fringe. The Free Marlinist Movement’s candidate, Kayode Tau, directly opposes that position.”

“Senator Lorcan Scordato has championed Dexter’s bid, proposing that she be recognised as an Imperial patron to represent pro-Marlinist citizens of the Empire. Despite many protests, Chancellor Blaine concurred that patronage is within the purview of individual senators.”

“Some Marlinists see this as a chance to finally obtain influence in the Senate, after centuries of being marginalised. Others are enraged at Neo-Marlinists gaining legitimacy and acting as the NMLA’s political wing.”

“The rift has affected parliament, where First Minister Fairfax again urged Minister Aaron Whyte to cease representing the NMLA and hand over all information to ACT. Whyte retorted that his diplomatic breakthroughs would soon make the counter-terrorism unit redundant.”

## 15 JUL

### Kumo Crew Campaign Starts Drug Production

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The Kumo Crew syndicate has procured enough materials to introduce a new product to the market.

The drug originated with the Blue Viper Club, a piratical travelling community whose dredger is currently in the vicinity of Kumo City station.

It was confirmed that enough shipments of agronomic treatment, liquid oxygen and performance enhancers were received to enable immediate mass production. Pilots also fought to protect haulage vessels from pirate ships, suspected to be Kumo Crew rivals.

The Interstellar Health Organisation has obtained a product sample and confirmed that, despite the name ‘helix’, it is a new variant of the recreational drug onionhead. As such, the product will be legally classified as onionhead gamma strain when it appears on the market.

Despite claims of medicinal and psychological benefits, it is likely to be illegal in most systems. President Zachary Hudson, Princess Aisling Duval and several other political heavyweights have expressed outrage at the open manner by which its ingredients were procured.

Archon Delaine, warlord of the Kumo Crew, responded:

“Every system government generates revenue from the pharmaceutical trade, so the holier-than-thou attitude from these hypocrites turns my stomach. Helix brings happiness, and provides income for my people. I make no apologies!”

Rewards for pilots who contributed to this campaign are now available at Kumo City in the Pegasi Sector PN-T C3-14 system.

### Data Required for Marlinist Election

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Rival candidates have requested deliveries of data to help secure their bids to lead the Marlinist Consulate.

The Marlinist Colonies are voting for who will be elected as their prime consul. This influential role will diplomatically represent all Marlinists and make broad decisions on their behalf.

The first candidate is Verity Dexter from the Marlinism Reformation Party, which is acting as the NMLA political wing. She has the support of Senator Lorcan Scordato to be made an Imperial patron:

“I am in a unique position to finally provide our people with a voice in the Imperial Senate, and to speak for Neo-Marlinists. As prime consul, I will negotiate a permanent peace with the NMLA.”

The second candidate, Kayode Tau of the Free Marlinist Movement, is focused on sustaining the Marlinist Colonies:

“Neo-Marlinism and terrorism have no place within our republican ideals. I will strive to keep our systems independent, and to protect the rights of peaceful Marlinists everywhere.”

In order to help secure their campaigns, both candidates have requested deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data and unusual encrypted files. Shipments for Verity Dexter should be delivered to Stillman Hub in the HIP 22550 system, while those for Kayode Tau are expected at Tilman Point in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system.

The Alliance, Empire and Federation have recognised the Marlinist Consulate as an ambassadorial body, and agreed that the election of its prime consul is a strictly internal matter.

### Galactic Mysteries: The Far God Cult

The enigmatic Thargoid-worshipping religious order is examined by Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency.

“Of all the myriad faiths practised across the galaxy, the Far God cult is one of the strangest and least understood. But in recent years it has grown from a fringe sect to a widespread religion.”

“Its central tenet is that an unknowable being exists beyond our dimension – the Far God. What we call the Thargoids are its heralds, preparing for when it descends from hyperspace to instantly wipe out all life. This apocalyptic creed therefore attracts people who have nothing to live for, and who find purpose in awaiting armageddon.”

“The cult has no official name or spokespeople, and its followers willingly replace their names with titles such as adherent, disciple and witness. This dehumanising approach includes its members wearing simple black robes and making their hive-chapels resemble Thargoid bio-technology, complete with ammonia fumes.”

“Despite praying to an alien species, this is not the Thargoid fifth column many feared it to be. In fact they are pacifistic fatalists, expecting death and never offering resistance. This has caused them to be victimised by other doomsayer cults, anti-xeno activists and even the Federal Intelligence Agency… yet their serene patience has allowed them to survive.”

“The discovery of two abandoned void-temples in the Etain system provided an insight into the cultists’ mindset. Here can be heard the final testaments of people willingly entombed in suspended animation to await the Far God’s arrival.”

“More recently there are reports of several chapters of the sect migrating to the Panjabell system. This is controlled by the Pleiades Concordat, a theocracy devoted to the Far God, so perhaps it is preparing something bigger – or stranger – than we’ve seen before.”

## 20 JUL

### IHO Reports on New Onionhead Variant

The Interstellar Health Organisation has published a preliminary analysis of onionhead gamma strain, a recreational drug also known as ‘helix’.

“As with the alpha, beta and Lucan strains, the active component is derived from seeds produced by the onionhead flower native to the planet Panem. These contain alkaloid compounds that have a temporary psychoactive effect on human perceptions and cognitive functions.”

“In the gamma strain, these compounds have been genetically modified using synthetic molecules of unknown origin. This has diluted the concentration of psychotropics, therefore producing less intense hallucinogenic episodes.”

“The practical advantages of these modifications are twofold. First, they allow onionhead to be economically mass-produced using artificial environments rather than grown as natural crops. Second, the gamma strain is more hardy and able to survive for longer periods in storage or sub-zero temperatures.”

Dr Himari Grey, an independent healthcare analyst, commented:

“The IHO’s report suggests we are looking at a type of onionhead designed to be sold in greater volume than previous variants. Its sophisticated composition means it is unlikely to have been developed by the Blue Viper Club. It’s possible that the nomads acquired it from an unidentified research facility, and have now cut a deal with the Kumo Crew for distribution.”

## 21 JUL

### Federation Threatened by Further Secession

More Federal factions are considering declaring independence following the recent conflict in the Azaladshu system.

Sofia Trevino, political journalist with The Federal Times, published an overview of the situation:

“When Azaladshu Free seceded in reaction to the government’s surveillance laws, it inspired three other factions to do the same, making ten systems and a billion people independent. Superpowers routinely gain and lose systems via local politics, but this was a rare instance of member factions abandoning their fealty.”

“The newly sovereign nations have severed all links with the Proactive Detection Bureau, so their communications are no longer being monitored. Despite broad public support for the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, many citizens still consider personal privacy to be a constitutional right.”

“Dozens of other factions are now considering independence. This affects only a small percentage of the systems under Federal control, but is highly embarrassing for President Hudson as well as Shadow President Winters – her organised resistance to the surveillance laws is what inspired factions to secede.”

“Advocacy, the civil rights organisation, claims that the Federal Intelligence Agency has begun arresting secessionist ringleaders under spurious charges. If true, it suggests that the government will go to any lengths to prevent a full-scale rebellion spreading throughout the Federation.”

## 22 JUL

### Free Marlinist Candidate Wins Election

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Kayode Tau has been elected as prime consul for the Marlinists, following a successful data delivery initiative.

The candidate from the Free Marlinist Movement faction received more public votes than rival nominee Verity Dexter. His campaign was supported by deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data and unusual encrypted files in greater quantities.

Prime Consul Tau will now serve as the lead ambassador for the Marlinist Colonies in all dealings with the superpowers. He gave this statement to the media:

“The Marlinist Consulate will act to preserve our colonies’ independence, and improve diplomatic relations with the rest of the galaxy. Let me be clear – we do not represent the extremist views of Neo-Marlinism. Our consuls will assist all efforts to eliminate the NMLA.”

In the Marlinist Parliament, Minister Aaron Whyte protested that ignoring the Neo-Marlinist fringe was “a provocative act that could inflame further violence”. First Minister Jenna Fairfax called for the result of the democratic vote to be respected.

Pilots who supported Kayode Tau can now collect their rewards from Tilman Point in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-6 system.

### Initiative to Outfit Far God Megaships

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The Pleiades Concordat has requested deliveries to support the Far God cult in the Panjabell system.

Members of the secretive Thargoid-worshipping sect have gathered in huge numbers, and are preparing to outfit one or more megaships for religious purposes.

Although the cult has no official spokespeople, local newsfeeds carried a brief message from one of its senior members, known only as the First Herald of the Fifty-Eighth Chapter:

“The faithful have hidden in the shadows for too long. Now is the time to reach out and welcome the Far God, with the support of our friends in the Pleiades Concordat.”

“The first megaship, the Testament, will be a missionary vessel to spread the word to all humankind. If we are blessed enough to obtain commodities for more megaships, these will be sent on a pilgrimage into deep space to commune with the Far God.”

The Pleiades Concordat has requested that pilots deliver auto fabricators, emergency power cells and insulating membrane to Moore Hub in the Panjabell system.

Far God believers are generally accepted to be non-threatening, albeit controversial due to their reverence of the Thargoids. As the cultists are routinely targeted by anti-xeno extremists, the Pleiades Concordat has placed bounties on all wanted ships to protect deliveries.

## 23 JUL

### New Onionhead Variant Reaches the Market

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Onionhead gamma strain is now available in selected industrial anarchy systems.

Following the Kumo Council’s initiative, enough product was manufactured to supply approximately 10% of all industrial-based markets controlled by anarchic factions. Unlike previous versions of onionhead, this variant is not listed as a rare commodity.

Adalyn Cross, a journalist for Vox Galactica, reported:

“Onionhead gamma strain is being marketed to the public for medicinal use, but most customers are under no illusions regarding its real benefits. The Coalition for Legalisation claims that it is ‘no more harmful or addictive than alcohol or coffee, with potential psychological and palliative benefits’.”

“This has not prevented many authorities, especially in the Federation, from demanding that it remain universally outlawed. It is currently illegal in all but anarchy jurisdictions. There are serious concerns that it may act as a gateway drug to more harmful substances. Security services are also unhappy about the extra revenue flowing into Archon Delaine’s coffers.”

“Some logistics experts noted that onionhead gamma strain was distributed with surprising speed. It is already being reported as available from the following systems: Alici, Baraswar, Kishpakho, Nastrond and Nocori. It’s been suggested that Sirius Corporation is secretly ferrying shipments of the drug via its freight transportation network, and is part of the deal between the Kumo Crew and the Blue Viper Club. Sinclair Faraldo, VP of Corporate Marketing, rejected this claim as ‘absurd and libellous’.”

## 26 JUL

### Federal Surveillance Sabotages Independence

Communications intercepted by the Proactive Detection Bureau are being used to prevent further factions from leaving the Federation.

A report by the civil rights organisation Advocacy proves that the Federal Intelligence Agency is targeting pro-independence individuals via their private messages. In many cases, they are being arrested for planning to commit crimes against the constitution.

Deputy Director Bethany Blake, who runs the PDB, gave a statement to the media:

“I can confirm that gathering such intelligence is within our legal remit. Unilateral declarations of independence are criminal acts that violate the Federal Accord. Therefore we are identifying perpetrators before they cause harm, which is precisely what our surveillance network was established to do.”

In Congress, Vice President Jerome Archer defended the PDB for boosting arrest rates and saving lives. However, Congressman Bai Zheng remarked that the PDB was “incapable of locating the NMLA, but fantastic at finding enemies among our own people that didn’t previously exist”.

Both President Hudson and Shadow President Winters have personally contacted the leaders of many systems within their spheres of influence, aiming to address their concerns and convince them not to secede from the Federation.

## 27 JUL

### Aegis Investigated After Megaship Loss

The superpowers have partly suspended Aegis and authorised an inquiry into the Alexandria megaship, which disappeared in hyperspace.

Freelance journalist Alexei Keel reported on this development for Vox Galactica:

“Public opinion regarding Aegis has always been chequered, but its founding governments insisted that it played a vital defensive role against the Thargoids. The tragic loss of the Alexandria, carrying thousands of crewmembers and valuable Guardian artefacts, has now raised questions about the organisation’s competence.”

“The Alliance, Empire and Federation have jointly ordered an independent inquiry to determine the facts about the Alexandria. Many Aegis operations were shut down, and detailed investigations have begun. Professor Alba Tesreau and other senior members have already been forced to resign.”

“Part of the reason for such scrutiny is the emergence of the anonymous ‘Salvation’, who many view as running an alternative anti-xeno effort. Some security agencies suspect him to be the leader of an Aegis splinter group, composed of rogue agents and stolen resources.”

## 29 JUL

### Far God Megaship Initiative Concludes

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Independent pilots have supported the Far God cult by delivering commodities to the Panjabell system.

The Pleiades Concordat paid for shipments of auto fabricators, emergency power cells and insulating membrane transported to Moore Hub station. These will be used to outfit megaships that will be populated by the Thargoid-worshipping cultists.

Local reporters spoke to one of the sect’s newest converts, Leonard Yates from Agassiz Settlement, now known as the Eighty-Ninth Adherent of the Sixtieth Chapter:

“The beneficence of the galactic community is deeply appreciated. Our missionary megaship, the Testament, will help carry news of the oncoming apocalypse to every system.”

“The other megaships – the Perdition and the Sacrosanct – will soon embark on a holy pilgrimage. They will carry thousands of us faithful worshippers into the void to commune with the Far God and hasten Its arrival.”

Pilots who contributed to the Pleiades Concordat’s initiative can now collect their rewards from Moore Hub in the Panjabell system.

### NMLA Attacks Marlinist Starports

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The NMLA has bombed two starports in the HIP 22550 and Hyades Sector RO-P b6-6 systems in the Marlinist Colonies.

Explosive devices were detonated at both Stillman Hub and Tilman Point stations. As is characteristic of weapons used by the NMLA, caustic enzyme payloads caused widespread corrosive damage.

The combined death toll is in the tens of thousands, with many more injured. There are unconfirmed reports that First Minister Jenna Fairfax is among the fatalities.

The following message was broadcast via NMLA propaganda channels:

“Why are they bombing their own homes? Why would Theta Seven kill his own people? Because they are not our homes! Not my people! They are prisons, not colonies, where traitors to the cause beg for scraps from those who exiled them. True Marlinists will never stop fighting until the Republic of Achenar is restored.”

The attacks are believed to be in response to Verity Dexter failing to win a public vote to lead the Marlinist Consulate, where she would have represented the NMLA political wing.

Prime Consul Kayode Tau, the elected candidate, announced:

“I call upon the galactic community to provide humanitarian aid to Stillman Hub in HIP 22550 and Tilman Point in Hyades Sector RO-P b6-6. We urgently require ships to evacuate the people trapped within these starports to safety.”

## 30 JUL

### Rebellion Spreads Across Federal Systems

New Kuwembaa Labour, which controls five systems, has triggered a second wave of secession by severing ties with the Federation.

Following the victory of the Azaladshu Free, a minority of Federal factions are breaking away from the superpower in protest against its civil surveillance laws.

Governor Sonal Mishra of New Kuwembaa Labour made this statement:

“The Federal government has granted itself draconian powers to spy on its own citizens. Regrettably, the only way to avoid this is to withdraw from the Federal Accord. I urge the president to respect our wishes and accept our sovereign status.”

In response, President Zachary Hudson ordered Governor Mishra to abide by constitutional law or face the consequences. He has also redirected the Fortress Liberty megaship to the Kuwembaa system.

Political commentators believe that three other democratic Federal factions are ready to follow the example of New Kuwembaa Labour. If this occurs, up to 28 further systems could become independent as a result.

There are also reports that influential leaders within the Coalition of Uteran and Gluscap Labour, which both recently seceded, have expressed regret about leaving the Federation. The congressmen who previously represented them believe that these factions could be swayed to return.
