**Great Annihilator** is an uninhabited system in the Empyrean Straits. It contains two black holes and five stars. Great Annihilator A compresses approximately 198 solar masses within 0.0008 solar radii, and is the largest known black hole in the galaxy, not including the supermassive black hole at Sagittarius A\*.^[1]^Â Great Annihilator B contains about 66 solar masses within 0.003 solar radii.

The Great Annihilator is one of the brightest gamma-ray sources found in the Milky Way galaxy. It produces massive amounts of pairs of photons at 511 keV, which usually indicates the annihilation of an electron-positron pair (thus, the name). The Great Annihilator also has a radio source counterpart which emits jets that are about three light years long. These jets are probably synchrotron emissions from positron-electron pairs streaming out at high velocities from the source of antimatter.^[2]^

## Human presence

The Great Annihilator is the center of the *Azura* initiative, a player project to build a "mini-bubble" by maintaining a number of Fleet Carriers in the area and conducting independent trade. CMDRs can expect a range of services in the area. A number of fleet carriers offer services on the route between this site and the core bubble.^[3]^
