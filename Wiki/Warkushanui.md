**Warkushanui** is an Independent system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. In October 3301, it became ground zero for a wave of technical issues affecting its starports that soon appeared in dozens of other systems across inhabited space. The technical issues were eventually traced to the illegal trade in Thargoid commodities, such as the Thargoid Sensor and Thargoid Probe, which would automatically break down surrounding technology that was not protected by Meta-Alloys to sustain themselves.

## Timeline

28 OCT 3301

- Officials at Gurragchaa Gateway announced that all station services were suspended due to the mysterious technical issues, and that they were "still trying to determine the cause of the problem." An official Federal travel warning was issued soon after, telling pilots to avoid the system entirely.^[1]^

22 OCT 3301

- A mechanic at Gurragchaa Gateway described "malfunctions and breakdowns cropping up all over the starport" with "no obvious cause". When asked by the Federal Times if the Anomalous Extraterrestrial Objects discovered in the system could be the cause, staff on the station said that "all available lines of enquiry were being explored".^[2]^

16 OCT 3301

- GalNet reported on the escalating problem in the Warkushanui system with technical issues in starports. Sam Norris, a technician on Coats Hub, described "power outages, intermittent problems with our communications, and issues with the docking systems," as well as being unable to communicate with Gurragchaa Gateway.^[3]^
