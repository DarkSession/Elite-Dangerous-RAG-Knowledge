### Alliance Election Delayed due to Galactic Summit

The Alliance Assembly has agreed to delay electing a new prime minister to avoid clashing with the forthcoming Galactic Summit.

The proposal to postpone the election date came from Prime Minister Edmund Mahon:

“Now that the diplomatic conference has been confirmed, we must adapt to take advantage of this historic event. A potential change in leadership occurring at the same time as the Galactic Summit would cause confusion and undermine the Alliance’s presence.”

Although Mahon’s proposal was voted through by a narrow margin, many council members disagreed with altering the political calendar. Councillor Nakato Kaine, who is a candidate in the election, declared:

“It is outrageous that the prime minister is using this as an excuse to extend his term in office. Once again, he is more concerned with projecting the Alliance as a superpower than the interests of member systems. This behaviour is what you’d expect from a corrupt emperor or president, clinging onto power at any cost.”

The Assembly has rescheduled the election to take place three months later in May 3307, although this remains only provisional.

## 02 FEB

### Core Dynamics Implicated in Starship One Sabotage

Evidence presented at the trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent suggested financial links to Federal shipbuilding corporation Core Dynamics.

This significant development was covered by Ethan Takahashi for The Federal Times:

“The initial investigations around Starship One’s destruction in 3301 were outlined by the prosecution. When the Federal Attorney’s Office revisited this historical data, traces were found of financial transfers routed through non-Federation banking systems.”

“The FAO brought in the expertise of the Wallglass Investigations Agency, which discovered that these transactions were made via shell companies created by Core Dynamics. Fleet Admiral Vincent, as well as several other naval officers, received billions of credits through these companies that went undeclared.”

“Vincent refused to answer any questions about this evidence, once again claiming that he is the victim of a conspiracy to hand the presidency to Felicia Winters.”

Despite multiple requests from the press, Core Dynamics has not made any public comment. There are unverified reports of large-scale activity taking place at some of the corporation’s centres of operation.

## 03 FEB

### Empire Denies Existence of Secret Prison

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

An Imperial Intelligence detention facility discovered in the R CRA Sector AF-A d42 system has been repudiated by the Empire.

The outpost, named Serene Harbour, was located after its distress call was shared publicly by the Pilots Federation. According to the Commander Andee-X- who first investigated the site, all its occupants were dead as the result of what appeared to be a prisoner breakout.

Unlike the Imperial Internal Security Service, the Imperial Intelligence organisation has no spokespeople or public channels. However, Senator Karl Nerva told the media:

“The claim that high-security prisoners and terrorists are being tortured for information in an unregistered outpost is categorically false. There is no such place as ‘Serene Harbour’.”

“We believe that independent pilots have been duped by a Federal ploy to undermine the Empire, using fake locations and logs for theatrical effect. I assure all citizens that Imperial Intelligence operates fully within the law and remains vigilant against all threats.”

When asked about Commandant Gabriel De Luca, who was identified by surviving logs at the outpost, Senator Nerva replied:

“Captain De Luca was indeed an agent of Imperial Intelligence, but died on active duty several years ago. It’s obvious that this respected hero’s identity has been stolen to add credibility to anti-Imperial disinformation.”

## 04 FEB

### Engineer's Enhanced Missile Rack Initiative

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The engineer Liz Ryder has requested mined materials to help make a previously unique ship module widely available.

The module is a fully engineered lightweight and high capacity Class 2 Seeker Missile Rack with thermal cascade. It was offered in October 3306 to pilots who helped defend the Eurybia system from Imperial forces. At the time, the Empire suspected Liz Ryder of supplying weapons to the NMLA terrorist group.

Ms Ryder has announced that her aim is to make this specially modified weapon available for purchase at all human technology brokers. She added:

“Pilots can help kick-start this project by providing mined commodities, which will temporarily reduce the amount of materials that customers require to obtain the missile rack. As a bonus, the highest contributors to this initiative will be gifted with the module.”

“I’m pleased to be working with tech brokers to add this to the market. Many engineers think we could do more to serve the galactic community, and this is a step in that direction.”

Shipments of bromellite, lithium hydroxide, osmium and samarium can be delivered to Awyra Flirble in the Eurybia system.

## 05 FEB

### Jupiter Rochester Named in Starship One Trial

Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester has been accused of collaborating with Fleet Admiral Vincent to orchestrate Starship One’s destruction in 3301.

As reported by Ethan Takahashi for The Federal Times:

“Financial data was presented to the court showing that Vincent, along with others in government and the Federal Navy, received colossal payments via shell companies created by Jupiter Rochester’s loyalists.”

“The prosecution claimed that Rochester and Vincent were reacting to then-President Jasmina Halsey’s intention to scale back military spending, which would impact Core Dynamics’s profits. They arranged to assassinate her and lay groundwork for Zachary Hudson to be voted into power, knowing that his policies would result in further naval contracts.”

“The defence argued that Halsey’s testimony was unreliable, and that the financial data was obtained via improper methods so should have been inadmissible. It was also pointed out that the Rochester family had many enemies determined to besmirch their reputation.”

“The jury has now been sequestered to determine a verdict. This means they are unaware of media reports that several Core Dynamics departments, known collectively as ‘Jupiter Division’, are transporting ships and personnel to the HIP 54530 system.”

Other sources confirmed that the HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group has officially assumed the name Jupiter Division, suggesting that it was heavily infiltrated by Rochester’s loyalists. The faction has retained control of the permit-locked HIP 54530 system.

## 08 FEB

### Warning of Ship Abductions by Fleet Carriers

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

This is an emergency bulletin to alert independent pilots that kidnappers are operating in the vicinity of the HR 6828 system.

The Pilots Federation has received reports of untrustworthy offers being made to Commanders who recently obtained their pilot’s licence.

These involve the owners of Drake-class fleet carriers enticing a pilot to outfit their ship for mining operations, before docking with the larger vessel. It then makes a series of jumps, to a distant star system over 800 light years away, taking the docked ship with it.

The Commander is encouraged to work on mining hotspots in order to produce income for the fleet carrier. However, their own ship’s limited jump range means they are effectively marooned, and reliant upon the fleet carrier to be returned to their starting system.

All pilots are therefore advised to beware of hails directing them to HR 6828 or systems in that area. It is also important to exercise extreme caution when docking with any fleet carrier whose owner is unknown.

The Pilots Federation has requested that this bulletin be shared by all members across public channels. It has also been distributed to major newsfeeds including The Alliance Tribune, The Federal Times, The Imperial Herald and Vox Galactica.

### Fleet Admiral Vincent Pronounced Guilty

A Federal High Court jury has found Fleet Admiral Lucas Vincent guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and treason.

The court heard how Vincent worked with Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester to sabotage Starship One and assassinate then-President Jasmina Halsey, in order to increase military contracts.

The Federal Times’s crime correspondent Ethan Takahashi observed:

“Within minutes of Vincent receiving a life sentence, Federal Intelligence Agency teams arrested several co-conspirators in the Federal Navy along with some government officials.”

“Jupiter Rochester himself has evaded arrest by fleeing to the HIP 54530 system, where loyalists within Core Dynamics are establishing a breakaway faction named Jupiter Division. Industry analysts believe that this corporate split has long been planned, but is being accelerated because of the trial.”

“Rochester’s responsibility for the Starship One tragedy raises many questions, especially for his powerful family. It will certainly fuel the conspiracy theory that he is a member of a covert group of powerful figures, who manipulate events to benefit the military/industrial complex.”

“However, a more plausible theory – that Zachary Hudson was responsible – now seems to have been debunked. Nothing presented in court suggested that the president had any involvement in, or knowledge of, the plan to eliminate his predecessor.”

## 09 FEB

### Jupiter Rochester Goes Rogue from Core Dynamics

Several departments loyal to the Core Dynamics CEO have seceded to form an independent corporate republic called Jupiter Division.

During the recent trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent, Jupiter Rochester was named as the paymaster behind the sabotage of Starship One. This hastened long-term plans to abscond from Core Dynamics along with many ships and personnel.

In the permit-locked HIP 54530 system, the HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group has been renamed as Jupiter Division. It is assumed to have long been infiltrated by Rochester’s loyalists.

Using the new self-appointed title of Supreme Executive Rochester, he broadcast this statement across all Federal media channels:

“For many years, I helped Core Dynamics become one of the galaxy’s strongest companies, but petty laws and bureaucracy restricted me at every turn. I have always felt that people should not be ruled by politicians, but by those holding true economic power – the corporations.”

“It will be a long time before I can act on my commercial plans, but I will prove that corporate rule is the most beneficial system of governance for the Federation.”

Jupiter Rochester is the eldest son of Shadow Vice President Isolde Rochester, and a key member of the influential Rochester family. As yet there have been no public statements from his mother or siblings.

## 10 FEB

### Takeover of Lakon Spaceways Declared Illegal

The acquisition of Lakon Spaceways by Core Dynamics has been revoked following revelations of illegal activity.

An inquiry by the Independent Commission for Market Equality stated that former Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester “exerted unduly influence on Lakon shareholders, including bribery and blackmail”. This led to new appointees to the board of directors, who were paid to approve the hostile takeover.

The inquiry also factored in the recent Federal High Court trial, which proved that Jupiter Rochester was directly responsible for the destruction of Starship One in 3301. In both cases, he set up shell companies to move enormous funds via unregistered banking systems.

Core Dynamics refused to comment on the allegations, but its legal team has terminated the transfer process. The entire corporation is currently in disarray due to several departments becoming an independent faction under the name Jupiter Division.

At Lakon Spaceways, Trent Delaney and several other directors have resigned. During an emergency meeting, a majority of stakeholders approved reinstating Naomi Landseer as chairperson.

With stock values plummeting and industry confidence low, the future of the company remains uncertain. However, Sirius Corporation confirmed that it has made preliminary offers with regards to acquiring Lakon as a subsidiary.

## 11 FEB

### Conflict Between Federal Forces and Jupiter Division

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Jupiter Division ships have engaged in battle with rival Federal vessels in the HIP 54530 system.

Loyalists to former Core Dynamics CEO Jupiter Rochester have built their own breakaway faction in HIP 54530. The FIA suspects that Jupiter Division agents first infiltrated the HIP 54530 Gold Universal Group years ago, and permit locked the system to conceal their efforts to overtake it from within.

The self-appointed Supreme Executive Rochester declared:

“The Federation is choking to death on its outdated bureaucracy – only corporate rule can save it! But first the galactic community must protect my followers, so I can establish a permanent base of operations.”

Director Theodore Sullivan of the Silver Legal Group announced:

“We will not tolerate these criminals illegally controlling this system. Once victory is won, the Federation will be able to bring Rochester to justice.”

Jupiter Division has offered generous rewards to any pilots willing to help secure its presence in the HIP 54530 system. The Silver Legal Group has asked Federal auxiliaries to support its efforts to degrade Jupiter Division’s military force.

The Pilots Federation has agreed to supply all ships participating in this conflict with temporary permits to access HIP 54530. These will expire early on Thursday the 18th of February 3307.

However, neither permanent nor temporary system permits apply to fleet carriers, since they are capable of ferrying vessels which could evade detection and authorisation.

## 12 FEB

### Enhanced Missile Rack Initiative Concludes

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Deliveries of mined materials have allowed the engineer Liz Ryder to make a one-off modified ship module widely available.

The module is a fully engineered lightweight and high capacity Class 2 Seeker Missile Rack with thermal cascade. It was only available for a brief period in October 3306, but can now be purchased from any human technology broker.

Freshly mined bromellite, lithium hydroxide, osmium and samarium were delivered by a large number of pilots. Due to the volume of shipments received, the initial amount of materials required by customers to purchase the weapon has been temporarily reduced.

Liz Ryder made this statement from her Demolition Unlimited workshop:

“Thank you to everyone who helped launch – so to speak – this module onto the market. I hope that engineers and tech brokers can continue working together on providing more options to the galactic community.”

Pilots who delivered commodities for this initiative can now collect their rewards from Awyra Flirble in the Eurybia system.

### Empire and Marlinists Prepare for Galactic Summit

Delegations have been formed by the Empire and the Marlinist Colonies to take part in the forthcoming diplomatic conference.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval will not attend in person, but will be directly represented by Chancellor Anders Blaine. During the conference, Senator Zemina Torval will temporarily assume chancellor duties and act as head of the Senate.

In addition, Princess Aisling Duval and Senator Denton Patreus will be in attendance. They will be accompanied by experienced ambassadors from the Imperial Diplomatic Corps.

The Marlinist Colonies have also finalised their delegation, which includes First Minister Jenna Fairfax and Minister Aaron Whyte. A spokesperson for the Marlinist Parliament said:

“The Galactic Summit offers us an opportunity to engage with the Empire diplomatically, and we sincerely hope our voices will be heard. We also aim to establish mutually beneficial relations with other governments.”

There is widespread speculation on how the Empire will respond to political overtures from its own ex-citizens, who were persecuted for following the democratic ideology of Marlinism. However, most societies within the Marlinist Colonies still remain culturally Imperial in nature, despite their republican governance.

The Galactic Summit is being hosted by Sirius Corporation and will officially commence on Thursday the 25th of February 3307.

## 15 FEB

### Federation Damaged by Corruption and Conspiracy

Federal citizens are in uproar after the former CEO of Core Dynamics was revealed to have destroyed Starship One to increase company profits.

The trial of Fleet Admiral Vincent showed that Jupiter Rochester attempted to replace Jasmina Halsey with Zachary Hudson to secure military contracts with the Federal Navy.

The Federal Intelligence Agency has arrested several co-conspirators, but its investigation is hampered by Jupiter Rochester loyalists splitting away from Core Dynamics. His new independent faction, Jupiter Division, has engaged in conflict against Federal forces in the HIP 54530 system.

President Hudson has claimed ignorance of the assassination plot, but public opinion polls show a decrease of trust in the Republican Party. Many have voiced anger at such corruption at the heart of the Federation, calling for further investigations into the corporate sector’s influence on government.

Political embarrassment has also affected the Liberal Party, with Shadow Vice President Isolde Rochester attempting to distance herself from her eldest son:

“Jupiter’s horrendous actions were his alone, made completely without our knowledge. My whole family is appalled at his illegal activity. We have offered to aid the authorities in bringing him to justice.”

## 16 FEB

### Alliance Bales Out Lakon Spaceways

The Alliance Assembly has approved purchasing a majority sharehold in Lakon Spaceways, gaining partial ownership of the shipbuilding company.

An acquisition attempt by Federal corporation Core Dynamics was recently revoked due to illegal practices by its former CEO Jupiter Rochester. The Alliance has now rescued Lakon from possible insolvency, using government funding to buy shares and increase investment.

Naomi Landseer, the reinstated chairperson of Lakon’s board of directors, announced:

“We welcome becoming closer partners with the Alliance, which we see as a natural progression following successful collaboration on past projects. I’m pleased to inform customers that the manufacture of Lakon vessels will continue uninterrupted.”

Although some Assembly members voted against the decision, including election candidate Nakato Kaine, there is broad public and industry approval. The Council of Admirals has expressed gratitude that a key defence contractor will not be controlled by another superpower or corporation.

Much of Lakon’s personnel and resources will migrate to Alliance space, although its range of ships will remain available for purchase across the galaxy. Plans to construct a new headquarters for Lakon Spaceways within the Alioth system are well underway.

## 18 FEB

### Victory for Federal Forces Against Jupiter Division

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Jupiter Division, the breakaway faction from Core Dynamics, has been defeated in the HIP 54530 system.

The independent corporate nation met armed resistance from a local faction, the Silver Legal Group, which defeated them in battle with the aid of independent ships. Director Theodore Sullivan announced:

“Thanks to the courage of many pilots, we have crippled the military forces behind this illegal coup and taken control of the system.”

Rewards for all who fought for the Silver Legal Group are available from the Iron Wings of Justice megaship in the Ts'ao Tach system.

The Silver Legal Group has been awarded permit control to prevent any further compromise of Federal assets. Pilots without this permit can perform missions for the faction at the Iron Wings of Justice megaship in Ts'ao Tach to access the HIP 54530 system.

Remnants of Jupiter Division confirmed that despite their defeat, all those who sided with them during the conflict will be reimbursed at the Victory’s Forge megaship in the HIP 55014 system.

The Federal Intelligence Agency has taken Jupiter Rochester into custody, where he will be charged for his involvement in the destruction of Starship One in 3301. Thousands of his loyalist followers have also been apprehended, and the return of stolen Core Dynamics ships and resources is being arranged.

### Rare Goods Required for Galactic Summit

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Sirius Corporation has requested deliveries of consumables to Luyten’s Star for the forthcoming diplomatic conference.

The Galactic Summit will take place in the Sirius system and last for three weeks, beginning on Thursday the 25th of February. It will be attended by leaders from the Alliance, Empire and Federation, plus representatives from independent systems.

Sirius Corporation has placed orders for these rare commodities: Eden Apples Of Aerial, Ethgreze Tea Buds, Gerasian Gueuze Beer, Giant Irukama Snails, Goman Yaupon Coffee, Karsuki Locusts and Lavian Brandy.

All shipments are to be delivered to Ashby City in the Luyten’s Star system. They will then be ferried to Sirius before the conference begins.

CEO Li Yong-Rui discussed these preparations at a media event:

“We will provide all honoured delegates with a comfortable, luxurious environment. This includes offering the finest cuisine from across the galaxy.”

Several journalists pointed out that both the Alliance and Empire had registered official complaints about the Galactic Summit’s location being situated deep within Federal space. Li Yong-Rui responded:

“I assure you that the Sirius system is politically neutral territory, and Sirius Corporation remains independent from the Federation. I can personally guarantee the safety and diplomatic immunity of all attendees.”

## 19 FEB

### Lakon Spaceways HQ Moves to Alioth System

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The capital system of the Alliance now hosts Lakon’s administrative hub and offers a 5% discount on its ships.

The company’s main offices have been relocated to the Lakon Spaceways Central planetary port on Alioth 1 a.

All shipyards within the Alioth system are offering a permanent 5% discount on sales of vessels manufactured by Lakon. Pilots will need to obtain a permit for Alioth to take advantage of this reduction.

Both the move and the discount reflect the Alliance’s recent purchase of a majority sharehold in the company. This was primarily to retain it as a key defence contractor for the Alliance Defence Force.

Naomi Landseer, chairperson of the board of directors, announced:

“We are extremely pleased to be partnered with the Alliance, especially after recent tumultuous events. Lakon’s highly regarded ships will remain available across the galaxy.”

The attempted takeover of Lakon Spaceways by Core Dynamics was revoked due to revelations of illegal practices by its former CEO, Jupiter Rochester. Federal news sources have reported that a rapid restructure is taking place within Core Dynamics, alongside investigations by the Federal Intelligence Agency.

## 22 FEB

### Hudson and Winters Confirmed for Galactic Summit

President Zachary Hudson and Shadow President Felicia Winters will both attend the diplomatic conference in the Sirius system.

The Federation will also be represented by ambassadors from the Federal Diplomatic Corps, as well as several civil and corporate interests.

Political correspondent Sofia Trevino reported for The Federal Times:

“President Hudson’s personal presence at the Galactic Summit sends the message that he still holds the reins of power. He clearly hopes that facing off against the Empire’s leaders will distract the public from the recent Jupiter Rochester scandals.”

“In his absence, Vice President Brad Mitchell will oversee congressional matters. There are rumours that Mitchell is positioning himself to challenge Hudson as the Republican Party candidate in the next election.”

“The conference also offers opportunities for Felicia Winters to appear presidential. She has eagerly agreed to meet the Marlinist Colonies delegation, having coordinated humanitarian aid for the refugees last year.”

“Winters has not asked Shadow VP Isolde Rochester to accompany her, perhaps as a rebuke for the criminal actions of her son. Furiously working on damage control for her family’s name, the Rochester matriarch has taken Jupiter’s two children into her care after his husband, Tomas Turai, filed for immediate divorce.”

## 23 FEB

### Alliance Protests Triggered by Cancelled Election

The postponement of the election for a new prime minister has led to widespread public disorder across Alliance systems.

The Alliance Assembly vote was scheduled for Thursday the 25th of February. This date clashed with the start of the Galactic Summit, causing incumbent Prime Minister Edmund Mahon to propose that the election be delayed for three months.

On many Alliance worlds, large-scale protest marches have placed pressure on local police forces. Some civil leaders have condemned Mahon for using the diplomatic conference as an excuse to extend his term of office.

Mahon has referred to the unrest as being caused by a “vocal minority of agitators”, and insisted that the delay is in the Alliance’s best interests.

Councillor Nakato Kaine, Mahon’s main rival, has given the protests her full support. She has become a figurehead for public dissent, with some political pundits suggesting that she might have won the election had it been held this week.

Speaking to The Alliance Tribune, Councillor Kaine said:

“This is the latest in a string of short-sighted decisions, and it’s clear that the people no longer trust their prime minister. For this reason, despite believing the Galactic Summit to be a waste of time, I will be attending the conference to ensure that Mahon’s agenda does not dominate proceedings.”

## 25 FEB

### Rare Goods Received for Political Delegates

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

A wide range of luxurious food and drink for the Galactic Summit has been delivered to the Sirius Corporation.

Orders were placed for Eden Apples Of Aerial, Ethgreze Tea Buds, Gerasian Gueuze Beer, Giant Irukama Snails, Goman Yaupon Coffee, Karsuki Locusts and Lavian Brandy. Large quantities of these rare items were shipped to Ashby City in the Luyten’s Star system.

The consumables will be ferried to the nearby Sirius system, where the diplomatic conference will take place. This initiative was considered a priority, since some delegates only agreed to attend if their requests for these rarities were met.

CEO Li Yong-Rui has expressed his personal thanks to all pilots who delivered the rare goods, who can now collect their payment at Ashby City in the Luyten’s Star system.

Sirius Corporation has been organising the Galactic Summit for the past month, which has involved increased freight runs into its home system as well as heightened security. Preparations are now complete, and the first ambassadors from the Alliance, Empire and Federation are on their way.

### Galactic Summit Begins with Defence Request

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The Federation is working with Sirius Corporation to offer bounty hunting opportunities to protect the diplomatic conference.

The first Galactic Summit has officially opened at Patterson Enterprise station in the Sirius system. Temporary permits have been issued to all arriving delegates and Commanders for the three weeks of its term, although these do not apply to fleet carriers.

Sirius Corporation’s CEO Li Yong-Rui announced:

“The data supplied to us in January revealed several unanticipated threats, putting additional strain on our navy and security forces. Working with the generous support of the Federation, we have placed bounties on all wanted ships to ensure delegates’ safety. Pilots defending the Sirius system will be rewarded for handing in bounty vouchers at the Spirit of Laelaps.”

The joint initiative will run for one week, after which Sirius Corporation will partner with the Empire to provide for the needs and security of the conference.

In related news, Core Dynamics, Gutamaya and Lakon Spaceways are celebrating the political gathering of all three superpowers with a 10% discount on their ships during the next three weeks.

Delegations have begun to arrive and formal introductions are taking place, with much media attention. This is the first time that universally recognised figures such as President Zachary Hudson, Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Princess Aisling Duval have been seen side by side.

## 26 FEB

### Historic Meetings at the Galactic Summit

Alliance, Empire and Federation leaders have held their first ever face-to-face discussions at the diplomatic conference in the Sirius system.

Political correspondent Conrad Sterling published this report for Vox Galactica:

“The Galactic Summit has already made history by bringing together many political figureheads within one conference chamber. Optimistic opening statements from Chancellor Anders Blaine and Prime Minister Edmund Mahon gained applause. President Zachary Hudson was more curt, reminding everyone that billions of people would be affected by their efforts.”

“Agendas and debate topics for the next three weeks were formalised. Much of the work will be done behind the scenes by ambassadorial staff, making big decisions in small rooms.”

“The general tone so far has been courteous, although that may not last. Predictably, interactions between the Imperial and Marlinist delegations have been frosty, with Senator Denton Patreus refusing to even acknowledge their presence during discussions.”

“However, First Minister Jenna Fairfax enjoyed a more cordial meeting with Shadow President Felicia Winters. They were joined by Jasmina Halsey, who has accompanied Winters from Mars in an unofficial capacity.”

“One notable absentee was Federal Ambassador Jordan Rochester, whose family is under legal scrutiny following the crimes of his older brother Jupiter Rochester. This at least spared Jordan the awkwardness of having to formally greet his ex-fiancée, Princess Aisling Duval. But it’s likely there will be no shortage of tension between other delegates in the coming weeks.”
