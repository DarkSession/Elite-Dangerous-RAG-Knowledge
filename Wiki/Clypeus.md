Clypeus Margaritus - Mauve
 		 	 

> 
> 
> Extremophile organisms that have evolved to create hard shield structures, primarily to protect against stellar radiation.  They also collect and condense traces of liquid material in the atmosphere, allowing the organisms to flourish in extremely arid environments.  The shields are typically synthesized from surrounding inorganic material, which will frequently define their shape and colouration.

### Description

*A species of clypeus that grows a broad, tear-shaped shield to protect the sensitive organism from extreme sunlight. The shield’s ridges help to direct Water droplets down into the soil.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planets with thin Carbon Dioxide or Water atmosphere
- Maximum gravity : 0.27
- Mean temperature superior to 190 K

### Description

*This clypeus species produces a curved shield that resembles a large pearl in shape and texture. Up to three central organisms grow within it upon a supporting bed of leaves.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planets with thin Carbon Dioxide or Water atmosphere
- Maximum gravity : 0.27
- Mean temperature superior to 190 K
