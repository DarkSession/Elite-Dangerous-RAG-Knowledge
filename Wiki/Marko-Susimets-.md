Tales from the Frontier - A story in the new anthology based on the upcoming Elite: Dangerous by Frontier Developments

Marcan Rayger - Set of stories in the Frontier universe

## Elite Bio

Marko Susimetsä first played Elite on Commodore 64 in 1985 and immediately fell in love with it. He was 12 at the time and the game is one that he says "defined" him as a gamer, alongside the Ultima IV and Civilization games. He later played the game on Amiga 500 and 1200, on which he also played Frontier: Elite 2. It was only when he bought a PC in around 1996 that he started playing Frontier First Encounters.

## Fiction Contributions to Elite

Marko wrote his Marcan Rayger stories in 1999 and 2000. It was released as-is as it was written and is basically "first draft" quality. He is currently in the process of writing a short story for the Tales from the Frontier anthology that will be released with the release of Elite: Dangerous.

**Reception of Marcan Rayger**
Davidtq at Frontier forums commented:

*I really enjoyed the "realism" of the various characters' motivations. Rather than just being an action story there was a good believable character, a person with reasons for what he was doing and not just generic action hero. The motivations and emotions were very thoroughly explored.*

*The fleshing out of the Frontier universe was very nice, putting a face and a style to both the federal military and the empire was great, far more interesting than the simple bbs in the game, giving a feel of real people instead of "standard unit" soldiers.*

*Overall though the story for me was to Frontier what the Dark Wheel was to Elite, but had the advantage of being substantially longer (definitely a good thing).*
