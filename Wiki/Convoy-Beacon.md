A **Convoy Beacon** is a rare type of Signal Source.

## Signal Contents

Convoy Beacons can contain a single Type-9 Heavy being escorted by two Anacondas. All three ships are initially neutral. While the ships themselves are relatively mundane, scanning them rewards a variety of Encoded Materials, occasionally including hard-to-find data such as Abnormal Compact Emissions Data and Classified Scan Fragments.

Convoy Beacons can also have a large group of miscellaneous trade ships without escort.

## Spawn Locations

Convoy Beacons occasionally appear in systems that are experiencing an Outbreak. A persistent Convoy Beacon can always be found in the permit-locked Isinor system, in orbit of the planet Maodun; the system permit can be acquired by becoming allied with the Chapter of Isinor minor faction.
