The **Guardian Hull Reinforcement Package** (sometimes abbreviated to GHRP) is a module derived from Guardian technology. When powered, it increases a ship's hull integrity by a flat value, and also boosts resistance to Thermal and Caustic damage. In order to purchase the Guardian Hull Reinforcement Package, it must first be unlocked through a Technology Broker.

## Unlocking

The Guardian Hull Reinforcement Package can be permanently unlocked for purchase by providing the following Materials to a Guardian Technology Broker:

- 1 Guardian Module Blueprint Fragment
- 21 Guardian Sentinel Wreckage Components
- 16 Pattern Beta Obelisk Data
- 16 Pattern Gamma Obelisk Data
- 12 Reinforced Mounting Plate

## Usage

All Thargoid attacks deal the near-unique Caustic damage *type*, which can only be resisted with the Guardian Hull Reinforcement Package or the Meta Alloy Hull Reinforcement Package. This includes damage from projectiles, caustic clouds, caustic missiles, and 50% of Thargon missile damage.

**Comparison to Grade 5 Heavy Duty Hull Reinforcements**

Guardian Hull Reinforcements(or GHRPs) are specifically useful for AX combat, as they sacrifice armor and resistances to human damage types for their unique caustic resistance. 

It's important to note that GHRPs do *not* offer more overall armor value. Instead, they *reduce damage taken*, which carries with it a number of sub-benefits, including making repairs faster and cheaper - since less damage is taken, less must be repaired - and, an equal increase in module integrity - resistances *do* apply fully to modules as well as armor. This makes their use somewhat more complex than simply using engineered human hull reinforcements. That *is* the simplest and easiest approach - admittedly with the cost of significantly higher engineering costs. 

### Pros

- **Cheap:** Can be bought and sold for credits from any Guardian Tech Broker station, without needing to be engineered.
- **Sustainable:** Reduces damage taken, making repairs faster and easier. As a general rule, offer more overall integrity after four Class 5 repair limpets.
- **Module Integrity:** Resistances do apply to module integrity, including the vital Canopy.

### Cons

- **Power Draw:** GHRPs take a notable amount of power.
- **Lower flat armor integrity:** Before repairs and module protection are accounted for, GHRPs do have notably less integrity, especially before accounting for resistances.

Overall, the use of GHRPs depends on player preference and use case. Players who often find themselves destroyed outright will likely benefit more from human hull reinforcements, while players who instead tend to find themselves waiting on repairs or having their canopy blown will instead benefit the most from GHRPs.

## Notes

- While Guardian Hull Reinforcement Packages require power to operate, they remain functional even if the ship's Power Plant is damaged. They also cannot be disabled.
