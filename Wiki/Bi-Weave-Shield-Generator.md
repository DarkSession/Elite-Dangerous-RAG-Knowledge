The **Bi-Weave Shield Generator** (BWSG) is an alternative shield generator that sacrifices shield strength for a faster recharge rate. Added in 1.5/2.0, the strength of this type of shields is equal to that of a D-rated shield generator of the same class. However, it recharges between 1.8 and 2.46 times as fast as a normal shield does, although the power draw from the SYS capacitor is proportional to repaired shield points.

## Notes

- Since shield boosters do not affect the recharge rate, they can be used to make up for the difference in overall shield strength, provided that the ship has enough power/utility mounts.
- Bi-weave shields show pink colour when hit, which allows for an easy shield type identification, much like PSGs.
