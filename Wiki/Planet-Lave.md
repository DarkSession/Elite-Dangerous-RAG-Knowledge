**Planet Lave**, located in the Lave system, is the former capital planet and seat of the Galactic Cooperative. It still has many tributes such as museums and artifacts of the GalCop era which make it a popular tourist destination.^[1]^

Planet Lave is 114.54 light years from Sol. It has a human-breathable atmosphere. Much of its vast rain forests were cut down by irresponsible locals to raise cattle, and the famous tree grub is extinct.^[2]^

Lave had a dictatorship from before the fall of GalCop. Dr. Hans Walden came to power in 3174.^[3]^

## Notes

- Lave is one of three suggested starting points in Frontier: Elite II beside Mars in Sol and Merlin in Ross 154. But primarily it is the starting point in the original Elite making it the first thing players see in the Elite franchise.
