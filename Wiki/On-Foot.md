## Overview

On Foot activities allow players to interact with the galaxy in first person. Odyssey added 2 Pilots Federation ranks: Mercenary and Exobiologist. All players can disembark from their ship inside a hangar or on a planetary surface. The accessible terrestrials are limited to planets and moons with zero or tenuous atmospheres. Undertaking On Foot activities requires managing equipment such as handheld weapons, tools, consumables and suits. Components, Goods, and Data can be used to upgrade weapons and suits.

### Activities

There are many kinds of on foot activities such as PVE and PVP in a conflict zone on a planet's surface. Exploration and xenobiology on planets. Such as at a Thargoid barnacle, surface site or Spire. This can be done solo or with a team. Deathmatch between commanders. Settlements have mechanics such as security controls, power, defenses. Stealth objectives can be reactivation or sabotage. Heist and theft missions to covertly steal objects. Some Assassination missions require engineered suit and weapons to do it properly. There's Courier and Smuggling. Ship-to-ground and vs SRV combat. The 2 main career categories are Mercenary and Exobiology. If you are the first person to land on an unexplored planetary body and disembark from your ship then you will receive credit from Universal Cartographics and an exploration bonus for making First Footfall. 

### Missions

On Foot missions can be shared with all players who are in a Team by selecting the "Share" button on any mission transaction panel. Team members can individually accept or decline a shared mission invitation. Sharing a mission limits the rewards for participants to credits, reputation, or items, while the mission host retains the option to select an influence reward. If a mission involves obtaining a specific item, that mission item will be automatically moved the mission host's inventory when boarding a ship or departing the mission area. If a team member is critically injured and is holding a mission item, they will drop that item, allowing other team members to collect it and continue the mission.^[1]^

Missions have a timer that runs in real time. This could be a few days and you get a bonus if you complete the mission sooner. While on a mission you can go on a detour such as during a salvage mission you could land on another planet to collect samples from Fonticulua with the Genetic Sampler or inspect a minor wreckage.

Massacre missions are recommended to learn the settlement layouts, gather materials, and progress the mercenary rank. The gained experience makes stealth missions easier. Ships may chase you after completing such missions.

Heist and theft missions requires stealing an object from a settlement. If it's covert then you cannot trigger alarms, and you can't kill anyone in the process. Opening a containment unit to get the target object always triggers the alarm. So you have to find the alarm control panel and disable the alarm systems first. It's quite profitable, roughly equal to scavenging.

### Roleplay

On foot roleplaying is more immersive because you are a character rather than the ship. The commander's physical appearance, suit and accessories are customizable via Holo-Me. Emotes in the HUD are used to physically communicate with others and the ship.

## Mercenary

 	 	[![ED Odyssey Mercenary On Foot](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/f/f6/ED_Odyssey_Mercenary_On_Foot.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220811011329)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/f/f6/ED_Odyssey_Mercenary_On_Foot.png/revision/latest?cb=20220811011329) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Mercenary
 		 	 

    - *Main article: Mercenary*

Mercenary work focuses on practically all instances of On Foot combat. This can range from accepting missions involving objectives at settlements, which can involve both legal and illegal actions, to signing up with Frontline Solutions as a hired gun for a warring minor faction, to investigating remote points of interest and scavenging valuables from wrecks or smuggling caches. As the player kills more personnel and completes more missions, they advance their Mercenary rank.

## Exobiology

 	 	[![Tussock Ignis](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/bd/Tussock_Ignis.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20210527012541)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/bd/Tussock_Ignis.png/revision/latest?cb=20210527012541) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Exobiology
 		 	 

    - *Main article: Exobiologist*

Exobiology focuses on identifying and cataloguing species of flora and fauna on planetary surfaces with the Genetic Sampler. By assembling a complete organic sample from partial samples of 1 species, the complete sample can be redeemed at Vista Genomics for credits. The first player to log a particular species in a galactic region will receive a discovery credit in the Codex. As the player documents more alien flora, they advance their Exobiologist rank.  

## Equipment

 	 	[![Remlok-items-weapons-suit](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/f/fa/Remlok-items-weapons-suit.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220812105043)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/f/fa/Remlok-items-weapons-suit.png/revision/latest?cb=20220812105043)

To carry out On Foot activities, players have access to a selection of weapons, devices, and other personal gear. While On Foot, players also use a specialised HUD and the multifunctional InSight Hub personal info interface, which can be used to check the player's inventory, summon an Apex Interstellar Transport shuttle, activate Emotes, and more. Handheld Weapons and suits can be upgraded using Components, Goods, and Data, and they can also be Engineered.

Pre-upgraded and pre-engineered weapons and suits can be found at Pioneer Supplies.^[2]^ They are 1-time purchase which means when someone buys it, that particular item is gone from the store (unlike the standard items which have unlimited stock).^[2]^ The unique items are refreshed every Thursday. You could search for unique gear at small backwater stations.^[2]^

### Handheld weapons

## NPC Personnel

There are different types of NPC personnel that can be encountered at settlements or points of interest. Their role determines which weapons and tools they are carrying, and what level of security authorisation they have at the settlement.

| Role | Equipment | Settlement<br>Authorisation Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Administrator | Karma P-15 or TK Zenith | 3 |
| Commando | Karma AR-50 or TK Aphelion |  |
| Enforcer | Karma L-6 |  |
| Pilot |  |  |
| Scientist | Karma P-15 or TK Zenith |  |
| Scout | Karma C-44 or TK Eclipse |  |
| Sharpshooter | Manticore Executioner |  |
| Striker | Manticore Intimidator |  |
| Worker | Karma P-15 or TK Zenith |  |

Most NPC personnel belong to a particular faction, though some may be representatives of Omnipol, a special interstellar law enforcement agency that is independent of the Galactic Superpowers. Omnipol personnel wear distinct white-and-blue outfits with 'OMNIPOL' emblazoned across the chestpiece, as opposed to whichever faction livery they would normally sport.

## Storage

Consumables and materials are stored in the vehicle that you use. Commodities are stored in the cargo hold of your ship. There's a limit to how much you can hold on your person. The rest gets stored on your ship and/or SRV. You can go to either to restock.^[3]^

Unlike commodities, you won't lose consumables if you die. However, if you get arrested then you'll lose the consumables and any E-breaches on your person. Restocking does not automatically restock your E-breaches, since it's illegal to carry them around. You'll get attacked if you're scanned and possess them. Pirates also scan your ship for cargo.^[3]^

## Concourse

 	 	[![Concourse Tourist](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/17/Concourse_Tourist.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20210901015733)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/17/Concourse_Tourist.png/revision/latest?cb=20210901015733) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Concourse for tourists
 		 	 

    - *Main article: Concourse*

The Concourse is a public area in Stations, Surface Ports, certain Megaships and Fleet Carriers. You can disembark from your ship after docking and take an express lift directly to the Concourse. The Concourse is the only way to access certain services that are exclusive to On Foot activities:

- Apex Interstellar Transport - Local and interstellar shuttle service.
- Frontline Solutions - Sign up for local Conflict Zones.
- Inter Astra - a shipyard service
- Pioneer Supplies - Buy, sell, and upgrade pilot equipment.
- Vista Genomics - Redeem organic samples obtained with the Genetic Sampler.

## Points of Interest

    - *Main article: Points of Interest*

A new series of Points of Interest designed around On Foot and SRV activities present additional opportunities for combat and scavenging.

- Active Power Source
- Artificial Structure
- Conflict Zone
- Crash Site
- Distress Beacon
- Impact Site
- Irregular Markers
- Minor Wreckage
- Surface Excavation

## Restrictions

### Disembark

Disembarking from a ship for On Foot activities is only possible on planets that fall within certain parameters. Ships cannot land on planets that have an atmosphere denser than 0.1 atm, and players cannot disembark onto planetary surfaces if the planet's gravity is 2.7 G or greater, or if the player's ship has a broken canopy.

A planet that has a surface temperature greater than 800 K where it is lit by a star is hazardous to pilots, but it is still permitted to disembark on the planet's light side if desired. Be aware that pilots will suffer damage continuously while On Foot in hazardous temperatures until they board their ship, enter an SRV, or walk to the cooler dark side of the planet if the threshold is close enough to do so.

### Camera view

On foot is designed exclusively for first person view. However, it is possible to view your character in third person by using the free camera mode of the camera suite. This enables viewing of your character in 3rd person, but there is no HUD display.

## Development

The first Elite 4 concept art in issue 95 of Edge magazine (March, 2001) included an early stage model of a female character with a weapon.^[4]^

Since the 2012 Kickstarter campaign there has been concept art of extravehicular activities. This ranges from people walking in a station to first person combat and ship repairs. There is a 3D blockout of a station with a 3D character holding a weapon. Docked ships are loaded with cargo and flying drones carry cargo containers.

### Roadmap

 	 	[![Anaconda-Walking-Pilot-Scale](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/b9/Anaconda-Walking-Pilot-Scale.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20170714171248)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/b9/Anaconda-Walking-Pilot-Scale.png/revision/latest?cb=20170714171248)

Frontier has a roadmap with small, free updates in addition to expansions with significant new features and content which they intend to release. It mentions EVA in no particular order:^[8]^ 

- Walking around interiors and combative boarding of other ships
- Combat and other interactions with other players and AIs in the internal areas of star ports

Newsletter #32 confirms the following: *"We plan to continue to significantly enhance the game via further expansions after the launch date, using the same incremental development philosophy that we’ve used so far. Major new features will include planetary landings and even walking around inside ships, stations, and planet surfaces with time."^[9]^*

*"We also plan to allow you to get up out of your seat and walk around your ship. You can see the level of attention and thought that has already been given to the ship interiors."*^[9]^

*"Of course walking round your ship will be nice, but it is the just springboard for a very significant expansion of gameplay – you will be able to experience the inside of starports and interact with other players and AI characters, and even board other people’s ships in space and take them by force, as shown in this concept piece. Of course this will be further expanded to include walking around on the surfaces of planets too."*^[9]^

An interview on 13 June 2014: *"Pryrios: When you say we will walk inside ships and stations, are you thinking in first person view or third person view over the shoulder? If it's third person view, are you planning on doing some character creator to make different characters for players?"*^[10]^

*"David Braben: First person."*^[10]^

Development plan on the Kickstarter page (December 2014): *"You will be able to walk around the spaceport, you will be able to see gold being loaded into someone else's ship, you will be able to sneak in and hide in amongst the cargo. All of those things are phenomenal game play opportunities where that ship might actually be the ship of another player, so just think where that all ends."*^[7]^

On 12 March 2015, David Braben said, *"...as you can walk around inside your ships, things like leather upholstery are also things that we can do. It’s not a pay-to-win thing but actually makes your ship more shiny."*^[11]^

On 20 March 2015, Braben was asked about the long roadmap ahead and his reply was (at 5:20), *"Well I'm very excited. I've said over a long time I'm very excited about some features that we will do down the road including things like landing on planets, walking around inside your spaceship, getting out of your spaceship, all of those things I think are very very exciting and obviously those are in the long-term roadmap."*^[12]^

On 26 May 2016 during an AMA with David Braben, this question was asked: *"Is there a small team doing any preliminary work on atmosphere landings / walking (in stations etc) currently being looked at? As it is almost there for walking in station..."* Braben replied, *"Yes. We have ongoing work on planets, including atmospheres, planetary life, walking about and lots of other very exciting things for the future."*^[13]^

On 8 April 2016, Braben reiterated that walking around will be a future update: *“There was a lot of discussion prior to and during the Kickstarter project as to whether you should be able to walk around in your ship. We looked at that in great detail. Ultimately we decided the arbiter has to be, ‘Does it make the game more fun?’ Because it’s a lot of extra work and it brings in more constraints. It’s something we will do, but it’ll be in a future update because we need so many things on a human scale for that to be additive and enjoyable.”*^[14]^

On Foot blockout concept
 		 	 

On 10 March 2017 during a Q&A at PAX East, lead designer Sandro Sammarco said "Space Legs" were way off in the future: *"How will Telepresence and Multicrew work in the future with Space Legs and EVA gameplay? 'Just to set the record straight, Space Legs and EVA gameplay, that's way off in the future. That's a goal. I've talked to David and it's always been part of his core vision for what Elite really is, even from way back in the day, it's always been about you're a person in a real futuristic setting, not just a ship. However, I think it's also fair to say Space Legs is effectively dovetailing a whole new game into Elite. We take steps towards it, it's our end vision, but we're not there yet, we're... it's a long way off. And when it does, by the time, if we get there, if we manage it, I'm sure we'll have the time to sort out any consistencies that need to be sorted out."*^[6]^

On 11 April 2017 during the The Commanders Release Livestream (at 10:10), Braben confirmed that space legs is coming and is planned, but it's not imminent. A person in the chat asked, *"Will we get space legs at some point? If yes don't say when, but answer with long, medium or short."* Braben replied, *"It's coming, but obviously it's not imminent, but it is coming and it is planned."*^[15]^

On 11 April 2017, Braben's closing statement of a Reddit AMA: *"The future for Elite Dangerous is very exciting, including a whole raft of incredible features, yes including 'space legs' but so many more things too. We have such a great community, and we're really glad that you guys share our passion and support us."*^[16]^^[17]^

On 4 October 2017 Zac Antonaci wrote, *"Spacelegs (as the community are dubbing them) is something that David B and the development team are very excited by and it’s certainly high on the list of features they would like to make. However, as we’ve mentioned before, 'Spacelegs' is something further down the line. After 2.4 we’ll be focusing on the core gameplay experience so it’s not something that we will be announcing at Frontier Expo. I do have to say though, I truly hope that the community are excited by the content being revealed at FX."*^[18]^

On 27 January 2018, Sandro Sammarco said, *"The team and I all see Space Legs as the feature we will love to add and are at the top of our specification, but it's something that will not happen in the Beyond season. We will talk more about it later."*^[19]^^[20]^

On 31 August 2018, Zac Antonaci posted an important community update on Frontier Forums with relevant information: "*A while ago, our development went from pre-production into full production on our next major milestone of Elite development. What that means in the simplest terms is that the team are actively working on the next major landmark which takes us into our next era for Elite. We aren’t going to be ready to talk about or announce any details for quite a while yet, it is early in the development and there is still a long way to go, but I can say that this is something that will be scheduled to release a considerable time after the final update in the Beyond series. We will have more details on exactly what this means and how the era will roll out after the release of Beyond – Chapter Four, but **this does mark some exciting next steps** and a continued commitment to the long term vision for the game and our community.*"^[21]^

When Wolvie said, *"Thanks for the update Zac, it's good to hear some honest comments as things have been quiet for several months on the Focused Feedback. I'm a Beta Backer with Lifetime Expansion Pass and have always seen Elites development as a journey not a race, I'm looking forward to what comes next."*^[22]^

Antonaci responded, *"Thanks Wolvie, I hope you enjoy the next leg of the journey."*^[23]^

### Commander Chronicles: Lift-Off

On 26 June 2018, Frontier released the cinematic video Commander Chronicles: Lift-Off. This was the first demonstration of pilot walking animations using the *Elite Dangerous* engine. A Commander is shown walking across a station Landing Pad, then using a lift to enter a Krait MkII. He enters the cockpit, where two other Commanders are waiting, sits in the primary pilot seat, and then controls the ship as it lifts off, departs the station, and jumps into hyperspace.^[24]^

### Mission Pack leak

In October 2018, a few mission pack videos with standing and talking NPCs were discovered in the public test server movies folder.^[25]^

There is one video with sound, which has an apparent mission-giver swaying back and forth, offering you an assignment you may be interested in, saying you should make your way to their command ship. There are also several silent videos of the same mission-giver seated talking to a camera briefly.^[25]^

### Odyssey reveal

On 3 June 2020, Frontier Developments announced the game's second expansion, *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*, would release in Q1 2021. Among other key features, *Odyssey* included On Foot functionality, at the time referred to by the community and unofficially by the developers as "Space Legs". The name was coined over the years for the highly-anticipated feature. The pre-alpha trailer of *Odyssey* showed three Commanders in armoured space suits with weapons walking on foot across an arid terrestrial world with a presumably non-breathable atmosphere. The Commanders arrive at a small surface structure while an Anaconda touches down at an adjacent landing zone.^[26]^ *Odyssey* was released on PC on 19 May 2021.^[27]^
