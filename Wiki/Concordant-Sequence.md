# Concordant Sequence
**Concordant Sequence** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to a weapon through Engineering. It causes weapon strikes to temporarily enhance the regeneration rate of a wingman's shield(+1000%), at the cost of increased heat generation(+20%).

This effect is applied instantly, and lasts for about 5 seconds. Regeneration is still limited by normal restrictions, so shields cannot regenerate within 3 seconds of taking damage, and the effect can only be applied to an active shield, so it cannot accelerate broken regeneration. Furthermore, it is a multiplier of the base regeneration rate, so biweaves benefit much more than prismatic shields.

## Applicability

This effect is available for the following weapons:

- Beam Laser
- Burst Laser
- Pulse Laser

## Materials Required

- 5x Focus Crystals
- 3x Modified Embedded Firmware
- 1x Zirconium
