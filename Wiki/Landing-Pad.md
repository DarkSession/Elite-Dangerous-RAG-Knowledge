# Landing Pad

A **Landing Pad** is a facility or marked area where ships can dock. Upon landing at a Landing Pad, a ship's landing gear is locked in place and the pilot can access the local port's services interface. Accessing the Commodities Market, Mission Board, Passenger Lounge, Universal Cartographics, Contacts, GalNet, Refueling, Restock, and Maintenance is possible immediately after landing, but Livery, Outfitting, and the Shipyard require fully entering the Landing Pad's sealed internal hangar. Landing Pads at Settlements do not possess internal hangars and offer only a limited selection of services compared to larger port facilities.

## Landing Pad Sizes and Ships

There are three sizes of Landing Pad which can accommodate the three general ship sizes: Small, Medium, and Large. All Starports, Asteroid Bases, Surface Ports, and Megaships have all Landing Pad sizes available. Outposts have only Small and Medium pads. Settlements have varying Landing Pad layouts depending on their type. Rarely, Small or Medium ships may be permitted to dock at larger pads if no size-appropriate pad is open.
