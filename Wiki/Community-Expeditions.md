# Community Expeditions
Community expeditions are player-run exploration events where a group of explorers head out of the Bubble to explore together.

## About

The concept of community Expeditions outside of inhabited space began in 3301, but they only became prevalent in 3302 when they exploded in popularity after the success of the first major expedition, Distant Worlds.

Following Distant Worlds, over 20 expeditions were organized in 3302. All of various shapes and sizes to explore different part of our galaxy, all for different reasons.

The pace wasn't slowed in 3303 which hosted a greater number of expeditions.

Community Expeditions are usually open for the public to join by some means, either through the official forums, language specific forums, or Discord. Below is a list of all Expeditions, past, present and future.
