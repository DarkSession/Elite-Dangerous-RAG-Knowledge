Class 2 Mining Laser
 		 	 

> 
> 
> The mining laser cuts chunks of asteroid off at a rate determined by the amount of mining laser power applied to the asteroid. Thus, more mining lasers will result in more chunks in the same period of time. Once cut off the chunks can be retrieved by cargo scoop or limpet drone. A refinery module is required to process asteroid chunks into saleable commodities.

The **Mining Laser** is a basic mining tool that uses lasers to cut mineral and metal fragments off of the surface of asteroids. These fragments can be collected via the cargo scoop or drones. A Refinery is required to process the fragments and cargo space is required to store the material in Commodity form. 

Despite being able to cut into asteroids, Mining Lasers are very ineffective in combat, suffering from a short maximum range, low damage output, and low armour penetration. Mining Lasers are also limited to scraping resource fragments from the surface of asteroids, and other mining tools must be equipped in order to access surface, sub-surface, and deep core deposits.

## Modified Mining Laser

A pre-Engineered Class 1 Mining Laser with Long Range, reduced Distributor Draw, and Incendiary Rounds Experimental Effect named "Modified Mining Laser" can be purchased from the Human Technology Brokers at Zetian's Recall in LTT 198.   Note that LTT 198 is permit locked by Torval Mining Ltd.  It may be advisable to obtain this permit before collecting the required materials, in particular the Osmium, rather than dragging them around and risking them while running missions for Torval Mining.

Unlike unlocking most other Technology Broker items, which makes them permanently available for purchase with credits at station outfitting services, unlocking a Modified Mining Laser immediately places one module in local storage at no additional cost. The module must also be unlocked repeatedly in order to obtain multiple copies. Note that although the included modifications can be removed, Engineers cannot re-apply them or apply any other modifications to these modules.

Unlocking requires the following Materials and Commodities:

- 20 Arsenic
- 24 Rhenium
- 28 Phosphorus
- 16 Osmium

###### Specifications (compared to a regular 1D Mining Laser):

| Integrity | Damage per second | Power Draw | Distributor Draw | Thermal Load | Maximum Range | Falloff |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 20 *(-50%)* | 1.9 *(-5%)* | 0.25 *(-50%)* | 0.75 *(-50%)* | 1.0 *(-49%)* | 2,500 *(+400%)* | 2,500 *(+733%)* |

## Notes

- Turreted Mining Lasers were added in the *Elite Dangerous: Horizons - The Commanders* (2.3) update.^[1]^ These turreted Mining Lasers only function as full turrets when under the control of a Multicrew Gunner.
