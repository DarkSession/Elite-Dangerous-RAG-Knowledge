**Q-Type Anomalies** are a a form of Notable Stellar Phenomena. They react strongly to ships that approach them too closely, and will emit one of a variety of different energy pulses depending on type.

## Finding

Go to a "notable stellar phenomena" and drop out of supercruise. The Q-Type anomaly is usually at the edge of a metallic crystal field. You must fly around the outside of the field to find them. Flash lights, drop a heat sink, and then composition scan while it's agitated.

## Types

There are six known types of Q-Type Anomalies:

- Q02-Type Anomaly - Emits a high-heat pulse if approached within 200m.
- Q04-Type Anomaly - Causes a shield-breaching attack if approached within 200m. The pulse will not inflict module or shield damage but will inflict immediate hull damage. Approaching with the Shield Generator powered down will not cause any damage up to a distance of 75m, at which the hull damage will resume regardless of shield state, and the cockpit UI will be scrambled similar to a Thargoid shutdown pulse.
- Q06-Type Anomaly
- Q07-Type Anomaly
- Q08-Type Anomaly - Emits a shield-damaging pulse if approached within 200m. The pulse will only inflict hull damage if the ship is closer than 55m to the Anomaly. Prolonged proximity to the Anomaly will cause a gas cloud to expand and the hull damage radius will increase up to 75m and the shield damage radius will increase up to 290m, both directly proportional to the cloud's radius.
- Q09-Type Anomaly - Emits a shield-damaging pulse if approached within 170m. The pulse will inflict hull damage only if the ship has its shields offline.
