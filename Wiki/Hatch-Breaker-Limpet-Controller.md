## Usage

Hatch Breaker Limpets travel at 300 m/s and ignore shields. They can only be stopped by an Electronic Countermeasure.^[1]^ To use, make sure that the module is equipped and bound to a fire group. Select a target, move into range as defined by the module's class and rating, and then launch the Hatch Breaker. If successful, it will attach itself to the targeted ship, hack the Cargo Hatch over a period of time, and then cause commodities to spill out of the ship's hold. This function makes Hatch Breaker Limpet Controller an invaluable tool for Pirates who are unable to coerce their prey with simple intimidation.

Hatch Breaker Limpets can also be used on Bulk Cruiser Megaship Cargo Bays and Escape Hatches. The latter usages expands the Hatch Breaker Limpet Controller's suitable roles to include Salvage and Search and Rescue.
