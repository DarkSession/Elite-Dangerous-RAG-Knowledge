**Robotics** is a specific commodity item of technology in the galaxy.

Robotics pertains to the creation and building of robots and computer programming. It's interdisciplinary with engineering and science. Robots are built to do things so humans don't need to or can't do. Such as tasks that are too hot, cold, dangerous or distant for humans.

Androids are a more advanced type of humanoid robots with artificial intelligence that imitates humans. However, sentient machines are banned in Federal, Imperial and Alliance space.
