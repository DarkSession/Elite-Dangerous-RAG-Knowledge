**Gourd Molluscs** are non-sapient, spacefaring creatures that inhabit Notable Stellar Phenomena and loosely resemble the molluscs native to Earth. They appear to communicate with each other using whale-like vocalizations. They also exhibit an interest in ships and will follow them for several kilometers provided they can keep pace, but will shy away if a ship approaches them closer than approximately 40 meters or they enter the vicinity of other objects such as Metallic Crystals. When near a stationary ship, Gourd Molluscs will repeatedly propel themselves toward the ship and then away from it.^[1]^

As of 2025-05-06, research limpets can not be used to gather materials from Albulum Gourd Mollusc because the limpet drone will die by colliding with the mollusc.
