Metal asteroids and a Viper MkIII
 		 	 

**Asteroids** are the leftover material from the formation of a star system. They are too small to form a planet of their own and did not collide with another planet. They can consist of carbon (Type C), metal (Type M) and stone (Type S). Many planets have ring systems composed of asteroids, shattered comets, moons, and other debris. Some systems have asteroid belts, thinly distributed clusters of asteroids that orbit a star rather than a planetary body.^[1]^

Many asteroids are treasure troves of valuable resources. A miner can extract minerals and metals from asteroids using specialized mining tools, such as a Mining Laser. Larger mining operations use Asteroid Miner Megaships, and some asteroids have even been hollowed out to create Asteroid Bases.
