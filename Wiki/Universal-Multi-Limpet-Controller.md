The **Universal Multi Limpet Controller** is a Limpet Controller that can program limpets with the Collector, Decontamination, Fuel Transfer, Hatch Breaker, Prospector, Recon, Repair, or Research functions as needed. Although it is more flexible than the specialised modules it combines, it is only available in a large size, is less efficient, and has significantly greater mass.

## Usage

The Universal Multi Limpet Controller combines the functions of all eight standard Limpet Controllers into a single module. The convenience of this is offset by the module's large size, which restricts it to the Anaconda, Federal Corvette, Imperial Clipper, Imperial Cutter, Type-8 Transporter, Type-9 Heavy and Type-10 Defender, and its enormous mass, either 125 or 140 tonnes depending on rating.
