## Usage

The Frame Shift Wake Scanner can be deployed in both normal space and while traveling in Supercruise. To use, make sure that the Frame Shift Wake Scanner is equipped and bound to a fire group (can be done in the ship's right control menu). Maneuver within range of a Frame Shift Drive Wake and press the fire button until the scan has completed. A successful scan will reveal both the name of the commander who created the wake and the destination of their jump.

The following Materials can be randomly obtained by scanning High Energy Wakes:

- Atypical Disrupted Wake Echoes
- Anomalous FSD Telemetry
- Strange Wake Solutions
- Eccentric Hyperspace Trajectories
- Datamined Wake Exceptions
