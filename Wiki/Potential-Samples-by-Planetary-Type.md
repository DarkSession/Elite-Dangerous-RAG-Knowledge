# Potential Samples by Planetary Type
The following is a list of species that may be found by planetary type. Some species have additional requirements that are not listed below. When targeting a particular species please visit that page directly for more information. Elite Observatory with the Bioinsights plug-in is a great resource to have for prolonged exploration expeditions. Colony Range (CCR) refers to the minimum distance between specimens needed for a sample to be taken.

## Rocky Body

The rocky body is your bread and butter for specimen collection. While not as common as icy bodies, they house the most potential for species diversity and value. They are found in many star types, but main sequence starts tend to house more of them.

## Icy Body

The icy body is the most common body encountered while exploring. Due to their low temperature they tend to house few biological signals. However, don't discount their value too quickly. There are diamonds amongst the ice and a quick 40 million credits could be just 3 samples away.
