**Bronzite Chondrites** are a source of raw materials found on the surface of planets and moons. They can be detected with an SRV's Wave Scanner. 

Bronzite Chondrite is represented on the Wave Scanner as two close bars, near the bottom. They mostly drop Grade 1 and 2 materials, and rarely Grade 3 or 4.

When they are destroyed by weapons fire from a ship or SRV they explode into chunks of materials, which can be collected using a ship or SRV's Cargo Scoop. Each chunk of a material yields three units of that specific material.
