### What is Elite Dangerous?

***Elite Dangerous*** is a massively multiplayer space epic and flight simulation game. It is the fourth in the legendary and Guinness world record making Elite series. It includes mass-multiplayer with a shared narrative and a 1:1 scale Milky Way galaxy as an integral part, while still allowing online single player. It's the first in the series that has expanded with walking around known as space legs.

Elite is the longest running space simulation series in history. It has over 30 years of heritage. This is verified by Guinness World Records.^[1]^

Elite Dangerous is set in the same fictional universe called the Elite Universe. The Elite Dangerous page on this wiki has more information.

### What are the main features of Elite Dangerous?

- An immersive, evolving galaxy with dynamic society, economy and stories, allowing pilots to join each other and together change the story of the Milky Way.
- Player actions can change the narrative and history of humankind. Such as battle pirates, participate in community events, leaving a mark in the galaxy.
- There are no classes or skill levels, strength is decided by ship equipment and player skill.
- More than 30 different and customizable ships.
- Surface vehicles such as the Scarab to explore planets and moons.
- The vast 1:1 scale Milky Way galaxy is based on real scientific principles, scientific data, star catalogues and theories. It is created using a mix of procedural generation and artist direction.
    - Around 400 billion star systems according to current scientific theories of star system formation with planets and moons that orbit and rotate.
    - Groundbreaking in that it's based on a lot of hard science with all sorts of star surveys that are fixed and merged to for the first time in gaming history compose a very consistent model of the Milky Way galaxy and it's rich enough to plot the night sky.^[2]^
    - Alien life such as fungal life.
    - 141 nebula in the Milky Way galaxy.
    - Star Clusters with rich survey data opportunities.
    - 32 other galaxies are visible from the Milky Way.
    - Several sentient species in the galaxy. The most notable are Humans, Thargoids and Guardians. More species are yet to be discovered.
    - 57 Galactic Regions, 9 major galactic arms and the Galactic Plane.
    - Constellations can be seen from Sol.
- Flight Model of Elite Dangerous has Newtonian physics with a fly-by-wire layer applied over the top to make the combat feel visceral and seat-of-the-pants, rather than Frontier's jousting at huge distances. Newtonian space combat (ships will continue to move unless intervened but without orbital mechanics)
- Freeform (manual yaw/pitch/roll) interplanetary flight allows to fly freely through star systems in realistic scale to get to a destination. Players can choose to travel wherever they want, including vista points to see Earth rise on the moon, the sun appearing behind Mars, or they could choose to explore the vast expanse of space and discover new points of interest in star systems.
- Multicrew adds the ability to join a seat of another commander's ship or let others join your ship.
- Holo-Me is the name of the character customization feature for the player's commander. It allows deep character customization.
- Camera Suite is a fully functional third-person camera suite.
- Players can choose between the following game modes: Solo (single player), Private Group (only with friends and invited people) or Open Play (multiplayer, play with everyone).
- The Background Simulation is dynamic, complex and reflects the evolution of the known galaxy with ever changing power and system influence of factions in response to player behavior. Every station has its own demands and supply that change dynamically. Players on different platforms cannot directly play with each other. However, every player on every platform affects the same shared galaxy, star systems, factions and the dynamic background simulation.
- A shared narrative which is influenced by players on all different platforms. This occurs with community events like Salom√©, community goals and Powerplay activities. All of the meta data for the galaxy is shared between players. It's not traditional storytelling, rather an interactive, overarching narrative. Players have influenced and changed the course of events. The story unfolds in real time, in which players decide the outcomes and can be the stars. The latest information on in-game events and stories are reported on GalNet. See the Elite Dangerous Timeline for a chronological list of events.

The scope of Elite Dangerous is huge. It has expanded with ambitious features such as Atmospheric Landings and on-foot and out-of-ship activities also known as Space Legs. This includes FPS combat, walking around planets and stations, and including entering vehicles and visiting settlements on 1:1 scale populated living planets, multi-player crew and player executive controlled capital ships.

### Are there plans for other platforms to be supported?

* * *

### Does Elite Dangerous support Physically Based Rendering (PBR)?

* * *

### Does Elite Dangerous have positional damage?

Yes, the modules all have a position in or on the ship, and some calculations are done based on your armour to decide if there's any penetration at all (which gets more likely as your armour gets beaten up), then how far it's likely to penetrate and which modules are along the path of that penetration and might take damage (there's several more subtle rules, but that's the broad strokes).

* * *

### How can we travel those vast distances in such a huge galaxy?

1. **Hyperspace** drives are used to **travel from anywhere between star systems.** Hyperdrives with different ranges, charge up times and fuel consumption parameters are available, and so your particular model of hyperdrive governs your specific ability to move around the galaxy. The game ensures that you will get grouped with other ships near the star with the largest mass during hyperspace exit.

* * *

### How are players going to meet each other in such a huge galaxy?

You can use the Galaxy Map to navigate through the Milky Way galaxy. The System Map displays a system's layout and information. Most of the action will take place within the human populated core systems of the major factions. This region is known as The Bubble. It's where powers compete for influence, resources, territory and control. Powerplay is an ongoing battle for interstellar conquest and control in the galaxy.

Due to the way interstellar hyperspace travel works, the game will ensure that you will get grouped with other ships near the star with the largest mass during hyperspace exit. You will also be able to find other ships that are super-cruising within a star system from a long distance away visually and with long range sensors. There will also be ways to follow each other's hyperspace trail.

Multicrew is a feature introduced in 2.3. Multicrew adds the ability to join a seat of another commander's ship or let others join your ship, which can be done by being in a Team. You can only have up to 3 people in a ship which has enough seats. A crew of 3 people in a Multicrew set-up performs similarly to a Team of 3 ships.

Having such a large quantity of star systems permits the game to have many major discoveries and many more minor ones, enough for hundreds of thousands of players to experience the opportunity of unique finds without the feeling of tripping over the Ark of the Covenant every two minutes.

* * *

### Is there an extensive dynamic economy?

Yes, Elite: Dangerous involves a dynamic Background Simulation, reflecting the evolution of the known galaxy with ever changing power and system influence of factions in response to player behaviour. Every station has its own demands and supply that dynamically change.

Elite: Dangerous features a complex background simulation which drives a dynamic system of ever changing power and influence. Struggles between minor factions are commonplace throughout the galaxy and are led by the actions of player commanders both inadvertently and intentionally through the mission system and other activities. Many players enjoy actively supporting a chosen faction indefinitely; helping to win their battles, defending territory and expanding the faction's operations into nearby star systems - ultimately building a small empire in their chosen sector of space. Playing the game this way offers an almost strategic, board game like experience and it can be immensely satisfying when your goals and objectives are met. Player actions can turn a small faction into an interstellar operation. It is important to note that while altering the local politics of a star system ‚Äãcan be done by a lone commander, it will be far easier in groups of people all working towards a common goal, particularly as the faction grows. Where there is unity, there is victory. ^[9]^

- Trading
- Factions

* * *

### Are there any missions or quests?

Yes, missions fall into several types, the ones that you find en route and the ones that will have you actively engage in through a contract. These can earn you both credits and status within the faction you are working for, whether it is a disreputable criminal group or the Federation or Empire themselves. Scenario Missions feature voice acting and storytelling.

- Roleplaying
- Passenger Carrier
- Ranks

* * *

### Are there any roleplaying elements?

Just like in all the previous Elite games, you are **not** fixed to a specific role like in a traditional roleplaying game: there are no skill points that directly affect the way your avatar performs. Instead you will always be directly in control of your avatar so your own skill will determine the outcome of your interactions.

### Will I be able to smuggle illegal goods?

Yes

- Smuggling
- Crime & Punishment
- Trading
- Slaves

* * *

### Is there any mining?

Yes, just like the last two Elite games, there is mining. Mining can be done from Asteroids and **Planetary Ring Systems**, or by salvaging.

- Miner
- Explorer
- Salvage

* * *

### Is Elite Dangerous Groundbreaking?

Yes, it's groundbreaking in that the galaxy is based on a lot of hard science with all sorts of star surveys that are fixed and merged to, for the first time in gaming history, compose a very consistent model of the Milky Way galaxy and it's rich enough to plot the night sky.^[2]^ It's also one of the first major titles to offer full virtual reality support with an exceptionally immersive experience in an all-encompassing universe, and every player on every platform affects the same shared galaxy with an interactive overarching narrative via the background simulation.

* * *

### I heard that the Elite series has no actual storyline. Is that true?

**No**. Elite Dangerous features a shared narrative which is influenced by players on all different platforms. This occurs with community events like Salom√©, community goals and Powerplay activities. All of the meta data for the galaxy is shared between players. It's not traditional storytelling, rather an interactive, overarching narrative. Players have influenced and changed the course of events. The story unfolds in real time, in which players decide the outcomes and can be the stars. The latest information on in-game events and stories are reported on GalNet.

### Will I be able to hire crew for my ship?

* * *

### Can I hire teammates?

* * *

### Will it be possible to manually land on planets?

    - Keep in mind that the game has been  with all these features in mind (it is **not** an afterthought) and Frontier Developments already has the technology for this.

- Development Plan

* * *

### Will landing and docking be seamless in Elite Dangerous?

**Yes**, just like in all the previous *Elite* games you are able to manually dock with space stations seamlessly. Future expansions will also add the possibility to seamlessly freeform land on planets. Landing and docking will be doable either using auto pilot, or manually.

- Docking
- Planetary Landings
- Atmospheric Landings
- Development Plan

* * *

### Will gas giants be realistically represented?

    - Yes, there are gassy and cloudy gas giants.

* * *

### Can I walk around the ship, planets and space stations?

The expansion *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey* added On Foot functionality, the ability for players to disembark from their ships and explore planetary surfaces, settlements, and station Concourses.

It has always been a core vision of David Braben that the player is a person in a real futuristic setting, not just a ship. In 2016, Braben confirmed that Frontier Developments was working on walking about features: "Yes. We have ongoing work on planets, including atmospheres, planetary life, walking about and lots of other very exciting things for the future."^[10]^

- Development Plans

* * *

### How big are planets and star systems?

- Star system
- Galaxy Map
- Galaxy
- Planets
- Moons
- Stars

* * *

### Do planets rotate and orbit around stars?

* * *

### Can I create my own character?

Yes, the player can customize their commander via the Holo-Me interface, introduced in *Elite Dangerous: Horizons*. The player's outfit, physical features, and gender can be changed using Holo-Me at any time.

*Elite Dangerous: Odyssey* adds the ability to equip the player with three additional types of Suits that are specialized for different activities, as well as Handheld Weapons for On Foot combat.

* * *

### Are there alien lifeforms?

There are many species and sub-species of non-sentient alien life that can be encountered both in space and on terrestrial worlds. These lifeforms are typically analogous to plants, fungi, or micro-organisms. Note that some of these species can only be seen On Foot, which requires owning *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*. A number of non-sentient species are also indirectly present in the game in the form of certain Rare Commodities that can be traded at ports.

The only known sentient species are humans, Thargoids, and Guardians. Currently, only Thargoid ships and other biomechanical constructs can be encountered, and these are often hostile. The Guardians went extinct millions of years ago, but their ruins and relics can still be found across the galaxy.

* * *

### How many ships are flyable by players in Elite Dangerous?

There are 36 flyable ships and 6 flyable ship launched fighters, and there are plans for more ships with major updates. Both new, modified, and improved models from the previous Elite games.

* * *

### Can I own multiple ships?

Yes, there is no limit to the amount of ships you can own, but you can only fly one at a time.

- Ships
- Shipyard

* * *

### Can I own and control capital ships?

Players can purchase a Fleet Carrier, a Capital Ship with Landing Pads to accommodate smaller ships. Fleet Carriers cannot be piloted directly by the player, but can be jumped almost anywhere in the galaxy provided they are supplied with Tritium fuel. Players can also install a variety of optional services for other players to use. Owning a Fleet Carrier requires being able to pay a weekly upkeep fee of credits, otherwise the vessel will be decommissioned. Fleet Carriers can be customized with different paintjobs and layouts.

Other large-scale ships exist, such as Megaships, Farragut-Class Battle Cruisers, and Majestic-Class Interdictors, but these are restricted to NPC ownership. In the launch livestream for *Elite Dangerous: Horizons* update 2.3, a viewer asked "any chance of playing capital ships in the future?", David Braben answered: "it's on the list, but a long way down it, because there's a lot of gameplay to make it work. The issue is what we call the difference between direct control and executive control. Where rather than flying by the seat of your pants you're giving orders to a giant ship. Because you can't expect it to change course very rapidly and that sort of thing. So it's certainly a long-term possibility, but it's long-term."^[11]^

* * *

### Can I build an empire and own space stations and fleets?

Question: "Will it be possible to own a fleet of ships, staffed by NPCs and given orders to follow so that they trade or scout or mine ore etc?" David Braben answered: "With time we will add this sort of functionality to some degree, but we don't want it to be the be all, end all of the game."^[12]^ 

The third expansion Elite Dangerous: Beyond planned to add Fleet Carriers in Q4 2018, but this feature has been delayed to a future update. Fleet Carriers will be very large capital ships that will serve as mobile bases. They will be purchasable by Squadrons, which are like player-managed guilds.

- Development Plans

* * *

### Why are the ships simpler in design compared to other games?

    - The **ships** in *Elite: Dangerous* have **airlocks,** proper mass distribution with no off-centre main thrusters and separate tessellated cargo holds.

* * *

### Can I use other vehicles?

Aside from standard ships, players can also directly control Surface Recon Vehicles (SRVs) and Ship-Launched Fighters (SLFs), both of which were added in *Elite Dangerous: Horizons*.

* * *

### Can I make Cinematic Videos?

Yes, the Camera Suite is a fully functional third-person camera suite. It lets players take sophisticated screenshots, make cinematic videos and fly ships in third person. It succeeds the old Debug Camera and is part of update 2.3 The Commanders. In the revamped version you can move around much quicker and further away from your ship. There's a UI legend of shortcuts which can be hidden, and it features a zoom slider. You can lock the camera to your ship and are able to control the ship in a third-person perspective. The camera can ignore rotation so it has the same orientation.

* * *

### How do I play Elite Dangerous?

Please check the Pilots Guide on this wiki. It is designed to help a new or experienced pilot get the most out of their ships.

It is also recommended that new pilots check out the following guides:

* * *

### Why is yaw so slow?

* * *

### Are there Newtonian physics?

**Yes**, the flight model of Elite Dangerous has Newtonian physics with a fly-by-wire layer applied over the top to make the combat feel visceral and seat-of-the-pants, rather than Frontier's jousting at huge distances.

Here some quotes from the creator David Braben:

* * *

### Can I manually fire thrusters in every direction?

Yes the game allows for full 6DOF motion.

* * *

### Is Elite Dangerous an MMO?

Players can choose between the following game modes: Solo (single player), Private Group (only with friends and invited people) or Open Play (multiplayer, play with everyone). In open play, you may encounter any other player who is also in Open, instancing and matching players occurs via a complex system. Players on different platforms cannot directly play with each other. However, every player on every platform affects the same shared galaxy, star systems, factions and the dynamic Background Simulation.

The game features a shared persistent galaxy, where macro effects and events such as economy, society and war status etc. are recorded and shared across all the different platforms. So all players influence the same shared galaxy.

The effects of those instances are then stored on the central galaxy server and shared by everybody.

Because the game features very high speed twitch combat and very detailed damage models, this is the most reliable way to do it, also keep in mind there can be many sessions within a star system and those sessions can dynamically move around, also because this game uses a 1:1 scale Milky Way galaxy, sessions will typically be spread out much further away (although most of the action will be within the core systems) and it wouldn't be immersion breaking as opposed to a space game in a smaller area.

- How are players going to meet each other in such a huge galaxy?
- Squadrons
- Teams
- Insurance costs
- Death

* * *

### How does singleplayer work? Will I need an internet connection to play?

Yes, *Elite Dangerous* requires an internet connection to play. The online galaxy of *Elite Dangerous* is a shared universe maintained by a central server. All of the meta data for the galaxy is shared between players across all platforms. This includes the galaxy itself as well as transient information like economies. The aim here is that a player's actions will influence the development of the galaxy, without necessarily having to play multiplayer.

The other important aspect for the developers is that they can seed the galaxy with events, often these events will be triggered by player actions. With a living breathing galaxy players can discover new and interesting things long after they have started playing.

* * *

### Does Elite Dangerous have a monthly subscription fee?

No, *Elite Dangerous* does not use a paid subscription model. Playing only requires a one-time purchase of the *Elite Dangerous* base game.

Cosmetic items and premium expansions such as *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey* are sold separately.

* * *

### Is Elite Dangerous Pay-To-Win?

*Elite Dangerous* is not pay-to-win. All ships, modules, ranks, permits, and credits must be earned in-game, and cannot be bought with real money.

All premium Livery items are entirely cosmetic and do not affect a player's performance in gameplay.

* * *

### What are the expansions?

Thus far, *Elite Dangerous* has received two paid expansions:

- *Elite Dangerous: Horizons* (2015)
- *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey* (2021)

*Horizons* also included the free content season *Elite Dangerous: Beyond*.

On October 27, 2020, *Horizons* was converted into a free expansion and rolled into the base game, giving all players access to its content.

*Odyssey* is the latest expansion for the game and will continue to receive updates for the foreseeable future.

* * *

### What are the future development plans?

* * *

### Does Elite Dangerous support Virtual Reality Gaming?

Yes, Elite Dangerous is a groundbreaking title for virtual reality gaming, because its one of the first major titles to offer full VR support with an exceptionally immersive experience in an all-encompassing universe. It was the go to game for many VR headset demos before the devices were commercially available. From a technical standpoint, Elite Dangerous is one of the PC‚Äôs most high-end VR titles, pushing even very powerful PCs to their limit.

Elite Dangerous is designed from the ground up to support Virtual Reality and 4K Ultra HD display technology. It has Cutting-edge visual quality and performance enabled by Frontier's COBRA engine. It supports the latest displays at 4K resolution, and is built for the future with full 8K and 16K support. It's compatible with Oculus Rift, SteamVR and Vive headsets.^[8]^
