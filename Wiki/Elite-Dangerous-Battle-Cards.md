**Elite Dangerous Battle Cards** is a card game developed for the *Elite Dangerous* setting.

Battle in asteroid belts to gain cover against enemy attacks, explore planets to gain advantage over your foe, or send a fleet of transports to construct an unstoppable capital ship. Create an armada of spaceships, fighters, warships â€“ even entire space stations. Use special abilities to outflank your enemy, upgrade your vessels with enhanced equipment or play action cards to save your ships or foil your opponent.^[1]^

Control the fate of the galaxy across three battle zones, each with its own special mission which influences your cards and determines ultimate victory. Build a speed deck to get the drop on your opponent, or grind them down with your industrial power and superior economy.^[1]^
