**Olgrea** is an Allied system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It was first colonized in 3224 by a Federal expedition led by Mic Turner. After helping to found the Alliance in 3230, Turner returned to Olgrea in 3239 in command of an Alliance fleet that swiftly captured critical infrastructure and forced the Federation to withdraw. Olgrea has served as one of the Alliance's leading industrial centres ever since.

*"Mic Turner, the intergalactic Explorer, ship designer and founder of the Alliance, led the Federation expeditionary team that brought colonists to Olgrea in 3224."*^[1]^

*"Terraforming operations began almost immediately as the Federation could see that further population growth in the region would require room to accommodate."*^[1]^

*"In 3239, Alliance warships and Turner's command return to the system and after a short altercation with Federal forces won control of Fortress Jung and New Casablanca. After this it was only a matter of time before the rest of the system surrendered and the Federation withdrew."*^[1]^

*"By 3250, the Olgrea system had become a massive part of the Alliance infrastructure. The Planet New Gotham became the centre of agricultural production for the entire Alliance sector. The system population had grown to approach 100 million inhabitants, one of the fastest system migrations in interstellar history."*^[1]^
