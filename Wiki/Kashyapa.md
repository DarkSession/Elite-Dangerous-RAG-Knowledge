> Commander Edgar Starwalker recommends this spectacular Ringed Earth-like world with exactly 1G. When this spectacle was discovered by the Chapterhouse Mission to Jaques and news broke back on Kamadhenu, a local sect of sadhus interpreted this as fulfillment of a prophecy. They saw the ringed ELW as "Kashyapa" - the legendary consort of Mother Kamadhenu, a fabled paradise - and are now fixated on one day establishing a religious retreat in this system. In parallel to this the Chapterhouse themselves hope this place will one day act as a gateway to the new frontier of the Colonia Nebula for settles and freight.
