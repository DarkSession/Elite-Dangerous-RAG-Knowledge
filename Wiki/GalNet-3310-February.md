### Harvest Thargoid Materials for Anti-Titan Project

**\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\***

Aegis is urgently requesting deliveries of Thargoid spire site materials to Professor Ishmael Palin in the Arque system.

The alien minerals are needed for vital research based on a new theory by the engineer Ram Tah. His research has suggested a method of defeating the Thargoid Titans, although details of the proposal remain classified by Aegis.

Professor Palin, the leading expert in Thargoid biotechnology, explained the initiative:

“*I am confident that Ram Tah's theory holds water, and we are working together on its practical applications. There are no guarantees as yet, but we could be on the cusp of developing a weapon with which to engage the Titans*.”

“*However, such a weapon must be able to function within the Maelstroms’ electromagnetic fields, which disrupt all Guardian-based technology. I am developing a resistant armour using the organic compounds produced by Thargoid spire sites.*”

Aegis has cautioned pilots that operating within the spire sites is highly dangerous, and that they are likely to encounter Thargoid vessels as well as defensive drones. Anti-xeno strategist Aden Tanner commented:

“*I won’t pretend to understand all the science behind Ram Tah and Palin’s work. But what little I’ve seen made me feel something very rare these days: hope. There’s never been a more crucial time for everyone to rally together, and perhaps help us achieve the impossible*.”

Deliveries of coral sap, impure spire minerals and semi-refined spire minerals can be made at Austen Town Station in the Arque system.

### Anti-Titan Project Boosted by Thargoid Spire Materials

**\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\***

Chemicals harvested from Thargoid spire sites have accelerated Aegis’s development of a weapon to destroy the Titans.

Professor Ishmael Palin requested samples of coral sap, impure spire minerals and semi-refined spire minerals, which were delivered to the Arque system. These will be used to produce an armoured layer to protect the weapon against the Maelstroms’ anti-Guardian zones.

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis, explained more at a press conference:

“*I am well aware that obtaining these substances from the Thargoid spire sites has doubtless cost lives. But the importance of this work cannot be overstated. Without resistance to the Maelstroms’ electromagnetic fields, the weapon based on Ram Tah’s theory is doomed to failure*.”

“*The Alliance, Empire and Federation have all agreed to redirect the majority of Aegis funding to the anti-Titan project. We have also drafted in extra help to construct prototypes and fast-track testing procedures. Although details remain classified, if the results continue to be positive, we may be able to go public in as little as a week*.”

Aegis has confirmed that all those who contributed to this initiative can now collect their rewards from Austen Town Station in the Arque system.

### Catastrophic Earthquakes Strike Rhea 3

A series of high-magnitude earthquakes on the planet Rhea 3 have caused widespread devastation and millions of casualties.

Massive seismic activity across the northern continent has effectively shattered dozens of towns and cities, including the capital New Greenacre. The intense tremors also triggered tsunamis in the surrounding oceans, which have wrecked coastal regions on other land masses.

Local journalist Len Kennelly published a summary for Vox Galactica:

“*The only disaster on this scale that we’ve seen in Rhea was when NMLA terrorists bombed Ito Orbital. This time, however, the death toll could run into tens of millions. Urban skylines have crumbled like sandcastles, with vast jagged pits opening up to swallow entire neighbourhoods*.”

“*Federal Liberal Command has declared the highest state of emergency, calling for volunteers to help rescue trapped citizens. We’re seeing direct support from other factions in the system, and Federal Navy specialists are coordinating relief efforts. The humanitarian organisation Safeguard Interstellar is also here in force, providing supplies and temporary shelters for survivors*.”

Sofia Trevino, political correspondent for The Federal Times, reported:

“*As soon as this news broke, President-elect Felicia Winters – a native of Rhea 3 and the system’s representative in Congress – immediately cancelled her schedule and travelled to her homeworld. Unverified reports claim that contact has been lost with members of her family, most of whom lived in the capital*.”

“*Speculation has already begun that this might cause further delays to the beginning of Winters’s term of office. Vice President-elect Isolde Rochester made a statement asking for patience, claiming: ‘Our focus right now should be on aiding those affected by this tragedy.’*”

### Guardian Nanite Torpedoes Enter Production

**\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\***

Deliveries are urgently needed to begin manufacturing a new weapon capable of causing severe damage to Thargoid Titans.

Professor Ishmael Palin has been leading on the project, using theories developed by Ram Tah. Aegis released an official statement on all newsfeeds:

“*We can now reveal the results of Ram Tah’s experiments into Guardian relics. These ancient objects were crystalline supercomputers that relayed data across the Guardians’ information networks. His theory was that their transformation into Unclassified relics at Thargoid surface sites was caused by an inbuilt defence mechanism, which could perhaps be weaponised*.”

“*Ram Tah discovered that exposure to certain electromagnetic frequencies caused Guardian relics to open and activate clusters of microscopic nanites. These react aggressively against Thargoid biotechnology by disrupting it on the molecular level. Most significantly, tests proved that these nanites are unaffected by the anti-Guardian field generated within Maelstroms*.”

“*Professor Palin, aided by Aegis technicians, has used Guardian-hybrid engineering to construct a ‘soft’ warhead that delivers a nanite payload. The torpedo is armoured using organic compounds from Thargoid spire sites, to prevent anti-Guardian fields affecting it in flight. Our strategists believe that these weapons could affect a Titan’s heat regulation systems, causing internal damage and eventually even total destruction*.”

“*Mass production of the Guardian nanite torpedo and its launcher module has begun. But further supplies are needed to construct enough for simultaneous attacks against all eight Thargoid motherships*.”

Aegis has asked for shipments of neofabric insulation, ion distributors and energy grid assemblies to be delivered to Clement Orbital in the YZ Ceti system. The initiative is being managed by YZ Ceti Blue Galactic and Co, which aims to protect deliveries by redeeming bounty vouchers on all wanted ships.

### Winters Pauses Inauguration After Rhea Disaster

President-elect Felicia Winters has delayed the start of her term of office, in response to devastating earthquakes on the planet Rhea 3.

The following statement was delivered by her office to a special session of Congress:

“*The terrible events on Rhea 3 have not only demanded President-elect Winters’s full attention, but also brought personal tragedy. It seems that most of the Winters family, plus many close friends, lost their lives when the capital city of New Greenacre was levelled by the earthquakes*.”

“*The president-elect therefore requests permission to temporarily suspend the inauguration ceremony. This will allow her to focus on coordinating emergency operations, and also process the unexpected loss of her nearest and dearest*.”

President Zachary Hudson agreed to a short extension of his presidential term, thereby allowing the motion to be passed by Congress. Vice President-elect Isolde Rochester will assume leadership of the Liberal Party on an interim basis until Felicia Winters is available.

Vox Galactica published an update from local reporter Len Kennelly:

“*Rescue operations on the northern continent have intensified in recent days, as more ships and equipment arrive from across the Federation. I’m told that nearly a million survivors, albeit many injured, have now been recovered. But continual aftershocks are still toppling unstable buildings, leaving entire cities lying in dust*.”

The Empirical scientific journal also discussed the cause of the disaster:

“*High-magnitude earthquakes are extremely rare on terraformed planets such as Rhea 3. Initial geological surveys usually detect this type of tectonic instability, to avoid establishing settlements in dangerous regions. These destructive tremors prove that despite having tamed many worlds with our technology, nature can still be unpredictable*.”

### Target the Titans – Guardian Nanite Torpedoes Released

**\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\***

Aegis is preparing concerted attacks against Thargoid Titans using the new weapons now available at rescue megaships.

A successful delivery campaign brought in enough supplies of neofabric insulation, ion distributors and energy grid assemblies to mass-produce the Guardian nanite torpedoes. YZ Ceti Blue Galactic and Co, acting on Aegis’s behalf, is distributing rewards and reimbursing bounty vouchers from Clement Orbital in the YZ Ceti system.

A press conference was held by Aegis leadership, including a statement from Professor Alba Tesreau:

“*The Guardian nanite torpedo is our most important invention yet. Once again, we are utilising the advanced sciences of the Thargoids’ ancient adversary. And once again, we are relying on pilots’ skill and determination to face the Titans at close quarters*.”

“*I am painfully aware that many abducted people are still in captivity aboard the Thargoid motherships. Scan results suggest that the majority have now been rescued, but those remaining may not survive these attacks. We are forced to accept that their sacrifice will result in fewer deaths than if the Titans are allowed to remain operational*.”

Anti-xeno strategist Aden Tanner discussed Aegis’s tactical approach:

“*These torpedoes must be aimed at the thermal vents on a Titan’s hull. A sufficiently large payload of Guardian nanites should paralyse these vents. The mothership will be forced to discharge the colossal heat it generates by exposing its inner regions to space. That will provide us with sensitive targets for more conventional weaponry to inflict serious – hopefully critical – damage*.”

“*Aegis has marshalled Allied, Federal and Imperial ships to undertake this mission, but we calculate they will not be enough. Only with the support of independent Commanders can we hope to deliver enough nanites to affect each Titan. This could prove to be the most important victory in humanity’s history… or our most devastating defeat. Now, more than ever, we need you all*.”

### The Assault on Taranis

Titan Taranis is under siege, taking major damage, and close to presenting a major turning point in the war against the Thargoids. This is an urgent call to all independent pilots to aid in the complete defeat of a Titan.

A recent surge of financial support has allowed Aegis to remove the material requirements for the following key modules:

- The Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser – the key to punching through the maelstrom’s defensive field and reach the centre.

- The Caustic Sink Launcher – a valuable tool to protect ships from the aggressive caustic fog permeating the cloud around the Titan.

This funding originated from numerous groups and individuals following the news about Ram Tah’s Guardian Nanite Torpedo technology being deployed to great effect against Taranis. Aegis wish to express that humanity will be forever grateful to those who risked their lives to make this happen.
