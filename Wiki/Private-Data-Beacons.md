# Private Data Beacons
Private Data Beacon
 		 	 

**Private Data Beacons** can be found in debris fields inside some Degraded Emissions and Encoded Emissions signal sources. They can be targeted and scanned for Common and Very Common Encoded Materials.

To collect the Encoded Materials, target the beacon, approach it to within 200 meters, and centre it in the ship's field of view. The ship's sensors will scan and retrieve any data automatically.

The data beacon is a black box, and it can be heard repeating the message "This is a black box flight recorder, please return it to the local starport."
