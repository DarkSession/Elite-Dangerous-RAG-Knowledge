This timeline covers events from the first three games of the Elite series as well as novels. There are some discrepancies between events listed and their representation in the fourth and current game, Elite Dangerous.

This is a fictional timeline and as such some listed events do not correspond to actual historical events such as if, when, and where they occurred in actual history.
