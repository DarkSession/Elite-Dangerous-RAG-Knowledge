# Elysian Shore
**Elysian Shore** is galactic region #33 in the Milky Way. It is bordered by Temple, the Inner Orion Spur, the Sanguineous Rim, Kepler's Crest, the Formidine Rift, the Errant Marches, and Vulcan Gate.

In 3270, Project Dynasty secretly dispatched four ill-fated expeditions to separate regions of the galaxy to identify Earth-like worlds for future colonisation. One of these expeditions arrived in Elysian Shore, at the time considered part of the Formidine Rift, and left four marker settlements.
