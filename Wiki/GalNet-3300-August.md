Thought to be as a result of a recent successful recruitment drive, which has seen a marked increased numbers of new Pilot Federaton members, all star ports have reported a significant rise in accidents and violations. Members are kindly advised to take extra care when approaching star ports and adhere to all docking and exiting protocols.

Demand for the new Docking Computers has exceeded analysts' expectations, with shipyards reporting these utility modules are more popular than the previous best selling C2 Pulse Laser.

Weekly Pilot Federation Member Profits:

254,976,324 credits profit generated from 602,873 units of cargo traded.

- Market Information

    - **Ship Sales (by market share)**

The significant mandatory ship recall that affected all shipyards this week has thrown the entire market into turmoil.
Faulcon deLacy benefited the most with sales of new Sidewinders commanding a very impressive 89 % of the market. Sales of the Cobra Mk III were decimated by the recall, so the launch of their long awaited Viper was accelerated.

Zorgon Peterson saw a remarkable turn of fortunes as their highly paid new marketing team helped the Hauler grab a 7 % market share this week.
The Core Dynamics Eagle struggled to keep up in contrast, capturing less than 2 % of the market.

Lakon had even less success with their new Type 6 trading ship this week, taking less than 1 % of the market. Time will tell how their Type 9 will fare.

    - **Space Camo**

As predicted, the Galaxy has become even more colourful with numerous sightings of Commanders sporting new paint jobs on their ships. The numbers of extreme retro ancient Earth camoflage designs have caused quite a stir — the purely decorative colours have left some veteran members shaking their heads in bemusement at the naivety of expecting ancient camo to be of benefit in space. A vox pop of some of the younger members commanders indicates they are aware of that thank you very much, but they want to ‘express themselves’. This one may run and run…
Meanwhile, the Core Dynamics Eagle Red Streak and Orange Mohawk are also proving popular, and we hear rumours that Faulcon deLacy is preparing new designs for its Viper heavy fighter.

    - **Fish**

Fish floated back to the top of the traded good charts this week.

A recent skills review undertaken by the Pilots Federation has shown a considerable improvement in the general flying skills of all members. Many members have credited the new Docking Computer as a valuable aid, which has seen a good uptake across all shipyards.

However, it would appear that although sales of Docking Computers have been very healthy over the past week, they have been outstripped by sales of Point Defence Turrets.

It is understood that many members are seeking to defend themselves against a growing numbers of missile attacks. The accuracy of heat seeking missiles is reputed to be over 70 % so there is clear concern amongst Pilots over the need for defence.

This may also explain the unexpected rise on the black market of personal weapons…

    - **Ship Sales (by market share)**

The ship market appears to have settled somewhat after last weeks shake up.

Zorgon Peterson’s Hauler continued to impress and grabbed a staggering 39 % market share this week.

Falcon deLacy bolstered by their unexpected success last week, re-energized their Cobra Mk III sales to 17 % of the overall market and with rumours of new paint jobs becoming available soon their new Viper took 11 % of the market in anticipation. And showing their breadth of the market, their high-end Anaconda started to make its mark with some encouraging initial sales.

The Core Dynamics Eagle left its struggles behind with an almost 15 % market share.

Lakon’s versatile new trader, The Type 6 increased in popularity but their Type 9 is off to a slow start.

Rumours of potential supply-side restrictions are starting to reach us. Well-placed sources indicate that galactic macro-economic factors may soon start to affect the recent stable trading market, forcing members to look beyond the familiar routes, or to new activities, for continued profit.

We will of course issue a high priority info-alert should as soon as we uncover any more solid information.

The ship market is surging ahead now as pilots earn more credits.

Zorgon Peterson’s Hauler has become the market darling, shrugging off recent troubles — the new ZP marketing team is really shining with the Hauler holding on to the number 1 spot with 29,2 % market share.

Falcon deLacy held on to second place with a 16,6 % market share for their Cobra Mk III, their Viper gradually increasing share to 13,7 % of the overall market and their high-end Anaconda really gaining traction with nouveau riche pilots on 3,4 % market share.

The Core Dynamics Eagle fell away slightly with 13 % market share.

Lakon’s versatile Type 6 trader weighed in with a solid 16,6 % market share, and the Type 9 showed signs of positive momentum on 5,1 %.

The stalemate between the Federation and the Eranin Defence forces continues, with an almost equal number of Combat Bonds being issued by both sides to Commanders willing to aid in the struggle for dominance in the area.

But the Federation security forces continue to issue the highest number of bounties for infractions, with the Independant Systems of Eranin and Aganippe giving the next highest contribution towards law and order.

- News Alert!

A recent «Wanted Dead or Alive» bulletin from the Galactic Security services noted that two Commanders continue to evade the System Authorities with accumulated bounties of over 100,000 credits each.

They were last seen flying a Faulcon deLacy Cobra Mk III and a Lakon Type 6, so if you encounter them, please exercise extreme caution and remember to keep your engine boost systems fully repaired.

- And finally

    - Fish

Fish continue to be the poster child of the recent benign market conditions, with over 3,120,000 cargo units bought in the past week. Perhaps dwindling stocks due to over-fishing may be a contributory factor to the rumoured forthcoming general supply squeeze?

The rumours of a financial scandal currently engulfing the Federation government have knocked confidence in federal debt to the point where many now regard it as toxic. This seems to be triggering a Federation-wide credit-crunch that has affected both the stock levels that merchants are willing to hold, and the levels of industrial and consumer demand.

- GalNet Credit Crunch Special Feature

The Federation credit crunch is reducing stocks and demand across systems, dramatically altering the market situation and forcing pilots to look for new routes.

These graphs of stock levels illustrate the effect, and make grim reading:

    - Personal Weapons at Beagle 2 Landing

    - Biowaste in Freeport

    - Even Fish stocks in Chango Dock are starting to sink…

    - We can see that as merchants are now unwilling to hold much stock, the normal value of trading is wiping out supplies and leaving the markets with only sporadic trades.

But, all is not lost. Look at these examples of the market for Tea. The first graph is from Azeban City, a previously heavily traded market for Tea:

So far, so familiar.

But, in Dezhurov Gateway where Tea was historically lightly traded, we see a different situation with merchants able to meet market demands:
Commanders: the message is clear — the markets are out there, so get in your ships and find them!

Zorgon Peterson’s Hauler holds on to it number 1 spot with 26,4 % market share. ZP had better give its hungry new marketing team a pay rise to secure their services!

Faulcon deLacy’s Cobra Mk III holds second place with an increased market share of 19,4 %, the Viper gained even more share to 15,1 % and their high-end Anaconda continues it positive momentum increasing to 4,3 % market share. That all adds up to an impressive 38,8 % combined market share for Faulcon deLacy ships.

Demand for the Core Dynamics Eagle continues to slightly soften this week to 12,7 %.

Lakon’s versatile Type 6 trader again put in a dependable 16,1 % market share, and the larger Type 9 continued its upward trend to 6,0 %.

- Elite Pilots Federation Alert

Pilots need to beware that, following a dramatic increase in the amount of goods being traded on the black market, particularly Tobacco and Gold, the authorities are cracking down. It is thought that the increase in smuggling stolen goods may be as a result of a recent pirate propaganda video or may point to a breakdown in the legal system. Either way there will be zero tolerance if pilots are found with counterfeit goods in their cargo and new measures have been put in place to ensure all stolen goods are tracked.

    - **Ship Sales (by market share)**

Zorgon Peterson continued to maintain its grip this week. Their best selling trading ship, the Hauler is proving its worth with almost one third of market share. They certainly seem to have what the market wants!

Faulcon deLacy, sees no change in its 38 % market share this week with steady sales of the Cobra but a slight decline in Anaconda sales. They are clearly looking for inventive ways of keeping their market position as their Sales Director was recently overheard talking about a new exciting range of paint jobs for the Viper!

Core Dynamics saw an increase in Eagle sales this week up to 13,2 % , but Lakon saw a small drop in market share of both their Type 6 and Type 9 with 15 % and 5 % respectively.
