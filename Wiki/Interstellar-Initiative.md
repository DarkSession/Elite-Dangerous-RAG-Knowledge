# Interstellar Initiative
**Interstellar Initiatives** are a community activity comparable to an enhanced form of Community Goals. They feature a series of events that play out over the course of a month with multiple phases and an evolving narrative. Some Interstellar Initiatives will have a lasting effect on the galaxy, and can add a new module or Synthesis recipe, affect the infrastructure of a system, or even alter the balance of power between the superpowers.^[1]^
