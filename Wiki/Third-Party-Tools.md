## Databases

*\* These are used by some of the apps listed at the bottom.*

### EDDN

- "The Elite: Dangerous Data Network is a system for willing Commanders to share dynamic data about the galaxy with others. By pooling data in a common format, tools and analyses can be produced that add an even greater depth and vibrancy to the in-game universe."
- EDDN is replacing EMDN (Elite Market Dump Network) by Andreas since FD changed their policy to disallow data scraping in Elite Dangerous (see details in the FD forums post).
- EDDN is used by a few apps and web sites to exchange commodity pricing information. It does not currently (2015-03-29) share data about systems and stationsÂ : landing pad sizes, distances, etc.
- EliteOCR and RegulatedNoise can both push data easily on EDDN while respecting current FD's policies (2015-03-29).

### EDSM

- Creator: AnthorNet
- "EDSM (Elite Dangerous Star Map) was at first a community effort to store and calculate systems coordinates around the Elite: Dangerous galaxy.
