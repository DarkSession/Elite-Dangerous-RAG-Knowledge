Star Rise and a Corvette
 		 	 

A **star rise** is the moment when a star appears from behind a planet, moon or asteroid. It can be viewed from space by having a ship in front of a planet and wait till the star appears. A star rises and sets according to the orbital period of a celestial object such as a planet or asteroid orbiting a star. Exoplanets are planets that orbit a star outside of a star system.

A **star set** is the moment when a star disappears behind a planet, moon or asteroid.
