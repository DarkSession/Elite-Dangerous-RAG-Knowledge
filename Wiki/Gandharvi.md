> Commander Edgar Starwalker suggested visiting this Earth-like world discovered during the Chapterhouse's August 3302 Repair mission to Jaques. The group hopes that this world and system could one day play host to a stepping stone base towards Colonia, as well as a staging ground for wider Imperial exploration efforts of this region of the Scutum-Crux Arm. Gandharvi is another of the children of Kamadhenu in Hindu mythology.
