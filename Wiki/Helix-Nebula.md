The **Helix Nebula** is a small nebula in the Inner Orion Spur located approximately 700 light-years from Sol, below the Galactic Plane. Although the nebula was formed by a decaying star that should have created or be in the process of creating a white dwarf, there are no stars of any kind within the nebula. Consequently, the Helix Nebula cannot be traveled to directly, and can only be observed from nearby systems, such as CSI-21-22270.
