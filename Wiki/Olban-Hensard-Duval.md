**Olban Hensard Duval** was the 10th Emperor of the Empire from 2943 to 2991.^[1]^

Unlike his father, Olban preferred taking a subtle approach to interstellar politics, exemplified by Imperial involvement in disputes in the Liaedin system in 2945,^[2]^ and in Zeaex in 2951, when the Empire empowered Erronsa and Francis Ashfield in their conflict over mining rights with Grambourne Cambridge of the Federation.^[3]^ Olban demonstrated he was not afraid to use force in 2959, when an Imperial strike force with The Emperor's Own invaded the Laedla system and overwhelmed the Federation garrison on Mansfield, an event known as "Lightning Thursday".^[4]^ In 2976, Olban ordered the second major military assembly of his reign in response to the alleged assassination by Federal agents of Francis Ashfield, but conflict was averted when the settlers of Newtown in Zeaex sent a personal appeal to both the Federation and the Empire, which resolved the matter of mining rights and established an uneasy truce.^[5]^

## Timeline

22 NOV 3307

- An expert larcenist known as the Winking Cat has triggered widespread alarm with a spree of high-profile thefts. Vox Galactica published this feature by crime correspondent Mira Bukowski: "Last month, the galaxy's most infamous thief reappeared in the headlines after a long absence. It appears the Winking Cat is making up for lost time by stealing multiple items in quick succession. One notable target was a portrait of Emperor Olban Hensard Duval, the tenth ruler of the Empire. Painted in 2989, it was notable for being seven metres high - as was the graphic of a smirking feline face engraved on the wall where it once hung. Another disappearance, albeit of a less artistic nature, was the only working prototype of Achilles Corporation's XS1001 security robot. This was being guarded by several XS801 models which, according to insiders, were found lying on their sides and emitting an unusual 'purring' sound. There are reports of several other rare or precious artefacts disappearing from secure locations. In all cases, there are no clues as to how security systems were circumvented. The Wallglass Investigations Agency has theorised that the Winking Cat may not be an individual after all, but a group of criminal specialists working together. They also suspect that these latest thefts may be intended for some larger purpose."^[6]^
