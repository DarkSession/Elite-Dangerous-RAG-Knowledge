# Thermal Vent
**Thermal Vent** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to Beam Lasers through Engineering. It is an experimental upgrade that increases heat dissipation when successfully striking a target, at the cost of increased heat generation when the beam does not connect with a target. When striking a target, Thermal Vent beams vent more heat than they generate up to a certain point, reducing both Thermal Load on the weapon and the ship's own heat level.

Perhaps counter-intuitively, the Short Range modification is the most efficient option for venting heat quickly. This is because Thermal Vent will discharge heat in direct proportion to the Thermal Load of the laser itself; therefore, the +40% Thermal Load from grade 5 Short Range will enable the weapon to vent more heat in a shorter amount of time. For all practical reasons, Long range is the preferred choice for TV beams because it preserves  the already high default heat generated, along side increased damage due to removing damage falloff. Thermal Vent is especially useful for ships with sensitive heat characteristics, such as the Mamba. Caution is required with this tactic, however, as the increased heat generation from missing will also rise proportionately.

## Applicability

This effect is available for the following weapons:

- Beam Laser

## Required Materials

- 5x Flawed Focus Crystals
- 3x Conductive Polymers
- 3x Precipitated Alloys

## Notes

- As Thermal Vent reduces the ship's own heat level, it can cause the ship's canopy to ice over.
