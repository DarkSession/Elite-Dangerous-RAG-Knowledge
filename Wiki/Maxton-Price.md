Federal Navy Admiral

**Maxton Price** is an admiral of the Federal Navy. In June 3302, following reports that Federal ships operating in the Pleiades Nebula system of Merope were firing on independent pilots investigating Thargoid Barnacles, Price issued a statement insisting that the Federation had legitimate, peaceful intentions in the region, and would only fire upon other ships in self-defence. Despite this assurance, there were further reports of unprovoked attacks by Federal ships in Merope.

## Timeline

01 JUL 3302

- Despite assertions from Admiral Maxton Price that Federal ships in Merope would not initiate conflict, a recent incident report tells a different story. The report claims that a clearly marked Asp Explorer science vessel was shot down, without provocation, by Federal vessels above Merope 2 A. Rescue teams from Obsidian Orbital, responding to a distress call, found the smoking wreckage of the ship a short distance from a barnacle site guarded by a Farragut Battle Cruiser and a squadron of combat ships. The pilot – a captain in the Federal Auxiliary Navy – was only slightly injured. A spokesperson for the Federal Auxiliary Navy said: "A lone Asp with retracted weapons is no threat to a battle group, and the Navy can't shoot whomever they want without jurisdiction. If one of my boys ignored the rules of engagement like that, I'd throw the book at them. Admiral Price can expect a formal inquiry from the JAG as soon as the paperwork is done." The Federation has not issued an official response.^[1]^

- Following a recent statement from Admiral Maxton Price of the Federal Navy concerning Farragut Battle Cruisers in the Merope system, Dr Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group has responded: "Admiral Price's authoritative assurance is most welcome. Canonneers and other researchers can hereafter refer to his words as we learn more about the barnacles, and why the Unknown Artefacts point towards Merope." Dr Arcanonn also confirmed that barnacle sites had been located in the Witch Head Nebula, while Canonn vessels continue to search for barnacles in other nebulae. Concluding his statement, Dr Arcanonn commented on the elusive Unknown Probes – believed to be related to Unknown Artefacts. "We are now examining an Unknown Probe secured by my esteemed colleague Professor Monkey D Luffy. Early research indicates that it orients itself towards Merope 5 C, a site of barnacle proliferation. Obviously, Merope remains under intense scrutiny."

25 JUN 3302

- Admiral Maxton Price of the Federal Navy has rejected claims that Farragut Battle Cruisers stationed in Merope have made unprovoked attacks on independent pilots operating in the area. In a statement, Admiral Price argued that the allegations were baseless, and that the Federation had not initiated any conflict: "It is true that Federal vessels have exchanged fire with independent pilots, but these exchanges were not instigated by the Federation, and any claims to the contrary are false." Admiral Price was asked to respond to calls from Dr Arcanonn of the Canonn Interstellar Research Group for a public inquiry into the Federal presence in Merope. He responded: "The presence of Federal ships in Merope is entirely legitimate. If our ships are fired upon, they will respond in kind, but I can assure you that the Federation does not have a military agenda in Merope."^[3]^
