**Hull Reinforcement Packages** are used to strengthen the hull against attacks. They add hull points as well as resistance against all damage types.

They are available up to class 5 and in ratings D and E only. Compared to D-rated ones the E-rated ones are twice as heavy and offer 30-40 less hull Points, but are cheaper.

## Engineer Modifications

The following modifications can be applied to this module by Engineers to enhance its abilities:

- Blast resistant
- Heavy duty
- Kinetic resistant
- Lightweight
- Thermal resistant

### Experimental Effects

The following Experimental Effects can be applied to the module:

- Angled Plating
- Deep Plating
- Layered Plating
- Reflective Plating

## Notes

- Can be installed in an optional Internal Compartment or Military Compartment.
- Does not protect modules from damage, only raises the value of hull integrity and resistance. Module Reinforcement Package is used to protect modules.

## Trivia

- Added in Update 1.2.
