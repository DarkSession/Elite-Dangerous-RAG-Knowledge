### Sirius Stock Price Fluctuates After ‘Unhinged’ Trading Patterns

Recent moves by Sirius Corporation have resulted in an uncharacteristic wobble in stock prices, according to Money Matters.

In an exclusive story, economist Roberta Unwin has revealed increasingly aggressive attempts by Li Yong-Rui to initiate a corporate takeover of Achilles Aerospace. Thus far, these attempts have proven unsuccessful.

Unwin went on to say:

“*The current darling of the technology world, Achilles is riding a wave of momentum following the release of the SCO Frame Shift Drive. This breakthrough risks dislodging Sirius’s monopoly on FSD technology for the first time in over a decade. According to my sources, Li is increasingly unhappy with the challenge to his dominance of the aerospace industry*.”

“*I’ve heard phenomenal numbers when detailing Sirius’s multiple offers to purchase Achilles Aerospace and its proprietary SCO designs. Maxine Patro remains unswayed and has kept Achilles’ board members on her side. A company insider described Li’s obsession with Achilles as ‘unhinged’*.”

“*Sirius Corporation has recently acquired several smaller corporations across the core systems, most of which relate to aerospace and technological research. But a perceived lack of short-term strategy has unnerved some investors, with this week’s 3.9% share price drop costing the megacorp trillions*.”

In recent weeks Sirius Corporation has sought to pressure Pranav Antal and the Utopia community into forging stronger links, with Li described as ‘enthusiastic’ about gaining access to Utopia’s advanced technological prototypes. Pranav Antal has warned that Sirius personnel are not welcome in Utopian communes, claiming to distrust Li’s motives.

“*Then again,” says Unwin, “It's hard to bet against Sirius Corporation for long. Li Yong-Rui is accustomed to getting what he wants eventually*.”

### Aegis: “Be Alert for Thargoid Counterattacks”

**\*Pilots’ Federation Alert\***

Aden Tanner, special military advisor to the Aegis project, has warned of the potential for targeted Thargoid assaults on key military locations.

Speaking during a recent graduation ceremony for the latest batch of Federal AX recruits, Tanner warned against complacency following the destruction of Titan Thor last month.

“*It may seem that we have the upper hand in this war. There’s no shame in taking pride in our accomplishments, and we’re certainly in a better place than when the Thargoid invasion started*.”

“*But the Thargoids are just as dangerous as they’ve ever been. Entering a conflict zone with anything less than full focus would be a terrible mistake. Think of how hard you’d fight if you thought the Thargoids were driving our fleets back a little further each day. That’s the situation our enemy finds themselves in*.”

“*In fact, while our forces push towards the remaining two Titans, Aegis is always watching for counter-attacking efforts behind our front lines. We know the Thargoids can travel via portal technology, allowing them to spring ambushes on our ports beyond any fleet blockades. What we're less clear on is how the aliens assign value to potential targets*.”

“*Important systems are well protected, but we're playing catch-up when predicting the Thargoids’ next move. When you join our AX forces in combat for the first time, remember: look out for each other, and always expect the unexpected*.”

### Winters Acknowledges Growing Calls for Inauguration

**President-elect Felicia Winters has discussed the growing discontent within Federal Congress over her delayed inauguration**.

A series of devastating earthquakes struck Winters’s home world of Rhea 3 in February this year. Millions were killed during the unprecedented disaster, including six members of Winter’s family in the destruction of the capital New Greenacre.

Winters took an extended leave of absence to direct relief and recovery efforts on Rhea 3, which included a widespread appeal for resources from the independent pilot community. But recent articles in Sol Today have suggested the goodwill for Winter’s situation may be wearing thin.

Political journalist Ewan Klein recently wrote:

“*When Winters first announced the delay to her inauguration, there was obvious resistance from her Republican opponents – though perhaps less so from President Hudson, who has remained in office temporarily. As more details of Rhea’s turmoil came to light, support for Winter’s choice on compassionate grounds increased*.”

“*Seven months later, however, some in Congress have started to wonder if Winters will ever overcome her grief and accept the presidency*.”

Winters has finally released a statement on the matter via the Federal Free Press:

“*Nothing can ever repair the hole left in my heart following the tragedy on Rhea 3. That pain is shared with millions of families affected by the catastrophe that befell our home world. We may never truly overcome it, but must resolve to move forward despite it*.”

“*And during our darkest hours, the outpouring of love and support from across the Federation has been a source of great strength. I was reminded a thousand times over of the charity, selflessness and warmth of Federal citizens. Your patience has been cherished, and it is time that your faith in me as president-elect is rewarded*.”

“*I plan to step back from personally directing the recovery of Rhea 3 in the near future, leaving the task in the capable hands of Rhea’s emergency aid and relief committee. When the time is right, my inauguration ceremony will proceed and I will humbly accept the role of President of the Federation*.”

### Thargoid Fleet Invades Shinrarta Dezhra

**\*Pilots’ Federation Alert\***

A Thargoid invasion fleet has emerged in the Shinrarta Dezhra system, catching AX forces behind front lines by surprise.

The massive alien force quickly struck ports in the system. Jameson Memorial remains online but damaged, with local AX forces rallying to protect the famous megamarket. An urgent call for aid by local governors has been made.

Aegis has agreed to remain focused on frontline against the final two Thargoid Titans, while Sirius Corporation establishes supply lines to Shinrarta Dezhra. Azimuth Corporation has offered to provide further incentives for pilots heading to the region. The Corporation’s Megaships, Spirit of Laelaps and Musashi, have moved to a nearby system, V886 Centauri, to lend further support.

The Pilots’ Federation has granted a temporary permit to all Commanders to access the system for two weeks. Early reports indicate that the Pilots’ Federation has taken notably high casualties, with hundreds of Commanders active in the region lost during the initial heavy fighting.

Pilots looking to assist the AX efforts should first sign up to the defence fleet by visiting Rescue Ship Cornwallis in the V886 Centauri system before progressing into Shinrarta Dezhra.

With Jameson Memorial unavailable for regular trade, two other megamarkets remain available: I Sola Prospect in Brestla, and Attilius Orbital in CD-43 11917.

### Shinrarta Dezhra Defence Fleet Prevails

The Thargoid invasion fleet that ambushed the Shinrarta Dezhra system last week has been successfully repelled.

Providing an update on behalf of the system was Florian Baljak, acting starport commander of Jameson Memorial:

“*The Thargoids swept through Shinrarta Dezhra hard and fast, taking our defences offline before we were able to regroup. It’s a miracle Jameson Memorial lasted until reinforcements could arrive*.”

“*We lost a lot of good people driving the aliens back. But thanks to the efforts of thousands of Commanders, along with auxiliary support from Sirius Corporation and Azimuth Corporation, we can say victory in this particular battle*.”

Work has commenced on bringing all system ports back online as quickly as possible. Requests for assistance in delivering commodities to the system have been submitted.

Head of Aegis, Alba Tesreau, offered her gratitude to those involved in the fighting while Aegis directed AX efforts on the frontline with the two remaining Thargoid Titans.

The initiative will remain open for any remaining bounty voucher hand-ins. Participants will be able to collect their credit rewards from Rescue Ship Cornwallis in the V886 Centauri system once the initiative ends. Module rewards will be distributed automatically in due course.
