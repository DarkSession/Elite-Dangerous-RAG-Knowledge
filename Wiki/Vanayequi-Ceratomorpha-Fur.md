> Genetically regressive rhinoceroses were originally introduced to Vanayequi to provide a reliable source of leather for nearby industries. The genetic modification was successful in reducing the animal's aggressive tendencies, but had unintended side effects. As the ceratomorphs returned to a more primitive state, they began growing soft, lush fur. This fur is now prized around the galaxy for its resilience and warmth.
