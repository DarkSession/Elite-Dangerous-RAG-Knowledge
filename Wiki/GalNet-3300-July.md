    - - The rise of the Cobra and Eagle has been at the expense of Zorgon Peterson’s Hauler.

A concerned-looking spokesperson says ZP is unconcerned and believes the Hauler is ‘the perfect vessel for trading, which is such a fundamental activity within the galactic economy’.

    - **Piracy**

    - Abnormally high levels of piracy continue to be reported in LP 98-132.

- And Finally

    - Last weekend’s emergency meeting on Asellus Primus resulted in a product recall and a ban on the trading of Progenitor Cells. Progenitor Cells immediately became a mainstay of the black market economy.

    - Aulin has recalled a recent batch of Progenitor Cells while it investigates the reported contamination. Governments will convene again this weekend to review the findings of the investigations with a view to lifting the ban and re-starting production.

    - Leaked documents from the investigation suggest that the batch may have been intentionally contaminated and links are being made to left wing militants from Eranin. This would perhaps explain the splits in Eranin’s government and its rumoured intention to boycott the meeting at the weekend.

    - It remains to be seen if the investigation’s conclusion will allay the public’s fears over the possible side effects of this product.

- Elite Pilots Federation Alert

    - In four days time star ports will begin to offer a paint job service for Sidewinder and Eagle ships. Whilst these paint jobs don’t affect the performance of the vessels, we expect them to be popular and the galaxy to become a more colourful place.

    - Abnormally high levels of piracy continue to be reported in LP 98-132.

- And Finally

    - Progenitor Cells

    - The ban on the trading of Progenitor Cells was lifted after new batches were given the ‘all clear’ everywhere except Eranin. This depressed the black market, but Progenitor Cells have so far failed to regain their previous dominance of the trade markets as lingering public concern suppresses demand.

    - - Conflicting reports on social media include a statement attributed to a ‘Freedom Freda’ — believed to be a self-appointed spokesman for the rebels on Eranin, where she claims Progenitor Cells are used by «blood-sucking capitalist scum, unnaturally extending their lives to keep underpaid hard-working proletarians in their places».

    - - Progenitor Cell manufacturers are rumoured to be preparing legal action against the beleaguered Federal government in Eranin for lost profits, citing failure to control the Eranian left wing militants (‘terrorists’, as they are described in the draft claim we have seen) widely believed to be behind the initial contamination.

    - Fishy Goings On?

    - Market experts are left open-mouthed by this week’s fall in the popularity of fish. Top of the traded goods pile last week, this week fish have sunk to 4th place.
