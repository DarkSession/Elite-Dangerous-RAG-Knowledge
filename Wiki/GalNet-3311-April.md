### Gutamaya Joins Peers in New Spacecraft Boom

**Imperial socialites were treated to a tour of Gutamaya’s newest ship, the Corsair, at an extravagant launch on Capitol in Achenar.**

Gutamaya's event was attended by over a thousand prominent engineers, senators, press members and other notable individuals. Princess Aisling Duval and her cousin, Lucretia Roche-Duval, were the guests of honour.

Positive reviews of the Gutamaya Corsair’s public unveiling have been published in several outlets across the Empire already.

"*The Corsair’s specifications showed a promising mix of straight-line speed and large cargo capacity, making it ideal for traders who value efficient travel times*,” said Eugine Varrik of the Imperial Herald. “*The sleek design employs Gutamaya’s famous curves – attendees were queueing up with their blinks to take the perfect selfie*.”

“*What impressed me was the flexibility of the Corsair’s internal components*,” said Miyu Azusa for Eye on Achenar. “*With the right modules this vessel could adapt well to any pilot profession. All while enjoying a classic Imperial aesthetic, of course!*”

The Gutamaya Corsair is a medium-sized vessel, notable for being the first multipurpose Gutamaya ship which will be commercially available to pilots outside of the Imperial Navy.

### Political Flashpoint Sparks Violence in Chi Eridani

**Imperial agents have been blamed for an outbreak of combat in the Federally controlled Chi Eridani system.**

Several incidents have occurred between supporters of Shadow President Jerome Archer and Senator Denton Patreus of the Empire. The former group blames the latter for trying to subvert Federal governance of the system.

Vox Galactica spoke to a representative for Jerome Archer’s power base in Chi Eridani:

“*Recent interactions with these Imperial troublemakers have been challenging, to say the least. But we didn't expect them to flood the system in such large numbers! As such they should be treated as a hostile invading force. Patreus’s proxy squadrons must be driven out to solidify Jerome Archer’s position as the key figurehead of Chi Eridani*.”

Meanwhile, a representative of the Imperial agents also provided a statement:

“*Federal political complacency is to blame for growing calls for the Empire’s grace. Denton Patreus is a man of honour and discipline - traits the Federation often lacks. We simply intended to demonstrate how effective a strong inspiration can be, but came under attack from Archer’s mob. We have the right to defend ourselves*.”

Both factions have called for combat pilots to sign up to the ongoing conflict:

Jerome Archer supporters can register at Steve Masters starport.

Denton Patreus supporters can register at the Evanescent Dusk megaship.

### Gutamaya's Corsair Is Now Available for Early Delivery

**The initial production run of Gutamaya’s new Corsair ships has been deployed to much fanfare, with a flurry of adverts targeting early consumers.**

In a statement marking the occasion, Gutamaya's lead engineer Ines Allende remarked:

"*Today marks a significant milestone for Gutamaya. The Corsair blends our customary elegant design with exceptional multipurpose capability, fulfilling the diverse demands of modern pilots*."

“*With a balanced hardpoint configuration, substantial cargo capacity, powerful thrusters and four utility slots, this vessel adapts beautifully for trading, combat, and exploration roles*.”

The Corsair is Gutamaya’s first commercially available multirole ship which forgoes any Imperial Navy rank requirement. It offers versatility in a medium-sized ship classification, making it viable for trading with outposts inaccessible to larger Imperial vessels.

Princess Aisling Duval, present at Gutamaya’s launch event in Capitol, expressed satisfaction with the Corsair's reception: "*This magnificent ship represents the Empire's commitment to innovation, while honoring our people’s aesthetic tastes. I am in awe of Gutamaya’s continued dedication to excellence and will be adding a Corsair to my personal fleet*."

The Corsair is available for exclusive purchase initially and will transition to standard shipyard inventories at a later date.

### Increased Security Needed in Dhan System

**\*Pilots’ Federation Alert\***

The governing faction of the Dhan system has called for support in fending off a spike in local piracy.

Harald Gomes, head of security for the Dhan Empire League, spoke to local reporters:

“*It’s becoming obvious that pirates are growing bolder in recent weeks. We’ve received alarming frequent reports of attacks and looting throughout our system’s many planetary rings – icy rings in particular. Our security forces are overwhelmed, and the Imperial navy is occupied in other areas. So, we’re asking for help*.”

While piracy hotspots are not unusual, the situation in Dhan has drawn interest due to rumours that Gutamaya analysts have arrived in the system to track the performance of any newly released Corsair vessels used in the fighting.

Dhan Empire League has offered extra rewards to independent combat pilots willing to eliminate criminals and collect bounties in Dhan, after registering at Kidd Station in advance.

### Heavy Combat in Chi Eridani Subsides

**A proxy conflict between supporters of Jerome Archer and Denton Patreus appears to be slowing down after several days of sustained fighting.**

Battlefield reporters for the Chi Eridani Herald state that the Jerome Archer group emerged victorious, scoring a higher number of confirmed victories in the area.

A spokesperson for Jerome Archer provided the following to the Herald:

“*It's obvious that this outcome proves the strong influence and military might of Jerome Archer’s supporters in Chi Eridani. Hopefully this leads to a widespread acceptance of the benefits and protection that Archer’s leadership can bring to the system*.”

Those who took part in the conflict for either side can now collect their rewards.

Jerome Archer supporters can collect their rewards at Steve Masters starport.

Denton Patreus supporters can collect their rewards at the Evanescent Dusk megaship.

### Cobra Mk V Enters Full Production

**Faulcon DeLacy has confirmed that its Cobra Mk V has entered full production, with deliveries commencing to shipyards across the core systems.**

Previously offered via limited release, the Cobra Mk V is the latest evolution of the iconic Cobra line, long favoured by pilots seeking versatility in a compact frame. With improved handling, modularity, and a focus on enhanced compatibility with SCO enabled frame shift drives, the Mk V builds on the reputation of its predecessors with an eye toward modern multipurpose performance.

Faulcon DeLacy’s Chief Financial Officer, Taron Raines, offered the following remarks:

"*This vessel represents a perfect balance of capability and affordability. The engineering team has created something truly special that honours the legacy of one of the most popular ship designs in history*."

“*With a nimble profile and excellent performance relative to its size and cost, the Mk V boasts an adaptability that makes it well-suited for pilots at all stages of their careers*.”

The Cobra Mk V is now widely available across the core systems. Interested commanders are advised to contact shipyards in systems with a high-tech economy.

### Secure Resource Sites Declared in Dhan

**Independent pilots have helped eradicate large numbers of pirates in the Dhan system.**

Following an unusually high increase in piracy across the system’s many planetary rings, local security fleets and skilled freelancers worked to eliminate pirates and show criminals that it would be better for them to relocate.

“*Pirates are too foolish to give up a life on the wrong side of the law*,” said Dhan Empire League head of security Harald Gomes. “*It’s all they know, and all they’re good for. But while we can’t stamp out crime forever, we can at least send the message that Dhan isn’t an easy target. Attack our mining craft at your peril, ya lugheads!*”

Gutamaya, thought to have deployed observers to monitor use of its recently released Corsair craft during the conflict, is said to have been ‘very impressed’ by its craft’s performance and the anti-piracy response force in general.

Participants that registered for the conflict can collect their rewards from Kidd Station.

### Powerplay Standings: April 3311

**This month’s analysis of the influence held by key figures in the core systems has arrived, courtesy of Conrad Sterling of Vox Galactica.**

His latest survey of system populations suggests the following five powers enjoy the largest sphere of influence:

Rank 1: Edmund Mahon – 1,461 systems

Rank 2: Aisling Duval - 1,436 systems

Rank 3: Arissa Lavigny-Duval – 1,366 systems

Rank 4: Yuri Grom – 1,041 systems

Rank 5: Li Yong-Rui – 860 systems

The largest increase in system influence belonged to Li Yong-Rui who can claim an additional 59 systems as supporters.

Vox Galactica will provide another update on the state of the powers next month.

### Migration and Economic Boom in Newly Colonised Systems

**Migrants are flocking from the core systems to begin new lives in the thousands of recently established colonies.**

A wave of independent colonisation efforts over the past few months have increased human territory considerably. While many of these star systems have been classified as ‘waypoints’, with singular docking outposts for journeys between systems with wider infrastructure, a significant number have been expanded with multiple starports and settlements.

It is these that billions of people are now heading towards in the hope of starting fresh. Workers and their families are starting to arrive in large numbers, bringing with them a major boost to economic output.

With the influx of population, the new colonies will be more capable of producing their own colonisation-related commodities, with economies now driven by linking installations and markets placed throughout the system. Analysts believe that, over time, this ability to self-sustain expansion efforts will prove vital if the colonies are to be successful in the long term.

Professor Irene Ralston, head of political history at Olympus Village University, wrote for the Federal Times:

“*It is fair to say that, in terms of scale, this is the largest migration event in human history. This migration appears to be fuelled by a hope for a new chapter — the chance to become part of a ‘new frontier’. No doubt the upheaval of the recent Thargoid invasion had some influence in the decision making, but the sheer numbers involved are fascinating*.”

It is expected that, when economies and populations begin to settle, Brewer Corporation’s Trailblazer fleet of megaships which currently supply many colonies will be repurposed for other duties.

Brewer Corporation also revealed that it has prepared a variety of custom layouts and decorative suites, allowing architects to visually tailor their new constructions. This latest innovation from the industrial giant is available for deployment from today.
