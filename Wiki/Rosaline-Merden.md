## Timeline

22 OCT 3302

- Board members of MetaDrive Inc. today announced the sale of MetaDrive Inc. to the Sirius Corporation. Rosaline Merden, acting Chair of MetaDrive, was clearly pleased with the outcome. At a press conference, she said: "The board of MetaDrive wholeheartedly welcomes the security this acquisition brings. As part of the Sirius Corporation, the MetaDrive brand will continue to go from strength to strength." Reporters asked about the ongoing audit of MetaDrive, and also the fate of former employee Raan Corsen, who was reported missing a couple of weeks ago. "The audit has been successfully completed and all assets are in the hands of Sirius Corporation," said Merden. "Raan Corsen's employment was terminated prior to the takeover." Merden was challenged by a representative of the Earth Defence Fleet, who alleged that Raan Corsen had in fact fled from Sirius security forces and been killed in the Alioth system. "Mr Corsen's business in the Alioth system was his own," said Merden. "It has nothing to do with the Sirius Corporation." The press conference closed with outstanding questions, but reporters managed to get a final word from Commander MoonWeb of the Earth Defence Fleet. "According to our intel, Corsen was pursued before crash-landing on a planet in the Alioth system. This was observed by Commander Ashley Wilkinson, a Canonn representative working with the Earth Defence Fleet. The specifics surrounding Corsen's demise are not known, but we have a transcript of his final transmission that points a finger squarely at the Sirius Corporation."^[1]^

23 SEP 3302

- Sad news from the Chi Orionis system this morning with reports that Femi Dakarai, chairman of the hyperdrive-research company MetaDrive Inc., has passed away following a short illness. Dakarai was taken ill last week after working tirelessly to secure financial backing for the company. Board members reported that he was working long hours and had been showing signs of stress for several months. An assessment of MetaDrive Inc. by an independent auditing firm appears to have been the final straw. "We should have acted sooner, but we were working extremely hard," said Rosaline Merden, company secretary. "With the company set to deliver on some very exciting technology in the coming year, it's particularly tragic. We will carry on in his memory." Board members were quick to pay their respects, and according to unofficial sources have made a generous payment to the Dakarai family on behalf of MetaDrive Inc. In related news, Raan Corsen, a junior employee of MetaDrive Inc., was recently suspended from the company after auditors detected account irregularities. Security forces in the Chi Orionis system, recently brought under the control of the Earth Defense Fleet, have asked the public to report any sightings of Corsen. MetaDrive Inc. has become something of a poster child for the depression currently affecting stock markets. Economic forecasts remain gloomy, with little prospect of improvement on the horizon.^[2]^
