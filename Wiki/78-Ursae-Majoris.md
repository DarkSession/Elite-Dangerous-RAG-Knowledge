## Timeline

31 MAY 3301

- President of the Federation Jasmina Halsey's ship had gone missing and she was presumed dead, meaning she would no longer be visiting 78 Ursae Majoris. Alioth Independents' security and military campaigns against the Sobek Boys had been a success however, and Andrew Bailey, Mayor of Townshend Hub, celebrated by temporarily discounting Shield Generators.^[1]^

09 MAY 3301

- The citizens of 78 Ursae Majoris expressed their opinions - ranging from contempt to indifference - on the odd news of President Halsey's intended visit, after the system was neglected for years under Federation rule.

> 
> 
> I thought the Lughnatics murdered Halsey? She’s coming ’ere, you say? Why? I thought we were pretty clear, !\*#@ the Feds, we don’t want ’em. Well... ’ere’s ’oping no one gets any bright ideas about finishing ’er off, this place was just finally startin’ ta sort itself out.

17 MAR 3301

- Rebels - the 78 Ursae Majoris Blue Boys - declared war on the Federation in 78 Ursae Majoris.

> 
> 
> Pah! The Federation! Now, I won't say I support this war, the revolutionaries are monsters and criminals, but the inability of the local Federal government to keep things under control is exactly why those folks are so unpopular here! The Feds are too busy playing with Lughnatics and Onionheads half a galaxy to focus on places like this - maybe both sides will kill each other off, I can't help but think we'd be better off for it.
