## Timeline

01 OCT 3306

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders\*
New starports constructed in ten systems causing increased commodity demand.
Several refinery outposts have now been upgraded to starports, following an initiative to improve access to large ships for refuelling fleet carriers. Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd has completed construction of the following Orbis starports:
Harper Plant in the Fjorgyn system
Iqbal Hub in the HR 4979 system
Stephenson Dock in the Wolf 294 system
McQuarrie Landing in the Lambda-2 Tucanae system
Hartsfield Plant in the Potriti system
The following Coriolis starports have been constructed by Steel Castle Inc:
Rorschach Hub in the LHS 4058 system
Chargaff Installation in the Chakpa system
Nagata Vision in the Gally Bese system
Reilly Plant in the Eta Cephei system
Trevithick Vision in the Ninabin system
As a result of the community drives to build these starports, there have been fluctuations on the trading market. The availability of several commodities has been reduced, resulting in increased prices and profit margins. The items affected include:
Bauxite
Building fabricators
Gallite
Power generators
Rutile
Thermal cooling units^[1]^

21 SEP 3306

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders\*
New starports to be constructed in 10 systems.
Two projects to resource the upgrading of refinery outposts into starports have concluded. The aim is to increase efficiency for fleet carrier owners who use large ships for transporting tritium fuel. Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd published this statement from CEO Susannah Haynes: "Thanks to a generous number of deliveries, we will have in place fully functioning Orbis starports for the start of October in the Fjorgyn, HR 4979, Wolf 294, Lambda-2 Tucanae and Potriti systems. All participating traders can now collect their rewards at Blaauw Hub in the Tenche system." A similar announcement came from Dean Bradigan, director of Steel Castle Inc: "The many shipments that we received will enable us to provide new Coriolis stations in the LHS 4058, Chakpa, Gally Bese, Eta Cephei and Ninabin systems by the beginning of October. We hope these will provide services to travellers for many years to come. Rewards for all pilots who delivered these minerals are now available at Teng-hui Station in the Nagasairu system."^[2]^

17 SEP 3306

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT: For the attention of all Commanders\*
Trading commodities required in Nagasairu and Tenche systems.
Two construction companies have requested materials to convert refinery outposts into starports, to assist owners of fleet carriers who use large vessels for tritium refuelling. Susannah Haynes, CEO of Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd, stated: "With the galactic community's help, we can upgrade a maximum of five outposts into Orbis starports. Our intermediaries, Tenche Universal Holdings, will accept deliveries of building fabricators, power generators and thermal cooling units at Blaauw Hub in the Tenche system." There were similar requests from Dean Bradigan, director of Steel Castle Inc: "For travellers who find the familiar sight of Coriolis stations welcoming, here's a chance to build up to five more. We ask for shipments of bauxite, gallite and rutile to be delivered to CQC Holdings at Teng-hui Station in the Nagasairu system." The number of starports will depend on the amount of materials delivered. The target systems in order of priority are Fjorgyn, HR 4979, Wolf 294, Lambda-2 Tucanae, Potriti, LHS 4058, Chakpa, Gally Bese, Eta Cephei and Ninabin. If successful, upgrading will be done for the start of October. Both initiatives begin on 17th September 3306 and will run for one week. If the final targets for a campaign are met earlier than planned, it will end immediately.^[3]^

11 SEP 3306

- A press release from Brewer Corporation discusses plans to improve access to refuelling for owners of fleet carriers. "We have been surprised and gratified by the popularity of our latest product. The options for independent pilots and crews have been considerably expanded by the versatility and capability of our Drake-Class Carriers. But we have also listened to customers' concerns, in particular that large ships such as Anacondas, Corvettes and Clippers cannot dock with refinery outposts to take on Tritium fuel. To help alleviate this issue, Brewer Corporation has partnered with two independent construction firms: Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd and Steel Castle Inc. They are tasked with upgrading a number of outposts into fully functioning starports, in order to make refuelling runs more efficient." The two construction companies that won this contract both have impressive track records in modifying orbital habitats. Kavanagh Spaceframes specialises in Orbis starports, while Steel Castle exclusively works with Coriolis designs. The projects are expected to begin next week.^[4]^
