The **Remote Release Flak Launcher** is a remote release launcher hardpoint created by Aegis. Released on October 12, 3303, the Remote Release Flak Launcher is specifically designed as a countermeasure against the Thargon Swarms released by Thargoid Interceptors, and is ineffective against other targets. It can be purchased at military, high-tech, and industrial Surface Ports.

It is also of substantial use in farming raw materials, as the flak can knock off outcrops en masse for collector limpets to collect.
