# Shielded Module
- *For similar modifications applied to other modules, see Shielded Frame Shift Drive and Shielded Power Distributor.*

**Shielded Module** is an engineer modification that can be applied to some modules. It is similar to the Reinforced modification in that it increases module integrity, but at the cost of increased power draw rather than mass.

It is available in 5 grades, with the highest grade offering up to 300% increase in module integrity.
