# Profile Analyser
Profile Analyser
 		 	 

The **Profile Analyser** is an On Foot tool with two modes: Scan Mode, and Profile Cloning Mode. Scan Mode scans a target for basic personal information. Profile Cloning Mode illegally clones a target's security authorisation profile at a settlement.^[1]^ It can be equipped with the Flight Suit, Maverick Suit, Dominator Suit, and Artemis Suit. It was introduced in *ED: Odyssey*.

## Usage

The Profile Analyser is used to identify specific settlement personnel, as well as any Goods they may be carrying and their security authorisation level, with its Scan Mode. Living and deceased individuals alike can be scanned to acquire any bounties they may have for redemption. Living individuals scanned in this way will always notice the scan occurring, and individuals with bounties will immediately become hostile upon the scan's completion. In Anarchy settlements, other personnel within the settlement will not become hostile toward the NPC with the bounty, and will instead attack the player (if within range) similarly to any other instance of communicable NPC hostility.

The device's secondary function, Profile Cloning Mode, can digitally clone a target's security authorisation, which can then be used to gain access to otherwise restricted settlement facilities. Using Profile Cloning Mode is an illegal action, and will trigger settlement security and a fine if caught. A cloned profile is stored in the user's inventory, and can be discarded manually through the InSight Hub or instantly via the "Clear Authority Level" keybind.

Settlement personnel assigned to guard duty carry Profile Analysers to scan visitors. Commanders must submit to a scan upon request, or else they will trigger the settlement's security response and will be shot on sight. Even if Commanders clone a profile without being caught, a security scan by personnel will recognize it as stolen and trigger settlement security.
