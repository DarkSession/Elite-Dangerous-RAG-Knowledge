Vice Chancellor of Orion University

**Leland Pettigrew** is the Vice Chancellor of Orion University. In October 3307, he asserted the university's legal ownership of The Scriveners Clan Dredger based on newfound historical records, and oversaw a search effort together with Earle Pittman of Deep Space Mining that successfully located the vessel in Oochost PC-C c29-0. In November 3307, after Orion University found itself in a standoff with the Scriveners Clan over rights to the dredger, Pettigrew attempted to earn the clan's trust by overseeing the collection of multiple types of data to donate to their Knowledge Core as a gesture of goodwill. This campaign was defeated by a competing one that secured enough resources for the Scriveners to repair their dredger and bypass the override codes the university had been using to prevent the vessel from jumping away.

## Timeline

25 NOV 3307

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
The Scriveners Clan dredger has been fully repaired, following twin initiatives in the HIP 43670 system. A campaign by supporters of the Scriveners Clan delivered emergency power cells, power converters and power transfer buses to the Alliance of HIP 42371 at Oramus Terminal. A spokesperson for the group announced: "As a result of our efforts, the dredger has received sufficient supplies to effect repairs. Most importantly, the new power systems mean it will shortly be able to bypass Orion University's override codes and be free to travel the galaxy once more." A parallel campaign by Orion University's partner Independent HIP 43670 Labour requested deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data, unusual encrypted files and unidentified scan archives to Shaara Gateway in HIP 43670. However, these were not sufficient to convince the nomadic tribe to agree to its offer of sharing future discoveries. Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew expressed his regret, but confirmed that Orion University will honour the outcome and withdraw its claim over the dredger. Contributors to both initiatives can now collect their rewards from Shaara Gateway or Oramus Terminal in the HIP 43670 system.^[1]^

18 NOV 3307

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
The HIP 43670 system is hosting two competing delivery initiatives, each of which aims to benefit the Scriveners Clan. Orion University has partnered with Independent HIP 43670 Labour, which is requesting deliveries of anomalous bulk scan data, unusual encrypted files and unidentified scan archives to Shaara Gateway in HIP 43670. The university's campaign was explained by Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew: "Although Dredger J-403 is legally our property, what we value most is the Scriveners Clan's dedication to deep-space research. To convince them of our noble intentions, we are donating scientific data and samples to their Knowledge Core. Our proposal is that they permit us to accompany them on their journey and share in any future discoveries." An alternative campaign is also taking place in the HIP 43670 system. Supporters of the Scriveners Clan are being asked to gather emergency power cells, power converters and power transfer buses and deliver them to the Alliance of HIP 42371 at Oramus Terminal. A spokesperson told the media: "These supplies are needed to perform vital repairs to the dredger. Furthermore, if the power systems are sufficiently updated, they can bypass the ancient components affected by Orion University's override codes and continue travelling independently." Although there remains no response from the Scriveners Clan, the dredger is now actively monitoring all local and interstellar transmissions. This is a new development for the isolated community, and suggests they are aware of these campaigns.^[2]^

18 OCT 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
The dredger inhabited by the nomadic Scriveners Clan has been found within the Oochost PC-C c29-0 system. Independent pilots conducted a search for the vessel in response to a request from Orion University, which claims that the Dredger-class bulk cruiser is its commercial property. Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew announced the operation's success: "Congratulations to the pilots who managed to locate Dredger J-403. The university will shortly dispatch a megaship to take ownership and arrange repatriation for its current occupants." The dredger is currently orbiting an ice world in the Oochost PC-C c29-0 system. It is believed to be collecting raw material from planetary rings to sustain its onboard systems, a design feature that allows it to remain self-sufficient indefinitely. There has been no communication with the Scriveners Clan, the spacefaring tribe descended from an academic institute that was later absorbed into Orion University. It is known that they shun contact with all outsiders to protect their Knowledge Core, a repository of research conducted over the past two centuries.^[3]^

14 OCT 3307

- \*Pilots Federation ALERT\*
Rewards are being offered by Orion University to locate the Scriveners Clan dredger, which it claims as its legal property. The self-sustaining Dredger-class bulk cruiser was launched two centuries ago by an academic institute that was later absorbed by the university. Since then the dredger has become the home for a nomadic tribe called the Scriveners Clan, which refuses contact with all outsiders. Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew told the media: "Orion University is willing to reward pilots who can pinpoint the dredger's current location. We believe it is still within 500 light years of the Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system. Pilots who are interested in helping should first dock at Ring Mine station in the 2MASS J03291977+3124572 system, to automatically sign up to the search operation. Our associates at the starport, Deep Space Mining, will provide further information including details of the reward."^[4]^

13 OCT 3307

- The ancient spacefaring home of the Scriveners Clan is the legal property of Orion University, according to newfound historical records. The Scriveners Clan is a nomadic tribe travelling onboard a self-sufficient Dredger-class bulk cruiser. Their society is descended from an academic organisation that sent out a research fleet two centuries ago. Unlike some dredger clans, they refuse to have any contact with outsiders. Vice Chancellor Leland Pettigrew of Orion University made this statement: "In the year 3088, Dredger J-403 was commissioned for an exploration mission by an academic institute named Scrivener College. This was absorbed into our university in 3125. Documents detailing these facts were recently discovered in our archives and verified by the courts. Therefore the dredger, including all of its contents, is legally owned by Orion University. Naturally we bear no ill will toward its current populace, but the vessel they inhabit has always been our commercial property." The Scriveners Clan dredger was last seen in the Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 system, where it was salvaging the Hesperus megaship. On the 9th of July it made a hyperspace jump to an unknown destination within 500 light years. Orion University is the largest independent educational institution in the core systems, rivalled only by the Imperial Science Academy and Olympus Village University.^[5]^
