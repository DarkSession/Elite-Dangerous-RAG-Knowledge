# Fast Charge

**Fast Charge** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to Shield Generators through Engineering. It boosts shield regeneration rate while shields are active, but reduces the shields' resistance to damage.

## Effects

| Statistic | Change | +ve/-ve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Broken Regen Rate | 15% | + |
| Kinetic Resistance | -1% | - |
| Thermal Resistance | -2% | - |
| Explosive Resistance | -1% | - |
| Regen Rate | 15% | + |

## Applicability

The effect is available for the following modules:

- Shield Generators:
    - Standard Shield Generator
    - Prismatic Shield Generator
    - Bi-Weave Shield Generator

## Required Materials

- 5x Worn Shield Emitters
- 3x Flawed Focus Crystals
- 1x Compound Shielding
