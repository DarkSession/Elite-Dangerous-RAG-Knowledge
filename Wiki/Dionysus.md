**Dionysus** is a Flight Operations Carrier Megaship located in the HIP 17044 system. It was constructed following a Community Goal overseen by the player minor faction Sirius Inc. Original plans called for the Dionysus to be stationed in the 42 n Persei system, but after further debate within Sirius Inc, the location was changed to HIP 17044 shortly before the vessel was unveiled.^[1]^^[2]^
