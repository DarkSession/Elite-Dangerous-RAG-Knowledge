# Faster Boot Sequence Frame Shift Drive
**Faster Boot Sequence Frame Shift Drive** is an Engineer modification that can be applied to Frame Shift Drives. It decreases the time taken for the drive to come back online after being deactivated. It also offers a small increase in range, at the cost of increased Thermal Load and decreased module integrity. 

It is available in 5 grades, with the highest grade offering up to 80% decrease in boot time.

Note that "boot time" is not to be confused with FSD charging time, which is the amount of time needed to charge the FSD in order to perform a jump to supercruise or hyperspace. This modification does not reduce FSD charging time, nor does it reduce the safety cooldown after leaving supercruise or hyperspace.

This modification is suitable if the pilot desires to set their Frame Shift Driver to a low power priority. It also reduces the duration of an FSD reboot caused by weapons such as Containment Missiles, FSD Interrupt missiles, or Shift-Lock Canister Mine Launchers.
