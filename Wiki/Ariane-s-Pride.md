**Ariane's Pride** is a Type-9 Heavy shipwreck on planet 3 A in the HIP 32001 system. It belonged to Commander Ariane Key, and was downed by a rogue comet while travelling to the Cerritics system on a trading run. CMDR Key survived the crash and was soon rescued by a passing ship, which transported her to Gooch Hangar in Baliscii. CMDR Sean Bannon later discovered the shipwreck via a transmission picked up by a Listening Post in Cerritics.^[1]^

<br>I can't believe I survived, the ship is totalled and there is no way I'm getting off this rock without help.<br><br><br>Communications are sketchy at best and I don't even know if this is getting out. The ship scanners did show some ships in my sector befor they died.<br><br><br>Hopefully one of them will pick this up and come get me.<br> |

<br>I had lost hope, thought I was never getting out of here. But then I heard the landing thrusters.<br><br><br>Someone picked up my signal and I have to say an Asp has never looked so welcome.<br><br><br>This was a close call and I thank my lucky stars that the Winters Grasp and her commander were not a pirate ship looking to pick my bones.<br><br><br>I've rescued what I can of my personal belongings, the insurance will cover the rest. We're heading to Gooch Hangar in Baliscii, where with luck I'll be able to get a transport home.<br> |
