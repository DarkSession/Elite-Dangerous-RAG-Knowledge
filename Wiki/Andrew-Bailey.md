## Timeline

31 MAY 3301

- President of the Federation Jasmina Halsey's ship had gone missing and she was presumed dead, meaning she would no longer be visiting 78 Ursae Majoris. Alioth Independents' security and military campaigns against the Sobek Boys had been a success, however, and Andrew Bailey, Mayor of Townshend Hub celebrated by temporarily discounting Shield Generators.^[1]^
