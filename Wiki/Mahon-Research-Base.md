**Mahon Research Base** is the third deep space research facility founded by the Alliance-affiliated Mic Turner Research Group, and the fourth Planetary Outpost to emerge in and around the California Nebula, since the start of 3303. 

Located on the third moon of a ringed Class Y dwarf star in HIP 18077, the base offers the standard array of general services, including a commodities market, mission and passenger boards, stellar cartographer, and crew lounge. It is also one of the few facilities in the sector equipped bays for outfitting ships with a modest range of weapons and modules.^[1]^

Mahon Research Base was built to study an adjacent patch of fungal growth with massive rounded bodies similar to gourds or pumpkins, which have since been named Anemones.^[2]^
