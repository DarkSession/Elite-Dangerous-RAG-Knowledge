## History

About 4.5 billion years ago, the Moon was created when a Mars sized planet hit the Earth, and sent fragments off into space. Then a meteor that impacted the Moon’s surface created dark spots on its surface. Most asteroids and comets bombard the Moon’s surface, causing craters to form.

It was the first non-Earth body where Humans landed and walked on July 20, 1969.

The NASA spaceflight Apollo 11 landed the first two humans on the Moon. Mission commander Neil Armstrong and pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the lunar module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 UTC.
