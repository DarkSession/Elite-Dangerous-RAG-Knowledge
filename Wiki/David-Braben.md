David Braben is a leading figure in the computer games industry, one of the most influential computer game programmers of all time^[6]^ and a radical innovator in game design. The sprawling open-world game-play and classic science-fiction setting of Elite made it a cult hit in the 1980s. He also made Frontier: Elite II in 1993, Frontier: First Encounters in 1995 and is the director of Elite: Dangerous since 2014. The success of the original Elite helped to create the UK games industry, which now has an annual turnover of £3 billion (2015).^[5]^

In May 2011, David Braben announced a new prototype computer, Raspberry Pi, mounted on a printed-circuit board not much bigger than a credit card, and intended to stimulate the teaching of basic computer science in schools. Since then, more than 5,000,000 Raspberry Pis have been sold. The initiative came from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. The charity, of which David Braben is a trustee, aims to promote the study of computer science and to put the fun back into learning computing.^[5]^
