## History

The non-descriptive system designated Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 came to humanity's attention after Jaques Station arrived there in May 3302.

### Jaques Station

Jaques Station was the only space station equipped for continuous star travel. After a successful community goal to provide the station with fuel it attempted an extreme long-range jump from Gliese 1269 to Beagle Point  on 21 May 3302. The station was forced off-course by severe technical failures caused by a contraband cache of Thargoid Sensors (Unknown Artefact interference). The station's drives malfunctioned during the jump and it stranded in Eol Prou RS-T d3-94. Jaques Station was miraculously located on 29 June 3302. It was restored to partial functionality within a week thanks to a massive emergency aid convoy assembled by independent pilots. This community goal to provide Jaques Station with repair materials succeeded, but Jaques had no plans to retry the jump to Beagle Point.

### Settlement

The first permanent settlement in the system, Colonia Hub was constructed on the surface of Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 2 a (now known as Colonia 2 a), and inaugurated on September 9, 3302. It became the headquarters of the Colonia Council. It was the global reward for a community goal. This marked the beginning of human colonization of the Colonia Nebula and wider Colonia Region. Colonia also contains Holloway Biology Centre, the headquarters of the Holloway Bioscience Institute.

## Naming

## Population

Colonia's population has grown rapidly since Jaques Station was rediscovered. It was originally only 750 during most of 3302, consisting of the crew of the station itself. Since then, the system's population has been recorded as expanding to 60,000 by early 3303, 200,000 by June 24, 3303, 400,000 by September 26, 3303, 450,000 by January 11, 3304, and 583,869 by May 20, 3307. GalNet has reported on Colonia's population boom.^[1]^

## Travel to Colonia

The Colonia system is exactly 22,000.46 ly away from Sol. To facilitate travel and trade between the Core Systems and Colonia, a network of 17 inhabited systems with 20 ports was constructed between them, forming the Colonia Connection Highway. Neutron stars in the Neutron Highway along the route can be fuel scooped for FSD Supercharging, reducing overall travel times significantly.
