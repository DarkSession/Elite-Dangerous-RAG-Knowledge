**Kracer** was an admiral of the Federal Navy. In 2854, he led a Federal fleet and liberated New California in Alioth from Imperial occupation at the request of the Cakers, who sought the Federation's help in preventing the Empire from imposing a genetic correction programme on the planet's population. For their timely intervention, Kracer and his marines were hailed as heroes by the locals. He retired from military service in 2857, settled on New California, and became the colony's leader.^[1]^
