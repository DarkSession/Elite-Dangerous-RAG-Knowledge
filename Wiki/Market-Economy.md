# Market Economy
Commodities Market Guide
 		 	 

Star systems have a different government, local laws, and **market economy**.

The market economies are dynamic, affected by the trade of other commanders, NPCs and events that occur in the system. Every station has its own supply and demand that change dynamically. Stations with a commodities market allows you to buy and sell commodities from the local market.^[1]^

Both regular player activity, such as trading or piracy, and special missions will affect how the ruling faction of the system develops overtime. Such activities influence the evolution of the galaxy which is handled by the Background Simulation. 

Anyone can trade with some starting credits. The core is a simple, fundamental truth: buy low and sell high. As a trader you will need to carefully study market economies in the systems you pass through. Changing states and events in systems can affect commodity prices.^[1]^ 

Commodities are cheaper when they are common. To make a profit, sell it in systems where it's less common with higher prices. The rarer a commodity the more valuable it'll be. Supply and demand drive prices, and every trade you make in the galaxy affects the markets for every player.^[2]^

## Market Economy Types

In the Galaxy Map, the Info Tab displays basic known information about the system, such as the star type, controlling government type, market economies present and population.

There are eight **market economy** types. Systems with different economy types have different supply and demand for commodities. Some systems have a mix of different economies. A higher population usually means higher supply and demand thus you can trade longer without breaking a trade route.

### Extraction

- Imports - Consumer Items, Food, explosives (chemicals), mineral extractors (machinery), H.E. Suits (technology), basic medicines (medicines)
- Exports - Minerals group, some Metals group, hydrogen fuels (chemical group)

### Refinery

- Imports - Consumer Items, Food, Minerals, Microbial Furnaces (machinery), H.E. Suits (technology)
- Exports - Metals, Industrial Materials, hydrogen fuels (chemical)

### Industrial

- Imports - Food, Metals, auto fabricators & robotics (technology)
- Exports - Machinery, Consumer Items, food cartridges (food), computer components (technology), scrap (waste)

### High Tech

- Imports - Food, Machinery, Metals, superconductors (industrial materials)
- Exports - Technology, consumer tech (consumer items)

### Agriculture

- Imports - Consumer Items, crop harvesters (machinery), agri medicines (medicines), pesticides (chemicals), biowaste (waste) [most other systems export this, it's cheap & plentiful]
- Exports - Food, Textiles

### Terraforming

- Imports - high demand for general goods.
- Exports - Hydrogen fuel, biowaste

### Tourism

- Imports - high demand for general goods.
- Exports - Hydrogen fuel, biowaste

### Service

- Imports - various goods
- Exports - a service economy does not produce items for consumption.

### Military

- Imports - Aluminum, H.E. Suits, Polymers, Thorium, Titanium
- Exports - Hydrogen Fuel, Scrap, Robotics, Advanced Catalysers, Non-Lethal Weapons

### Colony

- Imports - Cobalt, Rutile, Pyrophyllite, Clothing, Grain, Surface Stabilisers, Water Purifiers, Thermal Cooling Units, Power Generators
- Exports - Hydrogen Fuel, Biowaste, Limpet

### Rescue

Only Rescue Vessels have this economy type.

- Imports - Liquid Oxygen, Water, Evacuation Shelter, Basic Medicines, H.E. Suits, Natural Fabrics
- Exports - A Rescue economy does not produce any items

### Damaged

Only Damaged Stations have this economy type.

- Imports - Liquid Oxygen, Water, Evacuation Shelter, Basic Medicines, H.E. Suits, Natural Fabrics
- Exports - A Damaged economy does not produce any items

### Repair

Only Repairing Stations have this economy type.

- Imports - Auto-Fabricators, Robotics, Polymers, Palladium, Lithium, Rutile, Conductive Fabrics
- Exports - Hydrogen Fuel

### Private Enterprise

Only Drake-Class Carriers have this economy type. These privately-owned vessels do not generate commodities for export or request commodities for import on their own. Their owners can place potentially lucrative purchase orders for specific commodities that visiting pilots can fulfill, and also set tariffs on commodity purchases and sales.

## Tips

- Keep notes. At your first system see what's in high demand to be sold into the system, then travel off, and use those notes to decide what to buy and bring back.
- Ignore what the Mission Board tells you is 'hot' right now. That doesn't bear much relation to the system's economy type, and covers commodities not yet available (e.g. 'wood' requested  that's not available to buy/trade).

## Production Chains

Each economy supports each other with their commodities. Knowing where each commodity lies in the production chains is a good way to figure out what goes where, increasing your profits and allowing you to better immerse yourself in the game's world.

The first part of a typical chain is usually Extraction, which mines raw materials. These are then taken to Refinery, which refines the materials into metals. These metals are taken to either Industrial or High Tech. Industrial uses these metals to produce machinery for High Tech and Agriculture. High Tech creates technology and electronics for Agriculture, Colony, Terraforming, Damaged, Repair, and Service, as well as medicines for all economies, and Agriculture produces food for all economies.
