The **Enhanced AX Multi-cannon** is a variant of the AX Multi-cannon created by Aegis. Turreted, Fixed and Gimballed variants were introduced in various Community Goals during the Second Thargoid war, respectively on 07 Dec. 3308, 14 Dec. 3308 and 27 Dec. 3308. They offer slightly increased damage and significantly improved projectile speed in exchange of virtually no drawback compared to their respective regular variant. All Enhanced AX Multi-cannons are available in both Class 2 and Class 3 versions, and can be purchased for credits at the outfitting of Rescue Megaships.

Similarly to the regular variant, the Enhanced AX Multi-cannon is designed primarily for combat against Thargoid ships, and consequently deals less damage against conventional human ships than a standard Multi-cannon.

**Class 2 (gimballed):**

- 9 Iron
- 11 Zirconium
- 6 Bio-mechanical Conduits
- 7 Wreckage components
- 14 Weapon parts

**Class 3 (gimballed):**

- 11 Iron
- 16 Zirconium
- 6 Ship systems data
- 9 Bio-mechanical conduits
- 12 Wreckage components
- 17 Weapon parts

Compared to the regular Enhanced variant, the Azimuth-modified module offers +10% damage and the Auto Loader experimental mod, at the cost of +75% power draw and +300% thermal load.
