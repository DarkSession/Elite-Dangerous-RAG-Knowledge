# Damage Falloff
**Damage Falloff** is a characteristic of all kinetic or thermal weapons in *Elite Dangerous* that reduces the damage of shots once they exceed a certain range. The Damage Falloff effect is linear: a weapon's shot does full damage up to the point that Damage Falloff begins, zero damage at the maximum limit of its range, and half damage at the midpoint between those two thresholds.

A weapon's effective range can be altered by Engineer modifications. Focused Weapon increases maximum range, Long Range Weapon increases maximum range *and* falloff starting point such that the weapon experiences no falloff at all, and Short Range Weapon decreases range (but not falloff starting point).
