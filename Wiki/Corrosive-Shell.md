**Corrosive Shell** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to a weapon through Engineering. It consists of experimental rounds that temporarily weaken Armour Hardness and increase all damage taken, at the cost of a 20% reduction in ammo capacity. While the effect is active, incoming damage from all sources is increased by 25%, and all attacks receive a +20 bonus to their armour piercing value.^[1]^

The effects of Corrosive Shell do not stack on a single target, and therefore it is most efficient and cost-effective to only apply it to one weapon per ship. Furthermore, the type and size of the chosen weapon does not alter how the effect is applied or its duration.

The flat armor piercing bonus allows Cytoscramblers, which normally deal a maximum of 5% DPS to hull, to deal as much as 50% vs most medium ships and as much as 25% vs most large ships when combined with a Corrosive Shell Multi-Cannon.
