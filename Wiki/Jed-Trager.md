### Occupation

Alliance Assembly Councillor

**Jed Trager** is a Councillor of the Alliance Assembly. In July 3304, Trager criticised the arrest of Admiral George Varma, a sitting member of the Council of Admirals, by a tri-superpower taskforce that had been assigned to investigate the League of Reparation; the taskforce had obtained evidence that Varma was the League's leader, but since Varma was an Allied citizen who was arrested by Federal and Imperial agents, Trager did not consider the arrest to be legal. Trager was later mollified when it was found that Varma had been framed by the League's true leader, and the admiral was released with the taskforce's apologies.

## Timeline

19 JUL 3304

- Deputy Inspector Mara Klatt of Alliance Interpol has broken her silence regarding the League of Reparation. At a special press conference, she made this announcement: "Prior to her death at the hands of the League of Reparation, I worked closely with my predecessor Chief Inspector Kay Kilbride. She revealed how Fleet Admiral Buchanan's assassination could only have been arranged by a senior figure within the Alliance Defence Force. She was patiently amassing evidence pertaining to this – a task that I inherited when she died. Information decrypted from the League's comms network has confirmed Kilbride's suspicions. I can also confirm that the arrest of Admiral George Varma was due to false leads – misdirection on the part of Varma's protégé within the Alliance Defence Force, Rear Admiral Riri McAllister. Rear Admiral McAllister is Nexus, the League's central coordinator. She has now been arrested and formally charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism. We have released Admiral Varma with our apologies. The decrypted data has also revealed the location of two major League enclaves. The taskforce is organising an operation to eradicate these groups, which we hope will be supported by the galactic community." Council Member Jed Trager was also present at the conference, and remarked: "We all owe a debt of gratitude to Inspector Klatt and the late Chief Inspector Kilbride. Thanks to their dedication, Nexus has at last been unmasked. Hopefully this marks the end of the League's reign of terror."^[1]^

13 JUL 3304

- A member of the Alliance Council of Admirals has been arrested by the taskforce investigating terrorist organisation the League of Reparation. Admiral George Varma was confronted by Captain Niamh Seutonia and Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez during a meeting of admiralty staff at the Donaldson starport in Alioth. Despite protests, he was placed under arrest and escorted to a secure facility. Captain Seutonia gave a brief statement to the media: "We have been trying to determine how the League of Reparation gained access to military-issue weapons, equipment and encryption. We now have evidence that Admiral Varma was secretly redirecting cargo shipments from the Alliance Defence Force to terrorist cells. It's highly likely that Varma is Nexus, the organisation's coordinator, and we are proceeding on that assumption." The arrest has created diplomatic ripples, with Federal and Imperial ambassadors being summoned before the Alliance Assembly. Council member Jed Trager told The Alliance Tribune: "For agents of the Federal Intelligence Agency and Imperial Internal Security Service to abduct an Alliance admiral is an egregious transgression. They will not get away with this." The Council of Admirals has called for an independent inquiry to verify the accusations levied at Admiral Varma. Prime Minister Edmund Mahon made a public statement: "This has come as a great shock, but the body of evidence against Admiral Varma is considerable. I am confident that the trial will be fair, and that our own representative within the tri-superpower taskforce will ensure that justice is done." Deputy Inspector Klatt was unavailable for comment.^[2]^
