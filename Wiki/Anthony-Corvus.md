General of the Imperial Navy

General **Anthony Corvus** is a veteran officer of the Imperial Navy. In September and October 3301, Corvus was one of the main Imperial military leaders who directed the campaign to eradicate Emperor's Dawn cells in Dakshmandi, Maausk, LTT 874, Namarii, and Tabaldak. Corvus expressed doubts that Emperor's Dawn could be easily defeated given its cell organisational structure, and even after Senator Denton Patreus declared the insurgent group had been neutralised on October 28, 3301, the general believed that it should still be considered a viable threat. His caution was later vindicated, as more Emperor's Dawn cells were found in December 3301 and January 3302.

## Timeline

28 OCT 3301

- For the past two weeks, the Empire has been battling the insurgent organisation Emperor's Dawn in the Namarii, Tabaldak and LTT 874 systems. This morning, the Empire confirmed that the campaign had been a resounding success, resulting in the total destruction of all three Emperor's Dawn bases. Senator Denton Patreus, who has been leading the campaign against the insurrectionists, issued a defiant statement: "Today we have delivered a decisive blow to our enemies, shattering their forces and leaving them scattered and defenceless. For all their bluster, these dissidents have been shown themselves to be nothing more than petty brigands, lacking in unity and moral conviction, and unable to withstand the might of our combined military forces. Their bases have been destroyed, their fleets routed. Emperor's Dawn is no longer a threat." But General Anthony Corvus, the veteran responsible for coordinating the Empire's military operations, adopted a more cautious tone: "This is a significant victory, certainly, but the war is not over. Cell organisations such as Emperor's Dawn can be surprisingly resilient, and it would be a mistake to discount them, even at this stage. Once I have seen the very last of their fighters destroyed, I will consider them vanquished. But that day has not yet come."^[1]^

17 SEP 3301

- Four days ago, Imperial senator Denton Patreus launched a military campaign against Emperor's Dawn, the organisation responsible for the murder of Emperor Hengist Duval. Since then, there has been intense conflict in the Dakshmandi and Maausk systems, where two Emperor's Dawn bases are located, with scores of Imperial Navy vessels and Emperor's Dawn ships exchanging fire. Journalist Katherine Ryder, who has reported from war zones across the galaxy in a career spanning more than twenty years, recently met with one of the Imperial generals leading the campaign. In a report for the Imperial Herald, she described the unfolding conflict between the Empire and Emperor's Dawn: "Against the crisp darkness of space drifts a Majestic-Class Interdictor, its elegant lines belying the deadly power of its artillery. A few hours ago, the ship was deep within the Dakshmandi system, overseeing the deployment of Imperial squadrons tasked with rooting out and destroying Emperor's Dawn vessels. For the people of the Dakshmandi and Maausk systems, the arrival of the Imperial fleets has proved divisive: some see the Empire as a saviour, while others fear that the conflict it has incited will do only harm. On the bridge of this stately vessel I meet General Anthony Corvus, the military veteran who recently voiced scepticism about Denton Patreus's campaign. He describes the insurgents as disciplined and methodical, capable of delivering systematic, targeted strikes. With what sounds almost like admiration, he refers to their steely resolve, telling me that no matter how many Emperor's Dawn ships his pilots destroy, the rebels' morale never appears to waver. He also mentions the many hundreds of independent pilots who have boosted the insurrectionists' numbers. Evidently, he says, the Empire's enemies see this conflict as an opportunity to deal a blow to the superpower. The general's remarks highlight a facet of the campaign underscored by Denton Patreus's critics â€“ namely that the senator has underestimated Emperor's Dawn, assuming that the mere sight of an Imperial battle fleet would demoralise the insurgents. In reality, Patreus has found himself drawn into a protracted battle against a disciplined and apparently imperturbable enemy. No one questions the Empire's ability to bring significant firepower to the conflict, but even the Empire's resources are not inexhaustible. If it does not gain an advantage soon, it may have to consider temporarily withdrawing from the conflict, and devising a different strategy."^[2]^

09 SEP 3301

- Imperial senator Denton Patreus has taken a strong stance on Emperor's Dawn, condemning the organisation and vowing to eradicate it from the galaxy, but responses to his statements have so far been mixed. Some have speculated that he is simply trying to curry public favour, while others have suggested he is attempting to draw attention away from his connection to Brendan Paul Darius, the emperor's assassin. Now, the senator's assertions have been questioned by a source from within the Empire itself - General Anthony Corvus of the Imperial Navy. In a statement given to the Imperial Herald, the general said: "We are clearly dealing with a well-organised and highly motivated cell organisation, and despite Denton Patreus's optimism, in my opinion it is too early to make any predictions about its suppression. I have dealt with similar organisations in the past, and they can be surprisingly hard to extinguish. No sooner have you dealt with one cell, another appears somewhere else." Senator Patreus was approached for a response to the general's words, but declined to comment.^[3]^
