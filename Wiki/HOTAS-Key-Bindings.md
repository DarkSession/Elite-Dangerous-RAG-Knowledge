# HOTAS Key Bindings
**HOTAS (Hands On Throttle-And-Stick) and key bindings** for *Elite Dangerous* can be configured in various ways. All game control functions can be mapped as desired by the player on both PC and console versions of the game, but certain controller types such as a HOTAS are only compatible with PCs (exception for Elite Dangerous on consoles would be Thrustmaster HOTAS 4 for PlayStation and HOTAS One for Xbox, both of which support the Thrustmaster T.Flight Rudder Pedals, though on console the pedals mimic existing buttons rather than adding their own axis as they can on PC). Guides to configuring a HOTAS for *Elite Dangerous* can be found below.
