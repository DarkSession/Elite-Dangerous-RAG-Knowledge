## Usage

The Burst Laser inflicts thermal damage, making it very effective against shields and less effective against armour. Although its Armour piercing capability is low, it is slightly higher than that of Beam Lasers. Burst Lasers require more power to use and generate more heat than a Pulse Laser, but not as much as a Beam Laser. The weapon's range is 3000m but Damage Falloff begins at 500m.
