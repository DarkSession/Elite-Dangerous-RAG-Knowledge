**Solid Mineral Spheres** are a form of Notable Stellar Phenomena created by spacefaring microorganisms. They consist of clusters of large sphere-like formations of mineral accretions. The largest spheres in each cluster are likely the oldest, and the clusters may have formed by newer spheres budding off of the older spheres. Solid Mineral Spheres cannot be mined.
