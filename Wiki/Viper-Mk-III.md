## Overview

The Viper Mk III is a combat-focused vessel commonly used by station security forces and other law enforcement organisations. Compared to the multi-role Cobra Mk III, it has the same weapons capacity, slightly stronger shields per shield class, slightly weaker hull, marginally slower turn rate, much faster strafe speed, faster speed under normal thrust and slower speed under boost. The Viper is also currently one of the fastest ships available on the market, and an optimised build can achieve speeds as high as approximately 870 m/s while boosting; the Imperial Eagle can surpass that and reach a little over 900 m/s, but the Viper can turn more easily and activate its boost more frequently.

Its main drawbacks are that its heat dissipation, power generation and hyperspace capacity do not equal that of the Cobra, which limits the value of having the same hardpoint capacity; mounting the ship's full weapon weight makes it very short-ranged, and an energy-heavy armament causes it to either overheat or use all available power very quickly. Fuel is also an issue as the ship comes with capacity of only four tons. In addition to its official police/security role, the Viper's speed, range, and combat capability make it ideal for bounty hunters, small-load couriers, mercenaries or smugglers, while its small cargo capacity makes it a very poor choice for traders, and a survivable but inadequately profitable platform for pirates. With proper fitting, the Viper is an excellent fighter capable of standing its ground against more expensive ships.

Viper MK III hardpoints convergence
 		 	 

The Viper Mk III's weapon hardpoints are located as follows: two Class 1 hardpoints in front of cockpit on the upper surface, and two Class 2 hardpoints on the underside of the ship with one on each side of the cargo scoop. This provides a range of options for weapons loadouts. The Viper Mk III has a delta-shaped hull which tapers to form two prongs at the front. The cockpit is situated just behind the bow, slightly raised. This gives the pilot an excellent view without exposing the canopy to potential damage. The Viper Mk III lands on two small rear struts and one large front strut which doubles as a boarding ramp to the cockpit.
