## Timeline

14 JAN 3306

- Universal Cartographics has updated the names of fifteen systems in the Witch Head enclave. Cynthia Sideris, chair of Universal Cartographics, elaborated on the development: "Last year's colonisation efforts resulted in a number of new settlements in the region, and providing systems with less unwieldy appellations is of great benefit to explorers. For example, 'the Wisanye system' rolls off the tongue much more agreeably than 'the Witch Head Sector FB-X c1-7 system'. We are confident that these more personable memorable terms will be welcomed by the Witch Head community." The Witch Head enclave is currently experiencing a number of Thargoid incursions, prompting local factions to call for assistance.^[1]^

- Cynthia Sideris, chair of Universal Cartographics, made a brief comment outside UC headquarters this morning on Jasmina Halsey's ostensibly unsuccessful search for the "architects of creation": "Whether or not President Halsey's 'architects' exist is open to question, but chances are that some form of non-human sentience exists in our galaxy. We've received data from as far as Beagle Point, but even that represents only an infinitesimal fraction of known stars in the galaxy. We can only keep looking." President Halsey's psychological review continues.

- Commander Sataris, a member of the East India Company, was recently honoured by an anonymous benefactor. To commemorate his mother's recent passing, the rights to register a planet in her name were purchased from Universal Cartography. Cynthia Sideris, chairwoman of Universal Cartography, read a statement from the anonymous benefactor: "Commander Sataris has served with distinction, valour and honour in all his duties, regardless of the circumstances. In honour of his late mother, rights have been purchased to rechristen a world in the BD+26 2184 system as 'Kathy McBrayer'. Any mother capable of rearing a son like Sataris is well deserving of such a memorial. Kathy is an example to us all." Commander Sataris responded by saying: "I invite all members of the Pilots Federation to visit the memorial planet Kathy McBrayer in BD+26 2184." Chairwoman Sideris said that Universal Cartography will finalize the change to the planet's name in the coming weeks.
