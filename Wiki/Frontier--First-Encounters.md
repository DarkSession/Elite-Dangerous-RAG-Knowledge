## Development

David Braben said in an interview with PC Gamer in 1995, *"The idea with First Encounters was to take the bits that worked out of Frontier and make them better. In a sense, the game is a platform for adventures. The way the game's put together, there are similarities. But if you look at the difference between Elite and Frontier, and then compare Frontier with First Encounters..."*^[1]^

*"It's taking, fundamentally, the same idea - you are in space and given a space ship - but at each stage more and different things have been added. In the same way that Frontier had the majority of Elite in it for continuity. First Encounters has a lot of Frontier, but the points, anything that didn't work so well in Frontier has been improved. Now we have a major storyline. There's the fact that there's now a lot more for the dedicated player."*^[1]^

## Box Art

Frontier: First Encounters was first released in the UK and other countries in April 1995. It shipped with in a quite minimalist box design. However, in the USA the publisher Gametek released the game with a much more interesting design. It had detailed full color graphics which improved the product's in-store appeal. For the USA release, the game was only called "First Encounters"; the "Frontier" element was removed for unknown reasons.^[2]^

## World Record

According to Guinness World Records, *"Frontier: First Encounters was the first game to contain procedurally generated terrain and textures."^[3]^*

## Short Stories

A collection of short stories was included; Further Stories Of Life On The Frontier.
