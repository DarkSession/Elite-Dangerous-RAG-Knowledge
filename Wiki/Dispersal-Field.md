# Dispersal Field
**Dispersal Field** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to certain weapons by Engineers. It is an experimental upgrade that causes successful strikes to temporarily confuse all gimbal and turret hardpoints on the target, at the cost of direct damage potential.

Dispersal Field's effect can be likened to that of Chaff, and has a similar duration. The benefit of adding this effect is that unlike Chaff, a successfully-struck target will have their gimballed and turreted hardpoints confused regardless of whether they have targeted the user. This means Dispersal Field affects the target's ability to hit the user as well as any other object, since under normal conditions, gimbals and turrets would reset to straight ahead upon dropping a target lock.

## Applicability

This effect is available to the following weapons:

- Cannon
- Plasma Accelerator

## Materials Required

- 5x Conductive Components
- 5x Hybrid Capacitors
- 5x Worn Shield Emitters
- 5x Irregular Emission Data
