# Cerberus Plague
The **Cerberus Plague** was a contagious disease outbreak that originated in Newton Dock in the BD-02 4304 system and went on to affect over 30 other systems. The deadly disease was caused by a phage-like organism, and was named for a distinctive three-pronged structure at its "head". Symptoms of infection included vomiting blood, excessive sweating, sores, and waves of intense dizziness.

The initial outbreak was reported on June 30, 3301 by Carl Simmons, the chief medical officer of Newton Dock. A lockdown of the starport was quickly enacted, but was too late to prevent the spread of the Cerberus Plague to the neighbouring Dajoar, Eleu and 20 Ophiuchi systems by July 14. Dozens of other systems reported infections over the following weeks, elevating the disease to pandemic status and jeopardizing the lives of billions of people. Fortunately, medical personnel at Hart Station in Bast identified Ceremonial Heike Tea as a potential treatment for the Cerberus Plague on July 29, and it was quickly confirmed that the tea contained ingredients that were effective against the pathogen. By August 10, the Cerberus Plague was eliminated from most systems, and on October 6, the deadliest disease outbreak in generations was declared extinct. A memorial to the outbreak's over 100,000 victims was unveiled at Hart Station.

At a health summit on March 23, 3302, Carl Simmons asserted that the eradication of the Cerberus Plague was only made possible by the early discovery of Ceremonial Heike Tea as a cure. Production levels of the tea would have been insufficient to contain the disease if it had spread any further, and trillions likely would have perished. That same month, a new strain of Cerberus Plague was documented at Wilkes Orbital in Nespeleve among the rescued survivors of Professor Ishmael Palin's research team, who had been abducted and deliberately infected with it by an unknown party, possibly Black Flight, but an outbreak was prevented and the strain was eradicated thanks to deliveries of Ceremonial Heike Tea.

## Timeline

19 AUG 3305

- The Sap Core Legion faction has launched an initiative to build a state-of-the-art medical facility in the Heike system. Heike has some significance in the field of medicine – a species of tea plant native to the system played a vital role in the development of a cure for the Cerberus Plague. Sap Core Legion believes that this detail makes Heike an ideal location for the new installation. Professor Macklin Fox, speaking on behalf of Sap Core Legion, said: "Sap Core Legion wishes to build this facility in response to a number of recent outbreaks and epidemics. When one also considers the current Thargoid conflict, we feel humanity would benefit from additional off-world medical resources." Independent pilots have been invited to deliver advanced medicines, thallium and medical diagnostic equipment to Braun Enterprise in the Heike system. The initiative is scheduled to run from August 29th to September 4th 3305. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.^[1]^

11 AUG 3302

- On the 30th of June 3301, Newton Dock in the BD-02 4304 system was quarantined due to the outbreak of a mysterious plague. This pathogen – named the Cerberus Plague – eventually spread to over 20 systems and claimed 100,000 lives. Thanks to the support of the galaxy's independent pilots, a cure derived from Ceremonial Heike Tea was discovered and used to treat victims at Hart Station in the Bast System. The cure was then synthesised, mass produced and shipped to other affected systems. On the 10th of August 3301, the last affected systems were declared free of the Cerberus Plague. In tribute to these pilots' heroic efforts, the Buckyball Racing Club is hosting a special event at Hart Station. The race will involve a scramble around nearby medicine-production facilities and a speed run to Brunel City in Heike.

24 MAR 3302

- Professor Ishmael Palin has shocked medical personnel at Wilkes Orbital by returning to work only hours after he received the antidote to the Cerberus Plague. According to Palin's doctor, the professor was eager to talk to Lea Tantaga, the molecular chemist who recently developed a material capable of countering the Unknown Artefacts' self-repair mechanism. The scientists' conversation resulted in the following statement from Professor Palin: "The significance of Professor Tantaga's breakthrough is clear: the means to safely contain the Unknown Artefacts is now within our grasp. What we need now are quantities of meta-alloys so we can produce more of the UA-resistant material." A conglomerate based in the Maia system has pledged to support the appeal by mass-producing the UA-resistant material, assuming sufficient quantities of meta-alloys are received. This will then be used to create special ship modules that can safely transport the Unknown Artefacts. The Pioneer's Cooperative has placed an open order for meta-alloys, and has promised to generously reward pilots who contribute to the initiative. The campaign begins on the 24th March 3302 and will run for one week.^[3]^

24 MAR 3302

- Authorities at Wilkes Orbital have announced that the recent appeal for Ceremonial Heike Tea has been a significant success. Personnel at the starport launched the appeal when they discovered that the individuals recently rescued from the Blue Hand Gang were infected with a strain of the Cerberus Plague. The galactic community was unequivocal in its support of the appeal, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to Wilkes Orbital. Governor Lawrence, the station's principal administrator, released a statement to the media: "Thanks to the swift response of the galactic community, we are now in a position to treat those infected by the Cerberus Plague. The surplus Ceremonial Heike Tea will be stockpiled to ensure that any further outbreaks can be immediately neutralised." Since news of the epidemic first broke, questions have been raised about how Professor Palin and his colleagues could have been infected by the pathogen. Drusus Kane, head of an Imperial counter-insurgency unit in the Achenar system, offered his opinion: "The chances of these individuals being contaminated by accident are extremely small. I believe the abductors deliberately infected Professor Palin and his colleagues, possibly in order to disseminate the disease among the wider galactic population. Fortunately, on this occasion their plans were not successful."^[4]^

23 MAR 3302

- Carl Simmons, chief medical officer at Newton Dock in the BD-02 4304 system, spoke at a health summit over the weekend. His keynote address was on the Cerberus plague. "The original Cerberus plague spread to over 30 systems inside a month, putting billions of lives at risk," said Simmons. "It is unlikely we would have been able to eradicate the disease had the cure been discovered any later, as ceremonial Heike tea would not have been available in sufficient quantities. Trillions could have perished. We cannot afford to underestimate this new strain of Cerberus plague, and I urge the medical community to take the outbreak seriously. If Heike tea is not delivered in sufficient quantities, or if this strain proves resistant to the tea's effects, the consequences could be catastrophic."

17 MAR 3302

- The normally peaceful Wilkes Orbital has been the focus of considerable attention in recent weeks. First, the starport was at the centre of a campaign to drive the Blue Hand Gang from the nearby Orulas system. Then authorities at the station announced that the escape pods recovered in the operation contained Professor Ishmael Palin and the other members of his research team. Now it seems that the majority of those recovered from the criminals, including Professor Ishmael Palin, have been infected with a strain of Cerberus Plague, the deadly pathogen that claimed millions of lives last year. Governor Lawrence, the principal administrator of Wilkes Orbital, has released a statement to the media: "The situation is certainly serious, but it's important to keep things in perspective. At present, the disease is confined to those who were rescued from the Blue Hand Gang, so it should be perfectly possible to keep it contained. The pertinent task is to cure the infected." Governor Lawrence was asked how he intended to proceed. "This is a new strain of the Cerberus Plague, one we've never seen before. But it seems that Ceremonial Heike Tea, which was used to cure the original strain of the plague, is also effective against this version of the disease. We have therefore issued an open order for Ceremonial Heike Tea with which to cure the infected. Any surplus tea will be stockpiled in anticipation of further outbreaks, although I should stress that such a scenario is extremely unlikely." The appeal for Ceremonial Heike Tea begins on the 17th March 3302 and will run for one week.^[6]^

06 OCT 3301

- The Cerberus Plague was one of the most devastating outbreaks to blight the galaxy for generations, devastating dozens of systems and affecting countless worlds. Official figures place the death toll at over 100,000. As of today, however, the disease is officially considered extinct. Carl Simmons, the specialist who led research into a cure, has confirmed that no new outbreaks of the plague have been reported since early August, and that the disease can therefore be considered eradicated. This announcement follows months of work from medical teams across the galaxy, who – with the support of many independent pilots – have laboured tirelessly to deliver the Cerberus antidote to those affected by the plague. To mark this event, and in remembrance of those who lost their lives to the Cerberus Plague, officials at Hart Station have commissioned a special memorial. Governor Albrecht, administrator of Hart Station, unveiled the monument with the following words: "It is my solemn duty to dedicate this memorial to the many men, women and children whose lives were claimed by the Cerberus Plague. Their light may be gone from the galaxy, but they will live on in our hearts."^[7]^

10 AUG 3301

- Official sources at Hart Station have confirmed that efforts to eliminate pirate vessels targeting medical supply ships in the region have been resoundingly successful. The Union of Bast Liberals, which placed bounties on the pirates, has stated that a total of 1,869 independent pilots helped to thin the bandits' numbers, thereby allowing the much-need Cerberus antidote to reach systems affected by the disease. Consequently, the Cerberus Plague has been eliminated from the following systems:
Cantjarisni
Rajukru
HIP 10175
Amahu
Leerham
BD-11 4280
Louguala
Altair
39 Tauri
Kamorin
Delta Phoenicis
Kappa Ophiuchi
Murung
LTT 14850
Gali
Cauani
LTT 6705
Watha
Asgaa
Svent
A spokesperson from the Union of Bast Liberals said: "There are times when the words 'thank you' just don't seem adequate. These pilots have saved literally thousands of lives, so, on behalf of all those they have helped, we want to offer our sincerest gratitude."^[8]^

06 AUG 3301

- The fight against the Cerberus Plague, which to date has claimed thousands of lives, appears to be gaining ground. Following the efforts of medical teams to deliver the antidote to systems affected by the disease, reports have reached us that the plague has been eradicated from the following systems:
Dajoar
Bastes
Maheou Ti
Eleu
Ochoeng
20 Ophiuchi
Una
Santjalan
BD-02 4304
Chongguls
Xamentii
G 139-50
Meanwhile, the effort to help those suffering from the disease continues.^[9]^

06 AUG 3301

- Although a cure for the Cerberus Plague has been found, the disease has not yet been eradicated, and it continues to wreak havoc in certain systems.
The following systems have been affected by the plague:
Cantjarisni
Rajukru
HIP 10175
Amahu
Leerham
BD-11 4280
Louguala
In these systems, the following station services are unavailable:
Re-arming
Market
Bulletin board
Docking
Shipyard
Outfitting
Black market
Authorities in these systems have reported that services will remain offline until the Cerberus Plague has been either contained or eliminated.^[10]^

06 AUG 3301

- While medical teams across the galaxy work to deliver the Cerberus Plague antidote to systems affected by the disease, fresh outbreaks of the pathogen are appearing in other systems. According to recent reports, the following systems are currently affected by the Cerberus Plague:
Altair
39 Tauri
Kamorin
Delta Phoenicis
Kappa Ophiuchi
Murung
LTT 14850
Gali
Cauani
LTT 6705
Watha
Asgaa
Svent
Any independent pilots who wish to help are encouraged to eliminate the pirates targeting medical supply convoys in the Bast system. The Union of Bast Liberals is currently offering rewards to pilots who destroy these pirates.^[11]^

05 AUG 3301

- According to officials at Hart Station, medical supply ships transporting the Cerberus Plague antidote from the starport are being targeted by pirates. Naturally, these attacks are substantially undermining attempts to eliminate the disease, which continues to affect a number of systems. One official said: "It's just despicable. I wouldn't expect compassion from pirates, of course. But don't they understand that this affects them, too? If the Cerberus Plague isn't eliminated, it could spread to every corner of the galaxy. Everyone will suffer, even the pirates. Do they think they’re immune or something?" In an effort to combat the threat posed by the pirates, the Union of Bast Liberals has started offering rewards to those who eliminate any of the pirate vessels. With luck, this will allow the medical ships to deliver the cure to those who so desperately need it.^[12]^

02 AUG 3301

- The drive to deliver quantities of Ceremonial Heike Tea to Hart Station in the Bast System continues, as the starport's medical teams work around the clock to create as much of the Cerberus Plague antidote as they can. According to Carl Simmons, the Chief Medical Officer of Newton Dock, the rare tea is the only substance that can counter the virulent effects of the disease. Independent pilots who are in a position to help with the effort are reminded that the Union Of Bast Liberals is offering incentives to pilots who deliver Ceremonial Heike Tea, which can only be purchased in Brunel City Station in Heike, to Hart Station.^[13]^

30 JUL 3301

- Although a cure for the Cerberus Plague has been found, the disease has not yet been eradicated, and it continues to wreak havoc in certain systems. Starports in the following systems have been affected by the plague:
Bastes
Maheou Ti
Ochoeng
Una
Santjalan
In these systems, the following station services are unavailable:
Re-arming
Market
Bulletin board
Docking
Shipyard
Outfitting
Black market
Authorities in the relevant systems have reported that services will remain offline until the Cerberus Plague has been either contained or eliminated.^[14]^

30 JUL 3301

- While medical teams across the galaxy work to develop the quantities of antidote needed to eliminate the Cerberus Plague, fresh outbreaks of the disease are appearing in other systems. Our sources indicate that the following systems are currently affected by the Cerberus Plague:
Chongguls
Xamentii
G 139-50
Cantjarisni
Rajukru
HIP 10175
Amahu
Leerham
BD-11 4280
Louguala
Any independent pilots who wish to help those affected are encouraged to deliver medicines to the systems listed above.^[15]^

29 JUL 3301

- Medical personnel at Hart Station were unanimous in their praise for the many Commanders who delivered medicines to the Bast System as part of an ongoing effort to help those afflicted with the Cerberus Plague. A spokesperson at Hart Station released the following statement: "We are immensely grateful to the 765 independent pilots who delivered medicine to the primary care facility here at Hart Station. Through their charitable efforts, we were able to bring relief to thousands of patients, and also to devote time we would not otherwise have had to our ongoing search for a cure. What's more, we think we may have made a breakthrough in that area. So to all those who contributed, we just want to say a heartfelt thank you." Apparently, patients at Hart Station who were offered Ceremonial Heike Tea showed some improvement in their health. When other patients experienced similar recoveries, the local team ran tests and sent samples to Carl Simmons, Chief Medical Officer of Newton Dock in BD-02 4304, who is leading research into a cure. He offered the following brief statement: "Patients were offered the tea simply to lift their spirits, but it apparently contains ingredients that can actually cure those afflicted with the pathogen. The tea is quite rare, however, and is only found in Heike, so I suspect it will be quite a challenge to gather the quantities that we need." We can only hope this news signals a turning point in the fight against the Cerberus Plague.^[16]^

27 JUL 3301

- In response to the devastating Cerberus Plague outbreak on the frontier, the Dukes of Mikunn have mobilized their members, the Mercenaries of Mikunn, to affected systems in an attempt to assist local governments in quelling the plagues. Having faced a plague similar to that affecting current star systems for weeks, the massive amount of stockpiled medicine will now be moved to affected systems along with medical scientists in hopes of finding the source of the plague. Fighter wings have also been scrambled to provide safe passage for pilots carrying medicine and to enforce quarantine on local citizens. When asked about the extreme measures they are employing the younger brother of the Dukes, Caius, stated: "When we had to deal with the infamous plague of HR 7327 our thoughts went to the people first and foremost, but by not locking down the system and enforcing quarantine the plague had spread to all nearby systems. For weeks we dealt with the same plague in Mikunn, Sukua and Sefry's on top of HR 7327. It was then that we realized that enforcing quarantine would benefit the people more than not enforcing one. The current spread of the epidemic is due to the failure of the powers to act in the best interest of their own people." Mercenary wings are expected to arrive later today and will remain within the affected systems until the outbreak has been dealt with.

23 JUL 3301

- News of fresh cases of the Cerberus Plague has caused mass panic among the populations of Shepherd Hub in the Bastes System, Yegorov Station in the Maheou Ti system and Roddenberry Gateway in the Ochoeng system. Even though the number of cases reported so far is relatively low, the medical services and hospitals have been overwhelmed by citizens desperate for treatment, despite not being infected. Station authorities have appealed for calm and restricted movement to only the most essential travel. States of emergency have been declared and open contracts for urgent medical and aid supplies are being issued for these systems.^[18]^

23 JUL 3301

- Reports that the Cerberus Plague has reached Hart Station in the Bast system, Hoard Orbital in the Una system and Cantor Terminal in the Santjalan system is causing fear amongst the population. So far a cure hasn't been found for this disease despite the continuing work of Carl Simmons, the Chief Medical Officer of Newton Dock, and medical teams in the surrounding systems. In a statement he reiterated that people should remain at home. Hospitals and care facilities in these systems are already overloaded as the number of infected people rapidly rises. Volunteers and local security personnel are aiding the health services in managing the crisis as well as trying to maintain the rule of law. Any pilots in the region are being called upon to help deliver medical aid to the affected starports.^[19]^

22 JUL 3301

- Due to the ongoing crisis caused the Cerberus Plague, key station services at the following starports are not currently available. The following starports are affected:
In the Dajoar system:
Thiel Port
Crown Terminal
Patrick Terminal
Macquorn Rankine Port
Ejeta Enterprise
In the Eleu system:
Finney Dock
Bao Orbital
Elder Station
Tem Station
Pierce Gateway
Bradshaw Station
In the 20 Ophiuchi system:
Chargaff Port
Artsebarsky Gateway
The following station services are unavailable:
Re-arming
Market
Bulletin Board
Docking
Shipyard
Outfitting
Black Market
The authorities on these starports report that services will remain offline until the Cerberus Plague has been contained and resources can be spared to work on these facilities.^[20]^

16 JUL 3301

- With increasing reports concerning the so-called 'Cerberus Plague', officials from Dajoar, Eleu and 20 Ophiuchi have all declared states of emergency. They are calling on bounty hunters and combat-capable pilots in the region help protect the relief efforts. The issue arises at the same time that some medics in the systems have stated that the vaccines are not proving as effective against these cases, leading to speculation that the organism has mutated. Carl Simmons, the Chief Medical Officer of Newton Dock and leading the medical team combating this infection, commented: "While there are some indications that the organism has changed, we are still analysing the data and it is too early to draw any conclusions." Further muddying the waters, a representative for one of the pirate gangs claimed that they were helping the right people. In an anonymous statement, they declared: "As usual it is the rich and well-connected that benefit from official channels. We are simply making sure that these supplies reach the people who need them the most."^[21]^

14 JUL 3301

- The heroic efforts of the local authorities at Newton Dock in BD-02 4304, combined with independent pilots from far and wide, have slowed the outbreak affecting the local population. Carl Simmons, the Chief Medical Officer of Newton Dock, responded to reports of further infections in the nearby systems: Dajoar, Eleu and 20 Ophiuchi. "We can confirm that there have been isolated incidents which we believe are the same infectious agent that we have seen here on Newton Dock. The populations in those systems should not be alarmed and three operations have been initiated to isolate the sick and prevent further outbreak." When asked how the disease had spread to those systems, he replied: "We can't confirm the vector as yet. Our current belief is that these cases are simply people from here who managed to travel before restrictions were in place. However, as with any outbreak of this magnitude, we are not taking anything for granted." He concluded his statement with: "Once again we are calling on the resources of the independent pilots in the region to help ensure that these cases do not develop into a full-blown outbreak as seen here on Newton Dock." While he denied that the team were calling the new disease the Cerberus Plague, one technician did confirm that the name was being used unofficially and came from an unusual three-pronged structure at the 'head' of the phage-like organism.^[22]^

30 JUN 3301

- Hundreds of businesses have closed and thousands of people are quarantined following an outbreak aboard Newton Dock in what could be the most devastating epidemic of the decade. The illness, the origins of which are currently unknown, has made its way across much of the region. Reports are coming in from surrounding systems indicating that the infection might already be spreading. Carl Simmons, the Chief Medical Officer of Newton Dock, released the following statement in regards to the spread of this disease: "At the risk of causing a panic, it is my duty to report that the outbreak is spreading at an alarming rate. Until we have identified how it managed to reach so many systems in such a short span of time, residents are advised to stay in their homes and travellers are advised to avoid the area. Early signs of infection include vomiting blood, excessive sweating, sores and waves of intense dizziness. If you suspect you've been infected, please report to the local authorities at the earliest available opportunity. They will inform you how to proceed." In total almost 27 million residents now find themselves at risk from either disease, famine or both.^[23]^
