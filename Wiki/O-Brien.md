Federal Navy Admiral

**O'Brien** was an Admiral of the Federal Navy. In 3101, O'Brien led a fleet into the Cemiess system and invaded the planet Emerald after the Empire began colonising it. The aggressive move was a response to Federal suspicions that the Empire had assassinated the influential Federal Governor Raul "Proxmire" Santorini of Tau Ceti in 3098 to silence the loudest opposition to claiming Cemiess. For the next thirty years, O'Brien's forces and the Imperial XV Fleet battled for control of Cemiess, but the Empire prevailed in the end. O'Brien's actions were subsequently popularised in the holo-vid drama "O'Brien's War".^[1]^
