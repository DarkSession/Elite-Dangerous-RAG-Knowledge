There is reputed to be a seedier side to the colony whereby lonely visitors may enter without a permit while the guards turn a blind eye for a fee, but this is always denied.

## History

In 2903, Maurice Grant was assassinated before he could assume office as Ross 128's leader and the colony devolved into chaos. A Federal task force arrived in 2905 to restore order and took charge of the system, resulting in the enforcement of a new colonial charter that re-classified the Ross 128 colony as a penal and correctional facility.^[1]^
