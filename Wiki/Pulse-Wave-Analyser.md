The **Pulse Wave Analyser** is a utility module used in mining. Activating it while within a planetary ring or asteroid cluster emits a fast-moving pulse of energy that will briefly highlight any asteroids with lucrative deposits within range.^[1]^

## Usage

The intensity of the pulse's highlighting reflects an asteroid's deposit density and whether or not it is a crackable "motherlode" asteroid with a core deposit. Dull, translucent coloration indicates only surface deposits are present, while bright, opaque coloration indicates the presence of a core deposit. The colors red, orange, and yellow indicate the areas on an asteroid where deposits are located, and do not necessarily correspond to deposit density.

## Specifications

> 
> 
> Scans the local environment for subtle variations in the structure and composition of solid objects. When triggered, an EM wave will pulse out from the ship and pass over any objects within range. It is calibrated to highlight anomalies detected within asteroids, interpreting this data as a glow and varying its size based on basic composition and density data, as well as distance from the ship. This information is analysed internally then relayed directly to the cockpit HUD, visualising it as a 360 degree wave. Once a potential deposit asteroid is found, a Prospector Limpet should be used to gain more detail information on its composition. Can only be used in normal space and only functions in analysis mode.
