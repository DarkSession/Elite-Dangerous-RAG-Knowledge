Former President of the Federation

**Antonia Madison** served as the President of the Federation from 3264 to 3272.^[1]^

During the administration of President Eugene Cooper, Madison held the position of Shadow President. When Cooper lost his mandatory mid-term vote of no confidence in Federal Congress, the charismatic Madison succeeded in having her proposal for a successor administration approved, becoming one of only a handful of shadow presidents throughout history to ascend to the Federal presidency by that method.^[2]^ In 3301, Zachary Hudson became the next shadow president to accomplish the same feat.^[3]^

In 3271, Madison presented a commendation to then-Chief Gunnery Officer Aden Tanner for his role in the "Autolycus Mutiny". Tanner had refused an order from his commanding officer, Captain Jaiden Horne of the Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser Autolycus, to open fire on civilian ships fleeing the rebel-occupied Coldharbour Station that Horne believed were part of a rebel attack. Thanks to Tanner, the ships escaped unharmed. Horne had Tanner tried for mutiny, but it later emerged that the civilian ships had been carrying evacuees and Horne had been experiencing a drug-induced psychosis at the time. Horne committed suicide, and Tanner was cleared of all charges.^[4]^

## Timeline

15 FEB 3308

- President Zachary Hudson's intention to remove the limit on his term in office has caused a deep rift among congressmen and voters alike. Political correspondent Sofia Trevino analysed the situation in The Federal Times: "Ever since the 77th amendment to the Federal Accord was ratified in 2594, no president has remained in office for longer than eight years. This is why the Hudson Contravention, as Congress officially refers to it, has turned up the heat on the simmering political division within the Federation. Members of the Cabinet and other leading Republicans have argued passionately that only Zachary Hudson has the experience and fortitude to guide the Federation through this eventful period in history. His supporters point to successes such as curtailing the secession crisis, ending the NMLA threat and introducing greater security via the Proactive Detection Bureau. However, others insist that repealing this amendment could pave the way from democracy to dictatorship. Two former presidents – Antonia Madison and Jasmina Halsey – have publicly condemned the Hudson Contravention as unconstitutional and dangerous. There are expectations that Shadow President Felicia Winters will move for a vote of no confidence. Political analysts suspect that after several controversial leadership decisions from Hudson last year, he would be unlikely to win over a majority in Congress."^[5]^

30 MAY 3301

- There is blood in the water and the politicians have begun hunting their prey. Yesterday, Shadow President Hudson placed a motion before Congress asking that they issue a Vote of No Confidence against President Halsey's administration. The motion was accepted, and the vote has been scheduled to take place on Monday afternoon. According to historic procedure, if a Vote of No Confidence in the encumbent President succeeds, then the Shadow President gets the chance to form an administration, which in turn is then put to a vote. If this fails, then a full congressional election is triggered. The Shadow President succeeding in these circumstances is not unheard of, but pretty rare. The last occasion was when the increasingly unpopular Eugene Cooper was ousted by the charismatic Antonia Madison in 3264 following a mid-term Vote of No Confidence.^[2]^
