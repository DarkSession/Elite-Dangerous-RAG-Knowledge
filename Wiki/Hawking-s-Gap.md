# Hawking's Gap
**Hawking's Gap** is galactic region #19 in the Milky Way. It is bordered by Norma Expanse, Dryman's Point, Lyra's Song, Achilles's Altar, and Inner Orion Spur. The region was named after 21st century astrophysicist Stephen Hawking by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the forerunner of Universal Cartographics, in the late 22nd century.

In 3270, Project Dynasty secretly dispatched four ill-fated expeditions to separate regions of the galaxy to identify Earth-like worlds for future colonisation. One of these expeditions arrived in Hawking's Gap and left four marker settlements that used the incorrect name "Hawkins Gap", possibly due to data corruption.
