# The Abyss
**The Abyss** is galactic region #40 in the Milky Way. It is bordered by Acheron, Formorian Frontier, Hieronymus Delta, and Outer Scutum-Centaurus Arm.

Situated on the Milky Way's northern edge, The Abyss is over 60,000 lightyears away from Sol. It is the location of the famous explorer destination Beagle Point. Stars in this region are so sparse that plotting routes can be difficult for ships with lower jump ranges even with the use of Synthesis.
