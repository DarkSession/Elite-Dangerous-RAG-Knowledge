## History

Following the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army's bombings of four Imperial starports in September 3306, the Imperial Internal Security Service traced the origin of the NMLA's custom corrosive bombs to Liz Ryder and the Eurybia Blue Mafia. The IISS requested that the Eurybia Blue Mafia turn Ryder over to them for interrogation, but were denied, and the IISS ordered the Keltim Empire League to invade the system and capture Ryder on October 1, 3306. The Keltim Empire League dispatched the megaship Prelude to Victory to Eurybia to support its war effort.^[1]^ With the help of numerous independent pilots, the Eurybia Blue Mafia defeated the Keltim Empire League on October 8, retaining control of Eurybia and protecting Ryder. The Eurybia Blue Mafia insisted in a public broadcast that the IISS's accusation that their organisation and Ryder were working with the NMLA was based solely on supposition.^[2]^

On October 12, Ryder confirmed that while she had in fact designed the NMLA's bombs, she had been deceived about who was contracting her for the project, and was unaware that the bombs would be used for anything other than demolition purposes or that they would be loaded with Thargoid caustic enzymes. She voluntarily provided all available data on the contract to the IISS to clear the name of the Eurybia Blue Mafia. In return, the IISS rescinded its warrant for her arrest and moved on from the Eurybia incident.^[3]^
