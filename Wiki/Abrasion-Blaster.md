The **Abrasion Blaster** is a hardpoint module used in mining. It is designed to break Surface Deposits off of asteroids, allowing them to be collected using the Cargo Scoop or Collector Limpets.^[1]^ A Refinery is required for material excavated using an Abrasion Blaster.

## Specifications

> 
> 
> Unlike the mining laser, the abrasion blaster only functions on surface deposits that appear on asteroids. The blaster breaks apart these chunks using a carefully tuned pulse of energy, rather than the focused thermic power of the standard mining laser. A refinery module is required to process asteroid chunks into saleable commodities. Only functions in analysis mode.
