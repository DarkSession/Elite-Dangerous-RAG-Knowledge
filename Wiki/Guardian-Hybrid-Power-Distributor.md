The **Guardian Hybrid Power Distributor** is a Power Distributor that has been modified with Guardian technology. Capacitor recharge rates are increased, but additional heat is generated and the capacitors themselves have a lower overall capacity. In addition, the module increases the total power output of any Power Plant or Guardian Hybrid Power Plant by 4%, resulting in 104% total available power. In order to purchase the Guardian Hybrid Power Distributor, it must first be unlocked through a Technology Broker.
