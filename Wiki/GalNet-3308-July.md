### Leaders Respond to Azimuth Initiative

The anti-xeno operation in HIP 22460 involving Azimuth Biotech and the superpowers has drawn comments from prominent political figures.

Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval: “I agree with Senator Patreus that supporting Azimuth’s proposal remains our most practical course of action. However, alternative options for tackling the Thargoid threat are required.”

Princess Aisling Duval: “Salvation is clearly a master of self-promotion and public manipulation. I only hope that the Empire does not regret associating with this distasteful individual.”

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon: “Our military presence in HIP 22460, coupled with the strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation, shows that the long-term security of Allied systems remains our priority.”

Councillor Nakato Kaine: “Two ruthless corporations with disreputable histories, and the Alliance is now collaborating with both. This a deeply regrettable chapter in our history.”

President Zachary Hudson: “I have every confidence in the Federal Navy to protect Salvation while the Proteus Wave is prepared. This is a long-overdue reprisal against an intractable and relentless enemy.”

Shadow President Felicia Winters: “Azimuth’s superweapon is effective, I’ll admit. But I’m unhappy with relying on this clandestine organisation, rather than an accountable anti-xeno agency.”

CEO Li Yong-Rui: “Sirius Corporation is observing activities in HIP 22460 with great interest. I am keen to explore cooperation with Azimuth Biotech on developing new products using Proteus Wave technology.”

Simguru Pranav Antal: “The advanced electromagnetic sciences developed by the Guardians over a million years ago remain poorly understood, even to Utopia’s keenest minds. The safety and effectiveness of Salvation’s device cannot be guaranteed.”

## 04 JUL

### Far God Cult Condemns Salvation

Azimuth Biotech’s operation in the HIP 22460 system has been publicly denounced by the Thargoid-worshipping fringe religion.

A video message from a hooded young woman aboard the Testament, the cult’s missionary vessel, was transmitted directly to the newsfeed Vox Galactica:

“This plan to entrap and destroy the heralds of the Far God must cease immediately. As the newly appointed First Apostle of the True Chapters, I beseech those in authority not to support Salvation’s evil crusade. To slaughter these holy beings is a monstrous act of deicide.”

Dr Alfred Ulyanov, a leading authority on the enigmatic sect, commented:

“It is extremely unusual for Far God believers to make any kind of announcement or acknowledge current events. They accept their own deaths with equanimity, believing as they do that all life will be extinguished when the Far God emerges from hyperspace. But they are clearly incensed by Salvation’s intention to eliminate the Thargoid fleet, viewing it as a blasphemous attack against their deity.”

“We cannot identify the messenger, although her Imperial accent is a surprise considering the cult has been outlawed in the Empire. ‘First Apostle’ is an unexpected new rank among their leaderless hierarchy, and suggests she has been elevated to spokesperson status. ‘True Chapters’ is likewise a departure from their usual sequential numbering, raising the possibility that this is a sub-sect branching off from the orthodox faith.”

## 05 JUL

### Guardian Artefacts Needed to Power Superweapon

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Azimuth Biotech urgently requires deliveries of Guardian artefacts to HIP 22460 as vital components of the Proteus Wave.

Salvation issued an official request to the Allied, Federal and Imperial taskforces, which was then shared via public channels:

“We have now begun assembly of the Proteus Wave. Our existing stockpile of Guardian material was sufficient to begin construction, but we must now establish a supply line capable of delivering the quantity needed to finish the weapon.”

Azimuth Biotech has established an initiative to encourage independent pilots to supply the Bright Sentinel megaship with Guardian commodities. Azimuth are also offering additional ship liveries to contributors.

Pilots can deliver any combination of Guardian caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns to the Bright Sentinel megaship in the HIP 22460 system.

## 06 JUL

### Federation Targets Narcotics Syndicate

The Federal Intelligence Agency has launched a multi-system crackdown against the organised crime network known as Red Family.

Synchronised raids are currently taking place in over a dozen systems across Federal space. Multiple ships, properties and manufacturing plants connected to Red Family’s illegal operations are being seized.

FIA Deputy Director Bethany Blake provided a statement to The Federal Times:

“For decades the Red Family cartel has trafficked colossal quantities of dangerous drugs to our citizens, leaving a trail of death and misery behind them. The FIA dealt a severe blow to the syndicate in 3305, but its kingpin Oberon Church escaped justice and remains one of the most wanted criminals in the Federation.”

“This current operation was only possible thanks to the Proactive Detection Bureau. Our algorithms intercepted key messages that identified Red Family’s allies within local security forces and legal businesses.”

“Field agents are now making mass arrests, despite armed resistance at many locations. This time we will locate Church and take him into custody, which will cause his organisation to crumble.”

The Proactive Detection Bureau monitors all communications within the Federation to identify illegal activity and prevent terrorism. It was established in 3307 when new public surveillance laws were passed in the wake of large-scale attacks by the NMLA.

## 7 JUL

### HIP 22460 Receives Vital Supplies

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Medical and military commodities have been delivered to the HIP 22460 system in support of the anti-xeno operation.

Commodore Morag Halloran expressed gratitude that so many Commanders took part in the initiative. She indicated that payment was now available from the megaship Heart of Taurus. This includes tailored ship liveries for those Commanders who made the greatest contributions.

Azimuth Biotech has requested that pilots continue supporting the operation by obtaining Guardian artefacts, which will form part of the Proteus Wave’s construction process. These can be delivered to the Bright Sentinel megaship.

The shipments of advanced medicines, basic medicines and reactive armour will be distributed by Azimuth Biotech to the Allied, Federal and Imperial taskforces within the system.

Experimental anti-xeno weaponry has been installed on the three taskforce flagships: the Alliance megaship Oath of Tyndareus, the Farragut-class battle cruiser FNS Fortitude, and the Majestic-class interdictor INV Audacious Dream. Both the Federal and Imperial Navies intend to reinforce their presence in HIP 22460 at the appropriate time.

### The Salvation Stratagem

As the superpowers establish their fleets in the HIP 22460 system, Azimuth Biotech prepares to deliver a decisive blow against the Thargoids.

A segment from Salvation’s briefing to the anti-xeno taskforce admirals was shared by Azimuth:

“The Proteus Wave relies on power sources and components of Guardian origin, which will inevitably draw the Thargoids to HIP 22460. As we know, their hostile reaction to stockpiles of Guardian artefacts is instinctive. They have no defence against the weaponry of their ancient enemies, other than to launch pre-emptive strikes to prevent it being deployed.”

“Therefore, the Bright Sentinel must be protected as a priority while delivered artefacts are processed for transport to the Proteus Wave site, with independent pilots who support our endeavour aiding these efforts. I cannot stress enough how vital it is to keep the enemy at bay during this phase of the plan.”

“The Proteus Wave will be constructed on the surface of HIP 22460 10b. Its core mechanism will be calibrated to interface with one of the extant Thargoid structures present on the moon. The structure will amplify the Proteus Wave’s electromagnetic pulse to permanently shut down every Thargoid vessel within range.”

“Providing your combined forces can keep the Thargoid vessels occupied, the finished superweapon will ensure humanity’s final victory against the aliens. There will be no need for further superweapons when the Thargoid threat has been extinguished once and for all.”

## 8 JUL

### Thargoids Launch Attack in HIP 22460

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The HIP 22460 system has been invaded by large numbers of Thargoid vessels, with several multi-craft conflicts already reported.

An alert was broadcast by Commodore Morag Halloran, military coordinator for Azimuth Biotech:

“As Salvation predicted, the Thargoids have detected the large-scale concentration of Guardian artefacts aboard the Bright Sentinel. Thargoid interceptors and scouts are now swarming throughout HIP 22460.”

“The Allied, Federal and Imperial taskforces have engaged the enemy. But it is crucial that their efforts are supplemented by as many additional ships as we can muster. All available independent pilots and AX squadrons are requested to take part in counter-offensives against the Thargoids.”

“It is also important to protect traders who are entering the system to deliver Guardian artefacts to the Bright Sentinel. The construction of the Proteus Wave relies on these vital components, and supply routes must not be interrupted by Thargoid strikes.”The Alliance megaship Oath of Tyndareus, the Farragut-class battle cruiser FNS Fortitude, and the Majestic-class interdictor INV Audacious Dream are coordinating the tactical deployment of the superpowers’ taskforces in HIP 22460.

## 11 JUL

### Red Family Kingpin Eludes the FIA

Oberon Church, founder of the crime syndicate Red Family, has managed to avoid capture by the Federal Intelligence Agency.

The Federal Times’s crime correspondent Ethan Takahashi reported on the latest developments:

“In many ways, the FIA’s operation against Red Family can be considered a success. Coordinated raids and arrests have seized most of the organisation’s assets, including colossal amounts of illegal narcotics and weapons.”

“But Oberon Church has lived up to his self-styled image as ‘the man of smoke’, forever drifting through the fingers of those who try to grasp him. And until this notorious drug lord is finally apprehended, the agency cannot relent in its work.”

“Proactive Detection Bureau analysts are working to decrypt communications found on captured data drives. They believe these include coordinates where the surviving syndicate members are gathering to protect their leader.”

“Several FIA agents have told me that the opportunity to take Church captive is narrowing. They fear that unless the PDB can pinpoint Red Family’s bolthole soon, he will once again escape justice.”

## 12 JUL

### Guardian Artefact Initiative Enters Second Phase

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Azimuth Biotech has repeated its call for Guardian artefacts to be delivered to the HIP 22460 system.

Military coordinator Commodore Morag Halloran announced the details:

“Over the last week, many Commanders have scoured Guardian sites to collect artefacts and transport them to HIP 22460. We are grateful for their efforts, and payment is now available at the Bright Sentinel.”

“The Proteus Wave, currently being constructed aboard the megaship, requires increasing quantities of Guardian-based technology. Azimuth Biotech has confirmed the artefact acquisition initiative will continue for a second week and would like more pilots to take part.”

“Passage through the HIP 22460 system has become hazardous, with Thargoid vessels present in large numbers. The Allied, Federal and Imperial taskforces are striving to protect traders, as are independent AX fighters and squadrons. However, as the concentration of artefacts increases, it’s expected that the Thargoid presence will intensify. Pilots should remain on high alert while in the system.”

Guardian caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns can all be delivered to the Bright Sentinel megaship, which remains in stationary orbit above HIP 22460 10b.

## 13 JUL

### The Battle of HIP 22460

Vox Galactica has published an on-site account from the HIP 22460 system, where a coalition fleet is engaged in combat with the Thargoids.

“This is Jade Sanderlyn reporting for Vox Galactica. I’ve been in HIP 22460 over the past two weeks, and during this time the system has been transformed into a ferocious battleground.”

“Naval and independent craft are fighting side by side against the biomechanical nightmares that are Thargoid vessels. Many brave pilots have lost their lives to the aliens’ firepower, several of whom I spoke to only hours before. The official casualty numbers are climbing rapidly. But so far the coalition is holding the line.”

“The Bright Sentinel is at the eye of the storm, aboard which high concentrations of Guardian devices are being prepared for integration with the Proteus Wave device on HIP 22460 10b. We know little about this superweapon’s properties, considering its origins stem from the technology of a long-extinct civilisation. Perhaps only Salvation can claim such an understanding. But he is certainly not willing to share his unique knowledge, since it has placed all three superpowers at his beck and call.”

“Despite the constant danger, most personnel I’ve spoken to are optimistic. There is a sense of comradeship, of humanity working together against a common enemy. But among them are those who view Salvation as untrustworthy at best, and a mass murderer at worst. Some pilots have even mounted a resistance campaign against Azimuth, convinced that it is the cause of the Thargoids’ aggression rather than the solution.”

“This mirrors the results of a recent study by Orion University into public sentiment towards Salvation’s grand plan. The campaign in HIP 22460 enjoys general social network support from users fatigued by this years-long war, particularly following Salvation’s claims of complete victory. Others remain sceptical of Salvation, citing concerns over the Proteus Wave’s future as well as historical crimes committed by Azimuth personnel. A small demographic, recently given a voice by popular ICE creator Joy Senne, has suggested that Salvation’s influence has actively prevented efforts to communicate with the Thargoids, dashing hopes of a diplomatic solution to the conflict.”

“Could HIP 22460 really be the final battle of the Second Thargoid War? Many combat pilots here are convinced that Salvation can achieve this, and are willing to die for his cause. Right now, we can only wait and hope that their continued sacrifices are worthwhile.”

“This is Jade Sanderlyn for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there.”

## 14 JUL

### Support Federal Strike Against Crime Syndicate

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The Federation has offered bounties to hunt down all surviving Red Family ships in the Andowatye system.

Executive Agent Faisal Sacranie of the Federal Intelligence Agency released this statement:

“Information provided by the Proactive Detection Bureau revealed that the notorious Oberon Church has gathered his remaining followers in Andowatye. Our mission to take down the narcotics syndicate is not complete until its kingpin has been arrested and charged for his long list of crimes.”

“The FIA has authorised hiring independent pilots to act as auxiliaries for this operation. We are working closely with the United Andowatye Democrats, which has placed bounties on all wanted ships in this system.”

“It is crucial that our agents locate Oberon Church before he departs from the system. If we cannot eliminate his defenders in time, he may once again escape justice and re-establish his drugs empire from the shadows. We have a duty to all Federal citizens to prevent this from happening.”

The United Andowatye Democrats has confirmed that contributing pilots can redeem bounty vouchers at Bosch Station in the Andowatye system.

### Pilots Urged to Defend Proteus Wave Project

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

As the Thargoid presence increases in the HIP 22460 system, Azimuth Biotech and the superpowers call for reinforcements.

An urgent bulletin was transmitted from Commodore Morag Halloran aboard the Bright Sentinel:

“A series of actions by ‘Operation Wych Hunt’ saboteurs have resulted in delays to Azimuth Biotech’s supply infrastructure. As a result of these traitorous acts, we have been forced to amend the construction timetable for the Proteus Wave.”

“Salvation informs me that it will be approximately two more weeks until the weapon is fully assembled. This delay increases the Proteus Wave’s exposure to Thargoid intervention, potentially undermining the project. But we remain convinced that the majority of pilots are committed to ensuring a human victory.”

“After discussions with Admiral Atherton, Admiral Price and Admiral Ziegler, the coalition has agreed to provide funding for increased defences in HIP 22460. For the next two weeks, independent pilots can claim reimbursement for the hazardous task of engaging the Thargoids.”

“Thargoid combat bonds can be handed in at the Musashi megaship in the nearby Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system. The most dedicated Commanders by contribution will be rewarded with Salvation’s pre-engineered Guardian gauss cannons.”

## 15 JUL

### Azimuth’s Plan Elicits Further Reactions

Prominent figures on the political stage have commented on Salvation’s anti-xeno operation in the HIP 22460 system. Key points from each are collated below.

Archon Delaine: “My opinion on the Thargoids remains the same: burn them all! As I stated at the Galactic Summit, the Kumo nation stands ready to help wipe out these alien scum.”

Yuri Grom: “I trust Salvation as little as I trust the Federation. What guarantee do we have that this Proteus Wave will not be turned against human targets, once the Thargoids are dealt with?”

Senator Zemina Torval: “Azimuth Biotech has emerged as a strategically significant corporation. I’ve advised the Imperial Senate to establish long-term commercial links that are mutually beneficial.”

Hadrian Augustus Duval: “The Thargoids are a genuine threat. Yet I hope that our military collaboration with the Alliance and the Federation is a temporary measure only. The Empire must develop the strength to stand alone.”

First Minister Octavia Volkov: “Thargoid attack is an ever-present danger for the Marlinist Colonies. We are observing events closely. Personally I do not view Azimuth as a trustworthy ally.”

Ambassador Jasmina Halsey: “I’m pleased to see the Federation working closely with the Alliance, but disappointed that it is limited to anti-xeno matters. Whatever happens in HIP 22460, we should grasp this opportunity to increase diplomatic as well as military cooperation.”

## 18 JUL

### The Xenocide Debate

As construction proceeds on Salvation’s Proteus Wave, there is widespread dispute on the issue of eliminating the Thargoids.

An article by Heimar Borichev, deputy editor of The Sovereign newsfeed, has divided public opinion:

“Salvation’s latest superweapon is designed to attract and then destroy members of the species we’ve named ‘Thargoids’. If successful, it would wipe them from the core systems entirely. But there are a number of questions that nobody seems to be asking, including this: do we have the right to take such action?”

“What’s that, you say? The Thargoids are the aggressors, out to destroy humanity? Or are they just defending historical territory from our expanding presence? Remember, they were navigating space a million years before we were. If a new species suddenly emerged on our worlds and began strip-mining our lands, how would we react?”

“Now, I’m not suggesting we should pledge ourselves to the Far God cult and start praying to Thargoids. But how much of the considerable military budget spent on this interspecies war could have been saved by a simple conversation? Has anyone genuinely attempted to communicate with them? If we’d been more focused on diplomacy instead of extermination, we might have found a way to parley with the Thargoids by now. How many lives could have been saved if our two races had exchanged a few words?”

“I maintain there is no justification for xenocide. This whole war is as manufactured as our name for these beings. Ask yourself why the superpowers would like you to believe they’re fighting monsters who can’t be reasoned with. Ask yourself how this benefits the politicians, the corporations, weapons manufacturers, security forces. Ask yourself who the real monsters are.”

## 19 JUL

### Azimuth’s Final Call for Guardian Artefacts

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The campaign to deliver Guardian artefacts to Azimuth Biotech in the HIP 22460 system has reached its third phase.

Commodore Morag Halloran outlined the final stage of the initiative:

“We have received an impressive number of Guardian caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns at the Bright Sentinel over the past two weeks. Thanks to this supply, construction of the Proteus Wave has progressed satisfactorily.”

“However, Salvation has requested that further shipments of artefacts are sourced from Guardian sites. There can be no shortfall of these vital components, and the superweapon will make use of every one we can provide.”

“We have projected a substantial increase in the number of Thargoid vessels within HIP 22460, as they react to the increased concentration of technology created by their ancient enemies. AX fighters and squadrons are asked to continue engaging the enemy’s forces to provide safe passage for incoming transports.”

Pilots who previously contributed to this initiative can collect rewards from the Bright Sentinel megaship in HIP 22460, which is continuing to accept new shipments of Guardian artefacts.

## 21 JUL

### Proteus Wave Approaches Completion

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

New Federal and Imperial capital ships have arrived in HIP 22460 as Azimuth Biotech’s operation nears its conclusion.

The following message was provided to all newsfeeds for public broadcast:

“This is Salvation. The Proteus Wave’s core mechanism will be fully constructed one week from today. We will then begin integration with the surface site on HIP 22460 10b, using designs of mine which are unique to the superweapon’s operation.”

“As anticipated, the Thargoid presence in the HIP 22460 system has escalated considerably. Providing the sufficient majority of their fleet is within range of the Proteus Wave, the casualties will be devastating enough to drive the Thargoids out of the core systems forever.”

“I urge all superpower-affiliated and independent ships to hold the line. Only through determination and sacrifice will we finish our crucial work.”

In HIP 22460, the Federal Navy and Imperial Navy have each deployed additional capital ships as the conflict has grown in scale and ferocity. These huge vessels are directing large-scale firepower against the Thargoids.

Independent pilots are also being incentivised to destroy the alien vessels, with opportunities to obtain Salvation’s pre-engineered Guardian gauss cannons. Thargoid combat bonds can be redeemed at the Musashi in the nearby Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system.

Azimuth Biotech’s campaign for Guardian artefacts, which form the most vital components of the Proteus Wave, is now in its final phase. Deliveries can be made to the Bright Sentinel megaship in HIP 22460 until Tuesday the 26th of July.

### Criminals Crushed by Federal Campaign

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

A Federal operation in the Andowatye system has finally brought down the Red Family crime syndicate.

Executive Agent Faisal Sacranie of the Federal Intelligence Agency announced the successful conclusion:

“I am pleased to confirm that FIA agents were able to capture Oberon Church, the so-called ‘man of smoke’, as well as his surviving lieutenants. With its kingpin’s arrest and most remaining forces destroyed, the Red Family organisation no longer exists as a functional crime organisation.”

“On behalf of the FIA, I am grateful to all pilots who helped eliminate these felons. The United Andowatye Democrats will redeem bounty vouchers for all contributors at Bosch Station in the Andowatye system.”

Vice President Jerome Archer gave a statement to The Federal Times:

“One of the Federation’s most notorious organised crime networks has been eradicated, largely due to vital information obtained by the Proactive Detection Bureau. Its ability to unearth enemies of the Federation and bring them to justice remains unparalleled.”

The Proactive Detection Bureau was created when Vice President Archer successfully passed public surveillance legislation in 3307. Political commentators have theorised that Archer’s presidential campaign next year will stress the PDB’s role in high-profile victories such as the defeat of Jupiter’s Wrath and Red Family.

## 22 JUL

### The View from the Front Line

Vox Galactica reporter Jade Sanderlyn has broadcast an update on the conflict taking place in the HIP 22460 system.

“The fierce fighting in HIP 22460 has intensified over the past week. Swarms of Thargoid vessels can be encountered throughout the system, cutting down any ill-prepared ships within range. The combined human forces are battling furiously to diminish the alien fleet.”

“A total of seven capital ships, all armed with experimental weaponry, are now providing support for AX squadrons. I’ve been mesmerised by the intense volleys of energy beams that flash from these gigantic craft, seeking out the dark-hulled Thargoids as they swoop and spin with an eerie grace. Distance offers these sights a strange beauty, a distraction from the ugly fact that many lives are lost with each skirmish.”

“It appears the Alliance’s military pact with Sirius Corporation is starting to gain traction. The megaship El Centinela Cadejo recently arrived in Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 from Arimpox, providing logistical support for the Alliance Defence Force in HIP 22460. My military contacts inform me that Azimuth Biotech had sought to restrict Sirius Corporation vessels from participating in the Proteus Wave campaign, perhaps fearful of corporate espionage. Li Yong-Rui would approve of the rather deliberate choice to move El Centinela Cadejo to the same system as Azimuth’s Musashi and Glorious Prospect megaships.”

“Meanwhile, the hellish situation in HIP 22460 rages on. I’ve reported from several battlefields, but this one is something of an endurance test. Every day I watch squadrons deploy to a conflict, and every day watch them return with fewer vessels. All I can do is hope that this carnage will eventually lead to something worthwhile.”

“This is Jade Sanderlyn for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there.”

## 25 JUL

### Azimuth Condemns ‘Alien-Loving’ Resistance

As its anti-xeno initiative in HIP 22460 continues, Azimuth Biotech has been deliberately targeted by protestors in other systems.

Director Torben Rademaker, head of strategic operations, made a public broadcast from the corporation’s headquarters at Hind Mine starport:

“Azimuth Biotech is dedicated to the vision of Salvation, whose expertise will soon quash the Thargoid blight once and for all. The Alliance, Empire and Federation have put aside their differences to turn this ambition into a reality. But a fractious minority are determined to prevent this, giving the Thargoids a window of opportunity to avoid their fate.”

“Almost immediately after our corporate rebrand from Taurus Mining Ventures, Azimuth came under attack. A rabble of buccaneers and political agitators forcibly expelled our assets from the Merope and Qarato systems. Only by extreme and costly means were we able to retain Hind Mine, as the mob rampaged through the once-peaceful T Tauri system.”

“Their appalling acts have not only endangered Azimuth Biotech’s long-term financial growth, but also delayed the manufacture of the Proteus Wave in HIP 22460. Perhaps ‘Operation Wych Hunt’ is made up of deranged Far God cultists, since they seem hell-bent on sabotaging humanity’s greatest defence against the Thargoids.”

“Naturally, Azimuth Biotech has petitioned the relevant authorities to take appropriate action. We are also reaching out to any independent pilots who supported Salvation’s past projects. To these loyal to his cause, I implore you to defend our noble enterprise. Show these alien-loving traitors that they are on the wrong side of history.”

## 26 JUL

### Guardian Artefact Campaign Concludes

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The third phase of an initiative to acquire Guardian artefacts for the Proteus Wave has ended successfully.

Commodore Morag Halloran, Azimuth Biotech’s military coordinator, announced:

“Salvation has asked me to extend his sincere thanks to all pilots for exploring ancient Guardian sites and transporting their discoveries to the Bright Sentinel in HIP 22460. The quantity of artefacts delivered over the past three weeks has surpassed our targets.”

“The most recent shipments are now being ferried down to the surface of HIP 22460 10b. The Proteus Wave’s core mechanism is mere days away from being fully assembled. Calibration tests will then begin within the Thargoid structure, which will vastly amplify the superweapon’s disruptive frequencies.”

“It is now mission critical to defend the project. The Thargoids appear frenzied by the system’s concentration of Guardian technology, which is drawing their vessels in ever-greater numbers. I am liaising closely with the Allied, Federal and Imperial taskforces, but we require even more volunteers to provide tactical support to their capital ships.”

With the delivery initiative concluded, contributing pilots can now collect their rewards from the Bright Sentinel megaship in the HIP 22460 system.

## 27 JUL

### Tesreau Highlights Azimuth’s ‘Inhumanity’

A counter-statement regarding Azimuth Biotech has been published by Professor Alba Tesreau, former head of research at Aegis.

“The recent declaration by Director Torben Rademaker paints a false picture of those pilots who are actively working against Azimuth Biotech. He frames them as criminals and alien sympathisers, betraying humanity to the Thargoids. This could not be any further from the truth. It is Azimuth’s own inhumanity that they are fighting against.”

“It’s unsurprising that Salvation’s focus is now on HIP 22460, given this system has long been part of Azimuth’s sinister legacy. On planet 7c is the abandoned settlement Fort Asch, where unlicensed scientists performed monstrous experiments to link human minds with Thargoid vessels. We know from Project Seraph’s sole survivor, known as Subject D-2, how brutal the results were.”

“Alongside the Bright Sentinel above planet 10b is the Overlook, a derelict megaship drifting within a caustic cloud of debris. Some may have assumed it is the scene of a recent Thargoid attack, but in fact it once served as the headquarters of Black Flight. This secretive organisation arranged strike teams to suppress evidence of the Thargoids from the general public. Azimuth’s collaboration with Black Flight helped it establish a monopoly on xenological research.”

“For the past two centuries, Azimuth has ruthlessly sought to obtain and weaponise alien technology. The crew of the Alexandria were sacrificed in order to steal Guardian material for its superweapon. Now that same genocidal device, paid for with the blood of thousands, is being hailed as a ‘noble enterprise’.”

“Caleb Wycherley has reinvented himself as Salvation, but his modern persona cannot conceal his malignant nature. Those who Rademaker accused of betrayal are in fact driven by conscience and a sense of justice. I call upon the leaders of the Alliance, Empire and Federation to follow their example, and withdraw support for this nefarious organisation.”

## 28 JUL

### Thargoid Salvage Operation Requires Resources

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Azimuth Biotech has called for commodities to be delivered to the Glorious Prospect in the Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system.

Director Torben Rademaker, head of strategic operations, outlined the new initiative:

“Once the Proteus Wave has eliminated the Thargoids, the second phase of our corporate strategy will commence. As per our agreement with the Alliance, Empire and Federation, Azimuth Biotech is licensed to collect limited quantities of any remaining non-human material in the HIP 22460 system. The powerless Thargoid vessels will be taken to specialised laboratories for examination, and the subsequent results shared with the superpowers’ military intelligence divisions.”

“Unfortunately, Azimuth has experienced significant losses in several systems, as a result of actions taken by ‘Operation Wych Hunt’ saboteurs. This has prevented us from setting up research labs and analytical equipment, delaying our xeno-retrieval programme considerably.”

“To counteract this setback, we require shipments of HN shock mounts, micro controllers and radiation baffles. The Glorious Prospect megaship stands ready in the Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system to receive these deliveries.”

As well as credit payments, Azimuth Biotech has agreed to make pre-engineered Guardian shard cannons available as an additional reward for pilots who transport the greatest volume of commodities.

## 29 JUL

### Superweapon Construction Completed

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Work on the Proteus Wave in the HIP 22460 system has concluded, according to an announcement from Azimuth Biotech.

“This is Salvation. The core mechanism of the Proteus Wave is now fully assembled. Under my guidance, specialists are performing checks at the selected site on HIP 22460 10 b. Additional power capacitors are also being installed to improve energy transfer management.”

“Over the next few days, the Proteus Wave will be calibrated within one of the Thargoid structures, the unique properties of which will greatly amplify the weapon’s signal. This breakthrough was only made possible due to decades of xenological research conducted by Azimuth, alongside pioneering theories on cross-species interfaces.”

“Commodore Halloran reports that even greater numbers of Thargoid vessels have arrived within the Proteus Wave’s effective range. But it is now absolutely critical that they are prevented from approaching the planet. At all costs, the superweapon must be protected until it is ready for activation.”

The Allied, Federal and Imperial anti-xeno taskforces continue to engage Thargoid forces within the HIP 22460 system. Volunteers are still urgently needed to support their capital ships and take part in defending the Proteus Wave project. The Musashi, an Azimuth megaship in the nearby Pleiades Sector CW-U B3-2 system, will redeem all Thargoid combat bonds.
