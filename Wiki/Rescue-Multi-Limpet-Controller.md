The **Rescue Multi Limpet Controller** is a Limpet Controller that can program limpets with the Fuel Transfer, Hatch Breaker, or Repair functions as needed. Although it is more flexible than the specialised modules it combines, it is only available in a small size, is less efficient, and a greater mass but is offset by its 3 uses in one.

## Usage

The Rescue Multi Limpet Controller combines the functions of the Fuel Transfer Limpet Controller, Hatch Breaker Limpet Controller, and Repair Limpet Controller into a single module, making it well-suited for search and rescue activities. The convenience of this is offset by the module's lack of size options, preventing it from being equipped on any ships that do not possess a Class 3 or larger Internal Compartment, and its increased mass. Each of the three module functions also only perform as well as their equivalent Class 1 specialised modules.
