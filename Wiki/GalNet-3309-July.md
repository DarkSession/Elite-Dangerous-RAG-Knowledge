### Imperial Mother in Medical Emergency

Lady Florence Lavigny, the mother of Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval, has been placed under medical supervision following a sudden illness.

An official statement was released by the Imperial Palace:

“*The Imperial Mother, Lady Florence Lavigny, has suffered an unexpected medical emergency. She is being cared for by a specialist team at her Lake Parisot estate on the planet Topaz . Details of her illness are not being shared at this time.*”

“*Her Majesty the Emperor has cancelled all appointments and travelled to be at her mother’s side. The latest report states that Lady Lavigny has undergone surgical treatment and is in a poor but stable condition. We know that all citizens will join us in wishing the best for this prominent member of the Imperial Family.*”

Royal correspondent Gudrun Vestergaard provided some background to the story:

“*The Duvals always ensure that each Emperor’s parents are afforded the greatest respect, not to mention the finest medical care. Although the Imperial Mother’s ailment remains unspecified, not many fear it to be fatal at this early stage.*”

“*Though Lady Lavigny’s engagement to the late Emperor Hengist Duval brought the highest of profiles, she has typically sought to avoid the spotlight. Despite this, she has repeatedly been in the eye of a media storm. In 3250, her husband Prince Aristide de Lavigny met with a mysterious accident that was never fully explained. Decades later, it was revealed that their daughter Arissa had been sired by Emperor Hengist. Upon being selected by the Senate in 3301, Arissa adopted the new surname of Lavigny-Duval to reflect her previously unknown royal heritage.*”

“*Princess Aisling Duval, Archduke Otto Lombardo-Duval, Countess Guinevere Lavigny and many other Imperial Family members have all sent their hopes for a rapid recovery. A similar message came from Hadrian Augustus Duval, in an apparent attempt to rebuild bridges after his recent public spat with the Emperor. As the descendant of another of Hengist’s affairs, perhaps Hadrian feels more of a kinship with Florence Lavigny than most others in the Duval dynasty.*”

### Kokoller Mining Initiative Concludes

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

A mining campaign organised by Kokoller Limited has drawn to a close, with the organisers declaring it a success.

The Federal corporation requested deliveries of bertrandite, coltan and praseodymium to supply the Kokoller system’s refinery base, ostensibly to manufacture supplies for the Federal Navy’s anti-xeno war efforts.

Spokesperson Paul Dyson provided a message to participants:

“*It is genuinely a pleasure to see so many pilots respond to our call for raw materials. Harvesting those asteroid belts is no easy task, but the performance has been remarkable. I can promise all those involved in the campaign that the profits raised from refining and distributing these resources will go to a very worthy cause. Those credits are in good hands.*”

Kokoller Limited has confirmed that all contributors to the campaign can now collect their rewards from Utley Hub in the Kokoller system.

### Azimuth Plans Corporate Convention

Azimuth Biotech has announced an invitation-only event for prospective business partners and military liaisons.

CEO Torben Rademaker provided a statement to the media:

“*New opportunities have emerged for Azimuth to resume the lead in anti-xeno operations. With Thargoid fleets rampaging through the core systems, and Aegis’s questionable policy of providing utility modules over increased firepower, humanity’s defence once again falls to us. But our organisation will no longer work in solitude.*”

“*I have extended the hand of partnership to selected financiers, military figures, research groups and manufacturing companies. They are invited to convene and discuss methods of helping us to resist the evil of the Thargoids.*”

Business analyst Marlon Royce published this report via Vox Galactica:

“*Ostensibly, this appears to be a public relations exercise for Azimuth Biotech. However, the company’s relative lack of support from independent pilots in a recent Thargoid tissue sample initiative has accelerated the company’s search for allies. Rumours among the tech community hint that the convention precedes the announcement of a weapon schematic redesign to whet the appetite of investors.*”

“*Azimuth is using private couriers to transport guests to and from the convention, entirely at its own expense. This generous professional courtesy also guarantees anonymity for attendees, making it difficult to determine who is on Rademaker’s guest list. Given nerves over Operation Wych Hunt disruption, this seems a wise choice.*”

“*We do know that Herculean Machines and Space Lanes Cargo are sending representatives. Aanya Gupta, CEO of Holloway Bioscience Institute, also agreed to meet with the rival xeno-researcher. But the rest are avoiding being publicly associated with Azimuth Biotech, which faced enormous criticism for its role in the Battle of HIP 22460 and the Thargoids’ subsequent retaliation.*”

### Deliver Rarities for Azimuth Event

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Azimuth Biotech has requested shipments of rare commodities to Xi Wangda, as luxury supplies for its business convention.

Torben Rademaker, CEO of the anti-xeno corporation, announced the initiative via public channels:

“*We expect this prestigious gathering to be attended by many representatives from research groups, manufacturing companies and military forces. To ensure that our esteemed guests are made welcome, we will pay handsomely for shipments of Albino Quechua Mammoth Meat, Gilya Signature Weapons and Harma Silver Sea Rum*”.

“*The cornerstone of this event will be the commercial launch of Azimuth’s newly modified ship-mounted weapon: the pre-engineered Overcharged Gimballed AX Multi-Cannon with Auto Loader. Our proprietary redesign will make a significant contribution when engaging Thargoid vessels in combat. Those who contribute the greatest number of rare goods will be rewarded with some of these revolutionary modules.*”

Deputy Prime Minister Angela Corcoran, who coordinates the Alliance’s involvement with Aegis, remarked on Azimuth’s campaign during an interview for the Old Worlds Gazette:

“*Anything that increases survivability against the Thargoids is surely welcome. But it does grind a little when it comes from the same organisation that escalated the war so significantly.*”

“*Furthermore, Mr Rademaker is placing a positive spin on Azimuth’s connections with third parties, rather than admit that it is a necessity. Activist groups such as Operation Wych Hunt have diminished the corporation’s stellar influence in recent months. Their actions might have forced Azimuth to rely on external support in order to compete with Aegis.*”

Pilots can make their deliveries to Musashi in the Xi Wangda system. Azimuth Biotech has acknowledged that transporting these valuable items increases the likelihood of being targeted by pirate forces. The corporation will therefore offer a further reward for redeeming bounty vouchers at Cartier City on wanted ships in the system, in order to maintain local security.

### Presidential Candidates Outline Manifestos

The three candidates in the Federal presidential election have taken part in a second live debate to discuss policies.

The event was more closely moderated than the first debate in June. The candidates discussed their campaigns in detail, with minimal interruption from their rivals.

Republican Party candidate Jerome Archer is the current vice president and a former director of the Federal Intelligence Agency. He explained his intentions to tighten security and increase military spending:

“Shielding citizens from external threats, whether human or alien, is always my top priority. Ms Winters lacks any significant achievements in her political career, if we’re honest. Whereas I can refer to many successes – such as the Proactive Detection Bureau – which prove I am a man of my word.”

Shadow President Felicia Winters, leader of the Liberal Party, was previously the secretary of state in Jasmina Halsey’s administration. She outlined her plans to reinvest in civil infrastructure by increasing corporate taxation:

“Our economic model will look to increase tax revenue generated by large corporations, greatly improving the quality of life for billions of people through public service investment. Mr Archer’s obsession with police-state programmes can only push the Federation further toward an authoritarian dystopia.”

Independent candidate Zachary Rackham is a well-known business magnate, who privately owns many Federal companies. His campaign pledges have proved highly popular, but remain light on detail:

“Is anyone else as bored of these two windbags as I am? All politicians do is make empty promises, but I’m in the business of giving people what they want. As president, I’ll make every single person rich and successful, just like – say it with me, come on – just like me!”

All three candidates pledged to prioritise funding for the Federal Navy’s anti-xeno efforts until the ongoing conflict with the Thargoids reaches a conclusion.

In related news, Congress confirmed that the election date has been shifted again. Refugee advocacy groups have argued that all residents of Federal systems lost to Thargoid invasion are entitled to vote, and the active re-registration of this demographic in new territories has forced a further delay. The election is now expected to be held in the last quarter of 3309.

### Azimuth Releases New AX Weapon

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Rare goods delivered to Xi Wangda helped ensure that Azimuth Biotech’s arms convention was a success.

CEO Torben Rademaker confirmed the initiative’s completion:

“From today, the Overcharged Gimballed AX Multi-Cannon with Auto Loader is available at all rescue megaships, as well as Azimuth Biotech’s core markets. I am confident that this will prove useful those brave pilots who enter combat with Thargoid ships. Once again, my company has proved that its ingenuity and experience in developing anti-xeno weaponry cannot be surpassed.”

“I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to all of the corporate, financial and military representatives who attended the convention. Many fascinating proposals were discussed, most of which must remain commercially confidential for now. Suffice to say, the future for Azimuth Biotech and our partners looks bright.”

“Finally, the event was helped enormously by the supplies of Albino Quechua Mammoth Meat, Gilya Signature Weapons and Harma Silver Sea Rum, as well as those who eliminated criminal elements in the Xi Wangda system. I have authorised reimbursement for delivered goods from Musashi and bounty vouchers from Cartier City.”

Newsfeeds, business analysts and ICE channels have discussed the clandestine nature of Azimuth Biotech’s convention. Some wondered if the corporation would be able to function without external financing. Others suggested that cooperation with mainstream companies may rehabilitate Azimuth in the eyes of the superpowers.

The attendance of senior staff from the Holloway Bioscience Institute has also raised eyebrows within the scientific community. An editorial in The Empirical remarked: “Holloway’s expertise in studying vacuum-dwelling life forms is almost unparalleled. If Azimuth were to forge closer ties with the institute, the resulting xenological research capabilities might even surpass those of Aegis.”

### The Hunt for the Dedicant

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Traces of a distress call from the Dedicant megaship have been detected in the LP 714-58 system.

Vice Admiral Amir Rafiq, a spokesperson for the Imperial Navy, broadcast an announcement on all public channels:

“An Imperial scout ship travelling through LP 714-58 has intercepted several fragmentary signals. Their identifying markers confirmed that they originated from the Dedicant. We believe there has been an encryption error in the system’s communication beacons, which prevented the distress call from being rerouted to its intended destination in the Federation.”

“Officially, the Imperial Navy no longer performs joint operations with our Federal counterparts. Nor do we involve ourselves in the activities of the illegal Far God cult. Nevertheless, we are sharing this information as a humanitarian gesture. Our hope is that this may aid a rescue mission for those trapped aboard the lost megaship.”

The Dedicant made an unscheduled hyperspace jump from the Popontia system on the 15th of June, while imprisoned members of the Order of the Far God were being transferred onboard to be relocated in the Alliance.

Executive Agent Jalen Locke of the Federal Intelligence Agency released a statement:

“It is unexpected to receive any kind of assistance from the Empire, but on this occasion we are grateful. Three security teams, comprised of 50 agents each, are currently on the Dedicant along with over 8,000 cultists. This is the first indication that the megaship remains intact and that our people are calling for help.”

“FIA specialists are en route to the LP 714-58 system. However, deciphering interstellar comms signals is a difficult and time-consuming task. We would appreciate any assistance from independent pilots if they are able to detect any further messages.”

### Dedicant Quest Yields Results

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The missing megaship Dedicant is close to being located after fragments of its distress call were tracked down.

The scrambled messages were discovered on comms beacons in the LP 714-58, Wuniez, Olurung and Kwakimo systems. Combined decryption efforts eventually led to another beacon in the HIP 19912 system, where the Dedicant’s original transmission was revealed:

FEDERAL ESCORT TEAM ALPHA

ASSIGNED TO ORDER OF THE FAR GOD MEGASHIP ‘DEDICANT’

PRISONER TRANSFER MISSION HAS FAILED

SIGNIFICANT NON-LETHAL DEFENSIVE MEASURES ENCOUNTERED

MAJORITY OF ORDER OF THE FAR GOD PRISONERS ESCAPED

PRISONERS INITIATED DEDICANT HYPERDRIVE

ESCORT TEAMS ALPHA, BRAVO, CHARLIE AND CULTISTS REMAIN ON BOARD

‘DEDICANT’ CURRENT LOCATION UNKNOWN

ADVISE TRACING METADATA COORDINATES TO THIS MESSAGE

REQUEST IMMEDIATE FEDERAL NAVY ASSISTANCE

Vice Admiral Amir Rafiq of the Imperial Navy provided an update:

“Imperial Intelligence specialists are currently analysing the comms beacon in HIP 19912 to trace the message to its point of origin. We have orders not to commence any joint operations with the Federation, but I am authorised to make our findings public.”

Executive Agent Jalen Locke of the Federal Intelligence Agency told the media:

“We appreciate the assistance from the Empire , and from all the independent pilots who helped find this distress call. It has confirmed our theory that the prisoners managed to regain control of their former vessel, using various modifications made to its internal systems.”

“FIA security teams are standing by to launch a rescue mission as and when the Dedicant’s location is pinpointed. They will retake the megaship by force if necessary and detain all Far God cultists onboard.”

### Thargoid War Update: July 3309

Vox Galactica journalist Jade Sanderlyn reports on the latest news emerging from the front lines of the conflict.

“Events in the war continue to move quickly, sometimes outpacing the ‘speed of news’. In my last update, I mentioned that the Thargoids had occupied over a thousand systems. But by the time that was published, the number had reduced considerably. According to my sources, anti-xeno squadrons and independent pilots are reclaiming systems at a higher rate than Thargoids can conquer them.”

“This incredible achievement suggests we are finally gaining the advantage in this war. The hopelessness that many have felt over the last nine months is now tempered with optimism. Our naval forces are proving that the alien fleet is not undefeatable.”

“My sources also passed on some unsettling stories from pilots working beyond the frontline systems. A few of them seem to think that the Thargoids’ interest in occupied escape pods – which is well documented – has recently increased. Apparently, there have been claims that Thargoid vessels went out of their way to abduct escape pods launched from ships damaged in battle.”

“These are little more than unsubstantiated rumours, of course, and not something I would usually include in a factual report. But we know so little about the Thargoids that even circumstantial changes in their behaviour might be significant. And I can’t be the only one who finds such tales chilling.”

“Otherwise, the most significant news this month was Azimuth Biotech’s corporate convention and the launch of its AX module redesign. Aegis clearly has the lead in both public sentiment and government support at this time, but it seems like Azimuth has no intention of ceasing its contributions to the war effort anytime soon.”

“This is Jade Sanderlyn for Vox Galactica. Stay safe out there.”
