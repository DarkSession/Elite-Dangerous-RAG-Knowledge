The **Pacifier Frag-Cannon** is a large Fragment Cannon variant that gains tighter spread and longer range at the cost of reduced damage per shot. This weapon is a merit reward in Powerplay.

## Usage

The Pacifier Frag-Cannon is available only for a Class 3 fixed hardpoint. Like the Fragment Cannon, it can rapidly fire three shots of 12 projectiles before having to reload. Compared to the Class 3 fixed Fragment Cannon, it is almost identical but has 150% projectile speed, 150% maximum range, and a jitter of 1.7 degrees compared to 5.0 degrees; damage also does not drop off until the furthest edge of its maximum range. These attributes together make it far more likely to cause more damage at further ranges. If the Fragment Cannon is a futuristic shotgun, then the Pacifier is a shotgun with a choke.

For this increased range it sacrifices damage per each projectile, and so does 87% of the full theoretical DPS of the equivalent fragment cannon. This makes it comparatively poorer at the point blank ranges preferred by many pilots using fragment cannons. It also cannot be gimballed, potentially a drawback for a Class 3 weapon hardpoint which is usually found on bigger, less nimble ships.
