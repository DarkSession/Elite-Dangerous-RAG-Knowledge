## Overview

The Karma L-6 brings massive firepower to any ground battle. Its unguided explosive rounds can inflict deadly splash damage if they strike a target, and can come in handy against SRVs. This lethality comes with drawbacks, however. The L-6 can only carry two rounds in its magazine at a time, and is slow and cumbersome to reload or swap with another weapon, especially in the heat of combat. Worse, L-6 rounds cannot penetrate shields, and in some cases can be deflected away by shields, allowing a target to survive what would otherwise have been a fatal hit. It is recommended to equip a laser weapon to strip enemy shields before switching to the L-6 to deal the finishing blow.
