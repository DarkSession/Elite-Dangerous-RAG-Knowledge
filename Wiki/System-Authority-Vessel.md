# System Authority Vessel
System Authority Vessels destroying a target
 		 	 

A **System Authority Vessel** enforces the law, protects property, and limits civil disorder in a star system. They can be found at signal sources such as a Nav Beacon or a Resource Extraction Site, and at ports. Anarchy systems do not have System Authority Vessels.

System Authority Vessels can interdict other ships to scan for bounties and stolen or illegal commodities, and shooting them, even accidentally, is a criminal act. If a System Authority Vessel detects either bounties or illegal items, it will attack the offender, and if the offender destroys it, more System Authority Vessels will soon arrive at the scene. In the event that System Authority Vessels are unable to defeat an especially notorious criminal, Advanced Tactical Response units will be deployed.

These vessels are identified as *"Federal Security Service"* in the Federal space, *"Internal Security Service"* in the Imperial space, *"Allied Police Forces*" in the Alliance space and simply *"System Authority Vessel"* in independent systems.
