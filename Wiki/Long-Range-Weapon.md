# Long Range Weapon
**Long Range Weapon** is an engineer modification that can be applied to weapons. It increases overall range and increases damage falloff starting point to the weapon's maximum range (so the weapon suffers no damage falloff at all) the cost of increased power draw and increased mass. It also increases projectile velocity for Cannons and Plasma Accelerators.

It is available in 5 grades, with the highest grade offering up to 100% increase in range, falloff, and projectile velocity (if applicable).
