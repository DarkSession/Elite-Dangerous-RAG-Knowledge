## Overview

The **Anti-Xeno Initiative** was founded by *CMDR Gluttony Fang* on 15th of November 3303. They are the largest dedicated AX (Anti-Xeno) player group in Elite Dangerous and act as a hub for the broader AX Community. They are partnered with Canonn Interstellar Research, who provide us with the latest findings related to our mission. They also coordinate defense efforts with other player groups to protect as many lives as They can. They  constantly strive to get better at what they do and tThey have some of the best Anti-Xeno experts among us.

## Members

The membership in AXI is non-binding, meaning you can also be a part of any other player group you wish. They have people of all walks of life and all matter of allegiance. They are a completely independent and apolitical - they do not support or oppose any faction, power or group, unless they force our hand. That said, they protect our members. They have a sizable contingent of PvP pilots to repel any attempts at disrupting our primary mission.

- The Thargoids have returned in great force pushing large incursions into multiple human-occupied systems. Commanders abroad have been requested to aid with the defence, rescue and logistical efforts. In response to this latest push in Thargoid activity, the Anti-Xeno Initiative has commissioned a new tracking and monitoring system to allow commanders to keep up-to-date with the latest movements and presence statuses of incursion systems.
