In 2005, the U.S.S. Protector, a Federation starship of the Prometheus class, left the legendary Utopia Planitia shipyards for the first time and flew towards the future.

The chat role-playing game impressed the seven players at that time with a captivating, cinematic story whose plot thread would culminate in a spectacular finale in January 2015. Under the name Stellanebula Project, additional projects such as the Earth Network radio magazine, a novel series, and an audio drama were created. While the audio drama, the novel series, and the radio show were eventually discontinued, the Star Trek Online fleet of the project was founded on Star date 89736.37 (17.02.2012).

On November 1, 2019, the Elite Dangerous Squadron SNPX was founded by a group of explorers, adventurers, and entrepreneurs alike. It is based on the core principles that every member must be treated equally, and that strength lies in group efforts and mutual respect. To explore the galaxy as a team, the squadron carrier SNPX Phoenix was built.

Stellanebula Project was, is, and will always be more than "just a fleet" or "just a role-playing game." Stellanebula Project is a community of people who have fun together and journey towards a better future together. Friendships are formed here.
