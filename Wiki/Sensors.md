**Sensors** passively scan the surrounding area for other ships and objects of interest and displays the data on the ship's Scanner. Upgrading a ship's Sensors will increase their optimal range which will allow more distant ships and objects to be displayed on the Scanner.

Given that the gains on range for A, B, and C-rated Sensors are not comparative to the cost in terms of credits, added mass, and power draw, and E-rated Sensors have the same mass as A and C, D-rated Sensors are preferred by most pilots since they have the lowest mass.

## Engineer modifications

The following modifications can be applied to this module by Engineers to enhance its abilities:

- Lightweight
- Long range
- Wide angle

## Notes

- As Sensors are a core module, they may not be completely removed.
- Breaking Sensors will prevent Gimballed and Turreted weapons from functioning since Sensors provide the ship's targeting capability.
- Exploration - you may wish to disable your sensors when managing power to get the most out of your exploration ship. If disabled you will detect no ships on your scanner while you're flying through the system in Supercruise. If disabled you will not be able to contact (and therefore dock) with stations. Both of these can be managed with some quick finger disabling / enabling of ship modules on the fly.
- The tool tip for Sensors is misleading: there is absolutely no correlation between Sensors' class or rating and aiming.
- Frontier Developments once planned to give Sensors an additional purpose by linking them more closely to Gimballed and Turreted weapons, so that Sensor quality would determine the effectiveness of these weapons' targeting capability, but these plans did not pass the beta stage and were not implemented.
