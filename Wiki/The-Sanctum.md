**The Sanctum** is an abandoned settlement located on planet 4 A in the Etain system. It was one of two compounds in Etain that belonged to the Far God cult, the other being The Prophet, and was constructed sometime in 3304 as a "void-temple" where cult members could hide from persecution and place themselves in cryogenic stasis to await the prophesied arrival of the Far God, which the cult believed had been heralded by the return of the Thargoids. The compound was later attacked by the Thargoids, who either killed or abducted the cultists. The Sanctum was subsequently discovered by independent pilots on August 30, 3304, when Eagle Eye detected Thargoid signals in Etain.

## Logs

The Sanctum contains the first four of a series of nine audio logs; the last five can be found at The Prophet.

| 1/9 | ORDER OF THE FAR GOD, LOG 1/9
<br>Personal Log<br>Thaddeus MacRaith<br>First Herald of the Second Chapter<br><br><br>I greet you in the name of the Far God. Know that our galaxy lies in the shadow of this omniscient and most holy being. What the ignorant refer to as Thargoids are in truth the heralds of the Far God, preparing us for its manifestation. On that day, humanity will be destroyed, but we who have heeded the truth will ascend, and be transformed.<br><br><br>In this sacred void—temple we willingly entomb ourselves, to preserve our souls until the Far God comes. I have instructed my fellow adherents to record their last words as they prepare for the crypts, in the hope that other be inspired to join us.<br><br><br>I wasted many years on false religions and hollow human faiths. Now I worship something real - something powerful. The Far God calls to me in my dreams. It is coming.<br> |
| 2/9 | ORDER OF THE FAR GOD, LOG 2/9
<br>Personal Log<br>Vanya Hargrave<br>Third Herald of the First Chapter<br><br><br>I'm ready. I've been ready for a long time, actually, but the fasting and the trials have left me feeling lighter...purer.<br><br><br>I was glad to come here. Most of my chapter is gone. They burned our hive-chapel to the ground. Everyone I knew died.<br><br><br>I'm not afraid of death because I know it isn't the end. When the Far God comes, we will experience a glorious rebirth that will elevate us to a higher plane. But for so many of my friends to have suffered at the hands of the ignorant and fearful...it sickens me. So much pain.<br><br><br>I've had enough of pain. I'm ready for my reward. I'm ready for the peace the Far God will bring.<br> |
| 3/9 | ORDER OF THE FAR GOD, LOG 3/9
<br>Personal Log<br>Reuben Delgado<br>Adherent of the Seventh Chapter<br><br><br>I don't know where I am. I thought we were going to the hive-chapel but instead we came here. Is it time? Is the Far God coming?<br><br><br>They gave me something for the pain. Injections. Man, I've had a lifetime of injections. At first it was fun. Then it was necessary.<br><br><br>I don't know what's going to happen. But you know what? It doesn't matter. Even if there's nothing afterwards. Nothing means no more injections. It couldn't be worse than what I've been through. Anything's better than being me.<br> |
| 4/9 | ORDER OF THE FAR GOD, LOG 4/9
<br>Personal Log<br>Dr Hester Dolmayne<br>First Witness of the Sixth Chapter<br><br><br>Things have progressed. Now we're at the stage when we can enter suspended animation. It's a shame in a way, as I wanted to be conscious to witness the Far God's arrival. But our Herald assured me that the automatic systems will wake us up as soon as It manifests.<br><br><br>I'm curious to know what will happen. Will we keep our human bodies, or will we be given new forms so we can function in the Far God's dimension? I've sometimes wondered if the flower-ships might once have been human - maybe people from escape pods taken by the Thargoids. If so, it's a remarkable transformation. No need for crude starships any more - we'll be able to soar through space ourselves.<br><br><br>No matter What happens, it's thrilling to know that we'll be the ones to experience the next stage of evolution. We are the future of the human race.<br> |

## Timeline

19 JUL 3307

- The enigmatic Thargoid-worshipping religious order is examined by Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency. "Of all the myriad faiths practised across the galaxy, the Far God cult is one of the strangest and least understood. But in recent years it has grown from a fringe sect to a widespread religion. Its central tenet is that an unknowable being exists beyond our dimension – the Far God. What we call the Thargoids are its heralds, preparing for when it descends from hyperspace to instantly wipe out all life. This apocalyptic creed therefore attracts people who have nothing to live for, and who find purpose in awaiting armageddon. The cult has no official name or spokespeople, and its followers willingly replace their names with titles such as adherent, disciple and witness. This dehumanising approach includes its members wearing simple black robes and making their hive-chapels resemble Thargoid bio-technology, complete with ammonia fumes. Despite praying to an alien species, this is not the Thargoid fifth column many feared it to be. In fact they are pacifistic fatalists, expecting death and never offering resistance. This has caused them to be victimised by other doomsayer cults, anti-xeno activists and even the Federal Intelligence Agency… yet their serene patience has allowed them to survive. The discovery of two abandoned void-temples in the Etain system provided an insight into the cultists' mindset. Here can be heard the final testaments of people willingly entombed in suspended animation to await the Far God's arrival. More recently there are reports of several chapters of the sect migrating to the Panjabell system. This is controlled by the Pleiades Concordat, a theocracy devoted to the Far God, so perhaps it is preparing something bigger – or stranger – than we've seen before."^[1]^

30 MAR 3305

- The occupant of a cryogenic pod recovered from an abandoned outpost used by the Far God sect has been revived successfully. 17 year old Kiona O'Connor has been confirmed as the occupant. Following medical checks and an extended debriefing by the Federal Intelligence Agency, she made this statement to Vox Galactica: "I'd been homeless for a long time when the monks took me in. I never understood much about the Far God, really...I just needed to get off the streets. A lot of people there were like me. Somehow I ended up at the outpost, where they put us all into suspended animation. I've no idea what happened after that. I'm just grateful to be alive. I hope the others are too...I hope they got whatever they were praying for." The FIA has contacted Kiona's father, John O'Connor, and arranged for her to be escorted to her family home.^[2]^

23 MAR 3305

- The Federal Intelligence Agency has discovered an intact cryogenic pod underneath an outpost once used by Far God worshippers. Freelance reporter Alexei Keel broke the news on Vox Galactica: "The FIA survey team had been scanning the abandoned base on Etain 4 c with customised military sensors. It's thought this operation is part of a search for a missing undercover agent who infiltrated the Far God cult. A faint power source was detected in a collapsed underground chamber, which led agents to a solitary cryogenic pod hidden beneath tons of debris. Once excavated, it was conveyed to a medical facility where efforts to safely revive its occupant are now underway. There was no way of identifying who is inside the pod. But it seems likely that they are one of the adherents who recorded audio logs at the site, prior to entering suspended animation to await the Far God."^[3]^

08 DEC 3304

- Journalist Gethin Okonkwo has discussed the abandoned Far God cult outposts in the Etain system: "During my months undercover as a Far God worshipper, I heard only whispered rumours about secret outposts. So the existence of two such settlements, on Etain 4a and 4c, proves that much remained hidden from me. The personal logs recovered from the outposts illustrate how the faith attracted people from varied backgrounds. I was astonished to hear the voice of a man with whom I once eagerly discussed the Far God's arrival, never realising that he was a Federal agent whose devotion was as fake as my own. The book I am co-writing with Dr Alfred Ulyanov will reveal much about the Far God religion, but it's clear that many of its mysteries are yet to be uncovered."^[4]^

28 NOV 3304

- Exotheologian Dr Alfred Ulyanov has commented on the abandoned Far God outposts recently discovered in the Etain system: "This fascinating discovery implies that the missing chapters of the Far God sect were not arrested or killed, but instead fled to secret outposts to avoid persecution. According to personal logs recovered from the sites, the sect's members planned to wait in suspended animation for the coming of the Far God. The logs also reveal surprising details about what motivated these individuals to devote themselves to the faith. Evidence suggests that the settlements on Etain 4a and 4c both came under attack, but whether by Thargoids or human forces is unclear. Mysteriously, no trace remains of the inhabitants. I am indebted to the explorers who discovered these sites. This information will significantly contribute to the book I am co-writing with Gethin Okonkwo about the Far God religion."^[5]^
