Farmer

**Gryph Jones** is a farmer living on 78 Ursae Majoris B 3.

He was not fond of the Federation's rule of the 78 Ursae Majoris, and seemed more content once the Alioth Independents were elected and the system joined the Alliance.

Interviews with him have been published twice so far by GalNet news.

He knew of the War for Lugh and the Onionhead controversy, and the mess they were causing Jasmina Halsey's administration, but was fuzzy on the specifics.

17 MAR 3301

- Rebels declared war on the Federation in 78 Ursae Majoris, and Gryph Jones woke up to find he lived near one of the heaviest focal points of the conflict.

> Pah! The Federation! Now, I won't say I support this war, the revolutionaries are monsters and criminals, but the inability of the local Federal government to keep things under control is exactly why those folks are so unpopular here! The Feds are too busy playing with Lughnatics and Onionheads half a galaxy to focus on places like this - maybe both sides will kill each other off, I can't help but think we'd be better off for it.
