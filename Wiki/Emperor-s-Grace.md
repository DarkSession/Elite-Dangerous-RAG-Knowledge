**Emperor's Grace** is a player minor faction headquartered in the Novas system. Its leader is Admiral Varrwen Mako Brennus.

It was also an alliance of player groups focused on supporting the NPC faction by the same name. They were formed to prepare for the inevitable war between the Empire and the Federation and coordinate war efforts. The coup de grace for Emperor's Grace came in mid-February 3302 when they lost their only player-controlled system, Novas. This effectively left them homeless.

This player group has retired with some members still playing casually.
