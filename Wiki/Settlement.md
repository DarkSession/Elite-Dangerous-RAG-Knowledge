Settlement on atmospheric planet
 		 	 

**Settlements** are on planet surfaces. Their basic division is Surface Settlements and Odyssey Settlements. Unlike Surface Ports, ships and SRVs can only dock at the Odyssey subset of Settlements which lacks hangars under Landing Pads. Surface Settlements do not display in the Contacts panel of the HUD.

Settlements can be guarded by Skimmers, anti-SRV turrets, and anti-ship defence turrets. Depending on their security level, they can have no-fly-zones and areas which are off-limits to SRVs. Trespassing in these for too long, accessing private data towers, attacking the defenders, or destroying generators can trigger the settlement defenses and trigger a fine or bounty if the controlling faction is not lawless.

The term "Settlements" in the Navigation filters denotes all inhabited places on a surface, including Planetary Ports, Planetary Outposts, Workshops, and Surface Settlements, Odyssey Settlements.

## Settlements (Odyssey)

 	 	[![ED Odyssey Settlement and rings](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/3/3d/ED_Odyssey_Settlement_and_rings.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220810113708)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/3/3d/ED_Odyssey_Settlement_and_rings.png/revision/latest?cb=20220810113708) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
A Settlement in Odyssey
 		 	 

*ED: Odyssey* added over 400,000 settlements.^[1]^ These are new types on landable planets and moons with tenuous atmospheres. These settlements feature a variety of building types, such as power plants, factories, habitats as well as defence systems to protect against hostile ships. Commanders can enter these settlements at any time or as part of missions, interact, kill, or avoid the inhabitants, and steal items. Settlements are controlled by minor factions. Larger settlements and more powerful factions can field stronger security. A commander's actions at a settlement can affect a minor faction's standing within the Background Simulation.^[2]^ Settlements can also host Conflict Zones.

Settlements are found in one of nine system states, which affect the activities available there and the presence of colonists and security forces: Active, Abandoned, War, Damaged, Online, Online Damaged, Offline, Offline Damaged, and Conflict Zone. If a commander attacks a populated settlement and does not prevent the personnel there from raising the alarm, the controlling minor faction will dispatch reinforcements, but these are finite; however, a commander who massacres an entire settlement and defeats all reinforcements will face severe consequences. Depopulated settlements will repopulate over time. Anti-ship defences also make aerial attacks on settlements risky unless commanders on the ground disable those defences first. Commanders can also deactivate a settlement's power plant, which also disables its security systems.^[3]^

### Structures and rooms

Inside a hydroponics facility
 		 	 

Settlements contain a variety of structures with specialised interiors, including structures like command centres, general living quarters, and production facilities. Each structure contains certain interactive features, as well as Components, Goods, and Data to collect. For example, a commander can sneak into a command centre and grant themselves a legitimate level 3 security authorisation for the entire settlement at one of the terminals, or raid a production facility to steal a requested item for a mission.

Structures are enclosed spaces, and when their environmental systems are active they offer protection from the heat or cold of a planet's environment when entered; suits also cease expending their oxygen supplies while a commander is indoors. If a settlement structure is damaged and on fire, the fire can be extinguished by finding and deactivating the structure's life support, which will vent the interior's air.

### Structure types

Structure types include:

| Structure type | Abbreviation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Agriculture | AGR | A facility present in agricultural settlements. They typically consist of linked dome-like structures containing isolated hydroponic units. |
| Biological | BIO | A semi-inflated tent structure, often present in clusters in agricultural settlements. These cannot be opened or entered. |
| Command Centre | CMD | A settlement's administrative hub. Found in most settlement types, but may not be present in smaller settlements. If a settlement has one, its turret and alarm/authority controls are likely to be located there. |
| Extraction | EXT | An ore extraction or processing facility, usually located close to laser drilling platforms. |
| Habitat | HAB | A common area where settlement personnel rest when off-duty. Some small settlements may not have dedicated HAB units. |
| Industrial | IND | An industrial manufacturing facility. |
| Power Centre | PWR | A settlement's power generation and management building. Present in all settlements; may be connected to other buildings via access tunnels. Some higher-security settlements feature a CMD-PWR hybrid building, where the reactor is only accessible by passing through the Command Centre. |
| Research | RES | A research facility. A good source of high-end materials. |
| Storage | STO | A warehouse where containers and equipment are stored. |

### Room types

Settlements may have these room types:

| Room type | Abbreviation | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cabin | CBN | A room inside Habitat structures. Private quarters for one or two people at most; usually nicer than a Dormitory, usually only seen at Tourist settlements. |
| Corridor | CORR | Connecting passages within most structure types. |
| Dormitory | DORM | A room inside Habitat structures. Shared sleeping area for multiple personnel. In smaller HAB buildings, may also include food preparation and eating areas. |
| Foyer | FOY | A small connecting room, usually linking a corridor to one or more other rooms in a larger complex. |
| Hydroponics | HYD | A room inside Agriculture structures. Contains many isolated hydroponic units for growing plants in tightly controlled conditions. |
| Laboratory | LAB | A room inside Research facilities. Contains scientific equipment and machinery such as centrifuges. |
| Loading Bay | LOAD | A loading and unloading area sometimes found in larger Industrial and Storage buildings. |
| Medical | MED | A room that provides medical services, usually dominated by some kind medical scanning bed or similar apparatus. Sometimes found in Research buildings. |
| Operations | OPR | A room inside Command Centres. Typically requires Level 3 Access and considered a Restricted Area. |
| Power | POW | The restricted room within a Power Centre that contains the settlement's main reactor. |
| Processing | PROC | A room found inside Agriculture, Industrial, and Extraction structures. |
| Security | SEC | A security control room found inside Command Centres. May be located near one or more secure holding cells, and is often a restricted area. |
| Washroom | WASH | A communal room inside larger Habitat structures. Includes showers, personal cleaning facilities, and lockers. |

### Security

In addition to civilian personnel, settlements are protected by guards who actively patrol the grounds and structures, searching for intruders or illicit activities. Settlement guards may ask visitors to submit to a security scan via Profile Analyser. Failing to submit will trigger a security alert, incur a fine, and all guards will shoot the intruder on sight. They will also attack if they detect stolen goods or an E-Breach in the visitor's backpack. Fines will not be incurred if the settlement is controlled by an Anarchy faction, making such settlements very useful for farming Assets, Goods, and Data.

Settlements use a security authorisation system to deny access to visitors and infiltrators. Authorisation levels range from 0 to 3, with 0 being the lowest level and granted to a visitor whom the settlement's controlling minor faction is neutral towards, and 3 being the highest level and restricted to the most important personnel. Commanders who are detected inside a structure that they lack the necessary authorisation to access will be tagged as criminals and targeted by guards. However, the same authorisation system applies to settlement personnel: guards will not enter structures if they lack the appropriate authorisation level, even if they witness intruders enter those structures. The authorisation system can be disabled for doors by interacting with a special control panel somewhere in the settlement, but most other authorisation requirements (such as the Reactor Management Terminal in PWR buildings) will remain in place.

Settlements that have been powered down will not have any guards or civilian personnel, but hostile scavengers may be present instead.

If a settlement is large enough, it may also be protected by anti-ship, anti-personnel, and point-defense turrets. Anti-ship and anti-personnel turrets will actively engage ship and ground threats respectively, whilst point-defense turrets will attempt to shoot down missiles, similar to ship-mounted Point Defence Turrets. All three types of turret can be shut down by interacting with special control panels located somewhere in the settlement, which requires Access Level 2. Settlements may also be guarded by one or more Skimmers; most often S4 Sentry units, though larger or higher-security settlements may be guarded by an S9 Goliath instead. Settlements with a Military economy will also have at least one System Authority Vessel guarding.

Settlement security alarms can be exploited by infiltrators to distract guards and other personnel while carrying out illegal mission objectives. First, locate an alarm in a building away from the objective, then activate it while no personnel are watching and leave the building without being spotted. This may require obtaining security authorisation to enter a restricted building with an alarm; if a cloned authorisation profile is used, be sure to clear it after leaving the restricted building to prevent it from being picked up by any guards making security scans. Next, proceed to the building where the mission objective is located. Any guards normally patrolling the target building will leave to investigate the source of the alarm, and only civilian personnel will remain, which should make it much easier to reach the objective without detection or needing to kill anyone.^[4]^

### Landing

Settlements have Landing Pads and can accommodate ships, including Apex Interstellar Transport shuttles. The number of Landing Pads available depends on the settlement's type. Tourism settlements are one of the largest settlement types, and have 2 small pads, 1 medium pad, and 1 large pad, while a smaller type like a military settlement or small mining operation may have only 2 small pads.

Be sure to confirm which minor faction is in control of the settlement and stow weapons before approaching it. Landing near a settlement controlled by a hostile minor faction or approaching a settlement with weapons deployed will trigger a response from the settlement's guards and anti-ship defences. This also applies to visitors arriving or departing aboard Apex shuttles.

### Missions

Commanders can be sent to settlements for a variety of reasons, and can also pick up missions from consoles and NPCs at these settlements. Possible tasks include restoring power to the settlement, stealing the settlement's power regulator, sabotaging agricultural or industrial processes by stealing samples or inserting contaminants, collecting or delivering items (potentially including contraband, which also means evading the settlement's guards), stealing valuable or important items, stealing data or installing malware on dataports, assassinating a specific individual, and so on. These settlement missions are only available from the Concourse of stations or surface bases, or from consoles and NPCs at other settlements.

It is important to note that many key objects within a settlement (such as the reactor controls, sample containment units, *etc.*) are also linked to the facility's alarms, and tampering with these devices without disabling the alarms first will alert all of the settlement guards and cause for reinforcements to be dispatched. This means extra care should be taken if the mission's objectives require that the alarm not be raised.

## Surface Settlements (Horizons)

ED: Horizons added surface settlements which were designed for SRVs. There are no interiors for on foot, because they predate Odyssey.

### Generic Settlements

 	 	[![Settlementsizeandsecurityratingexample](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/c/c2/Settlementsizeandsecurityratingexample.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20160105013343)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/c/c2/Settlementsizeandsecurityratingexample.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160105013343) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Settlement size and security rating
 		 	 

The vast majority of Surface Settlements, numbering in the thousands, are generic locations with visible navigation markers on the Planetary Map in the System Map. They can serve specialized economic purposes: Agriculture, Colony, Extraction, High Tech, Industrial, Military, Refinery, Tourism. The size of Settlements is indicated by a varying number of + signs up to three: the more + signs, the bigger the Settlement. A Settlement without any + signs is usually only one or two buildings. Generic Settlements are often selected as target locations for certain types of combat and sabotage missions.

### Unique Settlements

Some Surface Settlements are unique, and distinguished from generic Surface Settlements by several characteristics: they do not initially have markers in the System Map (activating any local data beacons may cause a marker to appear from then on), they rarely have any active automated defenses, they are not used as targets for any missions unless there is a Tourist Beacon integrated into the site, and most have unique data logs. A subset of unique Settlements can be found by following listening posts.

#### Abandoned Settlements

Dav's Hope, an abandoned mining settlement
 		 	 

There are abandoned Settlements which do not have interactive objects apart from recoverable data logs and data beacons. One of the most well-known is the mining settlement Dav's Hope in Hyades Sector DR-V c2-23, where plentiful Manufactured Materials can be salvaged.^[5]^ Known abandoned Settlements are listed below.^[6]^

INRA base Taylor Keep
 		 	 

The now-defunct Intergalactic Naval Reserve Arm operated from a number of covert bases during the first conflict against the Thargoids in the 32nd century. A number of these bases were rediscovered in late 3303 as new Thargoid incursions occurred in the Pleiades Nebula and Core Systems, and audio logs recovered from the bases shed light on INRA's unethical actions and betrayal of the famed CMDR John Jameson.

Thargoid Attacked Settlement Scrump Landing
 		 	 

Since June 28, 3304, independent pilots have found a number of abandoned settlements that had been attacked by Thargoid forces. While some of the settlements managed to evacuate before they were attacked, others were not so lucky. Recovered logs indicate that some survivors may have been abducted by the Thargoids.

### Interactive Objects

There are various interactive objects which can be found at both unique and generic Settlements:

| Object | Description | Image |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data points | Can be scanned with a Data Link Scanner for intel packages, which can be handed over to a Major Faction for credits. |  |
| Data towers | Control and monitor various functions of the settlement and can be accessed with a Data Link Scanner. |  |
| Generators | Power various functions of the settlement and can be destroyed. |  |

### Settlement Missions

 	 	[![ED Odyssey Settlement](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/0/0b/ED_Odyssey_Settlement.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220810113347)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/0/0b/ED_Odyssey_Settlement.png/revision/latest?cb=20220810113347) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Odyssey settlement
 		 	 

For example pirate factions give *Destroy the Generator* missions where the commander must destroy a defense system power supply.

## Power generator mission

For Power Generator missions it says you need an SRV, but you don't necessarily need to use it. Scout the area with your ship until you find the lone generator or the multiple generators.

Once you find it, target the generator from the side that has an opening that enables you to hit the inside. Now you can just shoot the generator and destroy it. This only works from the angle at which you can hit the inside of it.

Alternatively, you can use dumbfire missiles. If you take this course of action, you need to get close enough so the anti-air guns don't shoot it out and fire the missiles. You will get the mission complete status.

It's honestly that simple. Scouting in your ship allows you to get in and out before the trespass alarm sounds off. Missiles are easy, quick ways to take out the generator in one go. They also don't use any WEP pips. Just approach with 4 in SYS and 2 in ENG. You will need the shield defense, but you won't need to stay in there for long if you get the first shot off onto the generator. The alarm doesn't go off when the missile fires, it goes off when the missile destroys the generator.

### Defence Turrets

Some Settlements are guarded by several Defence Turrets of varying sizes; both small anti-vehicle turrets and large anti-starship batteries.

Small anti-ground turrets are kinetic-based, whilst the standard anti-ship batteries are pulse or burst lasers. The largest anti-ship batteries are heavy kinetic cannons.

A Defense Platform is a large turret for air defense. Sensor range before trespassing warning at low security is 728m. Sensor range before trespassing warning at medium security is 1.6km for ships However this distance depends on where the defense platforms are placed.

### Proximity Sensors

 	 	[![Proximity sensor-0](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/d/d0/Proximity_sensor-0.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160105155532)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/d/d0/Proximity_sensor-0.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160105155532) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Proximity Sensor
 		 	 

Settlements with medium or higher security ratings have proximity sensors. Proximity sensor placement is based on both the population rating and the Security rating. Some Settlements have no proximity sensors.

|  |  | + | ++ | +++ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low Security | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Medium Security | 700m | ? | none or ? | ? |
| High Security | 990m | ? | ? | 1.7km-1.75km |

### Objects

| Object | Description | Image |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Defense System Power Supply | These generators power many different buildings such as weapon batteries or comms dishes. They can be disabled by firing at them. They don’t appear on your sensors until you're relatively close. So they can sometimes be tricky to locate. There are normally several and you need to take out the right one. |  |
| Force Field Security Barrier | Force Fields block both ground vehicles and bullets. They often block ramps and can be disabled by destroying a nearby generator. Some high security settlements will have gates that close on you if you enter a restricted area. |  |
| Turret Security Terminal | Some missions will ask you to destroy a generator attached to a turret under the transaction tab but, you actually have to scan a Turret Security Terminal (Horizons 2.01) |  |
