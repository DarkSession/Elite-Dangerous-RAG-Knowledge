Search and Rescue

A **Search and Rescue Patrol** is a roving signal source that consists of a ship patrolling a star system for other ships in need of fuel. These ships broadcast various messages on public comms channels that can be picked up while traveling in supercruise.

## Contents

Search and Rescue Patrol encounters consist of a single non-hostile ship, such as an Asp Explorer. They can be interdicted, but will drop into normal space on their own if followed. Search and Rescue Patrol ships are equipped with Fuel Transfer Limpet Controllers which they will automatically use to give fuel to any ship that followed them into normal space.

## Spawn Locations

Search and Rescue Patrols can appear in shipping lanes in any populated system.

## Comms Messages

- "Scanning for at-risk pilots, will report back with my findings."
- "Control. I've located a ship running on fumes. Moving in to offer assistance."
- "Commander. I'm going to drop down into normal space, if you need help, please try to follow me."
