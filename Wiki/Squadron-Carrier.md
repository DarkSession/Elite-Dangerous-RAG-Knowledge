## Overview

It operates similar to a Drake-Class Carrier, and it's bigger. There are 32 landing pads: 16 large, 8 medium and 8 small. You're the one managing it and deciding where to jump. Anyone with permission can decide where to hyperjump. It has more storage space for a physical bank: commodities, personal items, goods and assets that you collect. Ships can be stored. Such as a trading squadron can put together some ships in the bank and others can lease them. There are currently no engineered modules, but you can outfit it anyway you want. Such as store fully A-rated vessels. You can put them in the bank and someone else can use it.
