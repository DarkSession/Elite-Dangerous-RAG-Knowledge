### Random encounters

Threat level 2 random Crash Sites contain a single destroyed Scarab, one container with Goods that will be marked stolen once retrieved, the Scarab's murdered driver, and a lone criminal guarding the site. Maintenance panels on the Scarab can be cut open with the Arc Cutter to scavenge Components, and the guard can be scanned with the Profile Analyser to obtain a Bounty Voucher.

Threat level 3 Crash Sites contain the same as the above, but after killing the criminal guard, a ship will arrive and deploy at least two additional hostiles.

### Mission objectives

Threat level 2 mission Crash Sites contain a crashed Eagle MkII, at least three containers, and a group of seven criminals guarding the site. Missions that generate these sites involve retrieving a specific item from one of the containers.
