## Nebulae

    - *Main article: Nebulae*

### **Lagoon Nebula**

This nebula is surrounded by neutron stars, black holes and a cluster of B/A-type stars. It is luminous from far away, and is the first nebula along the route to Sgr A\*. Inside the Lagoon Nebula is a Colonia outpost, Amundsen Terminal. The famed 'Thor's Eye' black hole also lies around here, a worthy stop along the way.

### Spirograph Nebula

This little planetary nebula has so much to offer. The brilliant greenish colour covers your view. The Spirograph is also close to inhabited space, and the massive O-Type central star is an everlasting presence.

### NGC 7822

NGC 7822 is a peculiar nebula. From very far away, the nebula is visible as a faint glow which appears as a star, but as any explorer draws closer they will realise that it is not a star they're looking at, but a star cluster of massive O-type stars. In this already intriguing place, there are well over 10 black holes in the S171 systems, making it a superb place for the aspiring explorer to see them. Finally, you have the colours of the nebula which round it off.

### Barnard's Loop and surrounding nebulae

Barnard's Loop is a massive nebula close to Sol. Around it lie several others:

- Orion Nebula
- Flame Nebula
- Horsehead Nebula
- Running Man Nebula
- Spirograph Nebula
- Messier 78
- Eskimo Nebula
- Witch Head Nebula
- Cone Nebula
- Hind Nebula

You have all those nebulae in a relatively tight cluster for you to explore no more than 1.5kly from Sol. There is also the 2MASS cluster, which has many systems to explore with ELWs and AAs.

### Fine Ring Nebula

The fine ring nebula is a beautiful area of space and is shaped like a huge blue and purple halo, a must visit for anyone in the surrounding area.

### Crab Pulsar and surrounding nebulae

The Crab Nebula, centred around the Crab Pulsar, is quite possibly the most kaleidoscopic nebula to date, with almost every imaginable colour at least somewhere, it really is an incredible vista to see. It is also surrounded by some other beauteous nebulae namely:

- Jellyfish Nebula
- Rosette Nebula
- Seagull Nebula
- Monkey Head Nebula
- Veil Nebula West

Part of the supernova remnant known as the Cygnus Loop, the ‘West’ Veil Nebula is a long blue and pink collection of gas. Due to the unique appearance, it has also been called, “Witch’s Broom,” “Finger of God,” and, “Filamentary Nebula.” Within this nebula there is also a planet that has huge yellow geysers which create an interesting lense over the nebula around you.

### Sadr Region and surrounding nebulae

Similar to Barnard's Loop, except this is a harder difficulty. It's further from inhabited space and the nebulae are more spaced out, however, you have a greater variety of nebulae, these nebulae include The North American and Pelican Nebula, Veil Nebula East/West and NGC 7822.

### Bubble Nebula

What a strange nebula. It is exactly what the name implies, a bubble. A pink bubble which makes for a bright and stunning colour which hangs around as you explore this small nebula. Also, this nebula is near to the Formidine Rift and is neighbours with the famed Heart and Soul Nebula.

### Pleiades Nebula

Perhaps the closest nebula to Sol the Pleiades is home to the famous star cluster of the same name. It is a nebula associated with aliens and its eerie blue colour. In Maia, you have what is likely to be every explorer's first sight of a black hole. This nebula also has a station, Obsidian Orbital and multiple planetary settlements.

## Stellar Objects & Oddities

There are some truly dodgy stellar objects. Here are some favourites.

### Fleasi MS-U e2-301

This neutron star is orbited by a class-V gas giant at an astonishingly close 8 light-seconds. The intense radiation of the neutron star has increased the surface temperature of the gas giant so high that it emits a blinding white glow and no surface features can be determined. Commanders who approach the object closely will find their visual systems overloaded and controls reduced to nothing but a pure white blur. What allows the gas giant to remain intact is not understood, as the extremely hot gas should have been dispersed off into space or pulled into the neutron star long ago. This is truly an unexplained mystery of our galaxy.

### Synuefe VM-D c15-10 2a

Synuefe VM-D c15-10 2a is a planet with one of the most incredible landscapes known to date, with geometrical features ranging from 20km deep canyons to 20km high peaks - other planets similar to this are Pomeche 2C and Traikaae CH-Y c10.

### Skardee 1

This little planet orbits the main star at a distance of 1Ls. It is impossible to land without taking damage if you have no heat sinks, so bring a couple. It may be terrifying to get to the surface, but once you do you won't regret it as the star fills your view.

### Myrielk QX-X c28-1093

At only ~180ly from Sagittarius A\*, the exotic giant id a great trip for explorers travelling to the galactic core. Not only is the planet extremely close to the main star and is visible from the hyperspace-dropout; the planet is also absolutely massive and has little to no surface terrain features on the celestial body.

### Mitterand Hollow

Similar, except with a moon and a planet. Mitterand Hollow is a moon in the Epsilon Indi system which orbits New Africa. It orbits so close and so quickly that it takes 32 seconds for a full day to happen and there is a solar eclipse every minute, plunging the planet into total darkness. A large mountain range on the moon is always in darkness.

### Sagittarius A\*

Sagittarius A\* is a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. It is very interesting as around half a million solar masses have been packed into 15.5 solar radii. That is fearsome. Sgr A\* is also the perfect centre of our galaxy, when at the system you are in the very core of the Milky Way. Reaching Sgr A\* is a huge milestone for any explorer, but it isn't alone. In the system, a B-type star called Source 2 orbits the supermassive black hole.

### Sol

The home of humanity and a lovely system to visit. The colours of Venus are absolutely unique and you can see the terraformed Mars, as well as Earth. There is a multitude of dwarf planets in the system, including Pluto, but a ninth planet as well, Persephone. Another amazing oddity of this system is the geological features on Uranus’ moon; Ariel.

### Rho Cassiopiae

Currently the only white supergiant known and tricky to reach if you like a challenge, you can head south from Rho Cassiopiae across the rift to find probably the spookiest place in Elite - The Formidine Rift

### VY Canis Majoris

The largest star in the game. This star fills your screen at 5,500Ls away. Massive.

### Great Annihilator

This is the 'baby Sagittarius A\*'. The largest black hole in the game which isn't Sgr A\*, and only 3,000LY away. There is another black hole in the system, the Great Annihilator B, but it has far less solar radii.

### Colonia Outposts

All these Colonia-controlled outposts lie along the route to Colonia from inhabited space. They are all chosen and have breathtaking views inside nebulae, not to mention that you can refuel, restock and resupply at the outposts. If you need, you can also sell exploration data so that you can secure the profit just in case you run into trouble along the way to Colonia.

## Systems

### 2MASS J02351897+6131236

 	 	[![Star System 2MASS J02351897+6131236](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/0/0d/Star_System_2MASS_J02351897%2B6131236.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20240626143632)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/0/0d/Star_System_2MASS_J02351897%2B6131236.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20240626143632) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
2MASS J02351897+6131236
 		 	 

Part of the IC 1805 cluster, this system is swarming with stellar objects. The high-mass O-type is in a nested binary pair with no less than three different black holes ranging from 9.4 to 31.3 solar masses. What really makes this system stand out are the five K-class stars and nine M-class stars, including one with a rare ring system. From the surface of one of the landable planets these stars will appear to flitter and fly across the sky during their orbits, giving the appearance of a field of fireflies.^[2]^

### Wepooe AA-A h509

A rare octenary system with the primary stellar objects being a neutron star and seven Black Holes. This is the highest known quantity of Black Holes in a single system found a the time of writing. The majority of the remaining 31 stellar bodies, including six Brown Dwarves with landable moons, are in orbit around four of the Black Holes. The Neutron Star has a significant light bending effect that is clearly visable on approach, similar to the lensing effect of a black hole.

### Skaude AA-A h294

This incredible system (aka 'Collection of Wonders') contains two black holes, a ringed M-class star, a ringed white dwarf, and a ringed neutron star. The M-class star is one of the largest known stellar bodies containing a ring system. A tourist beacon is set up near the M-class star.

### Dryau Ausms KG-Y e3390

Absolute madness of a system from a topology standpoint. The black hole drop star is in an extremely tight binary with a white dwarf (&lt;3ls), which itself has a gas giant orbiting fully inside it's exclusion zone and passing through the cones with a period of 14 minutes. Less than 13ls away lies a contact-binary of a huge water world and a ringed gas giant, the latter of which has 2 volcanic moons skimming the very edge of the rings on slightly inclined orbits. Conjointly, a high-metal content world is located just 7ls from the drop-out point, torched by the white dwarf, providing incredible sunrise and set vistas. The views offered from the surface of the landable moons is unlike anything seen elsewhere in the galaxy, and all objects in the inner system have extremely short orbital periods creating a dynamically changing view in the sky. Absolute must visit for anyone in the area. Also of note in this sytem is a ringed brown-dwarf and many other beautiful-landable worlds.

### Wepae AA-A h22

This system has an earth-like orbiting the barycenter of two black holes and also contains a ringed M-Type star with a huge ring system. Conjointly there is a neutron star and many of the planets are contained within the star's ring system.

### Dryoea Flyuae AA-A g392

This system contains a pink gas giant along with a collection of four neutron stars and one black hole. AN incredible system to visit, very similar to Eoch Flyi AA-A h283 which also has four neutrons but has three black holes.

### Gria Drye UZ-X d1-29

 	 	[![Flyiedge FV-W d2-1 AB](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/e/e2/Flyiedge_FV-W_d2-1_AB.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20241211052428)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/e/e2/Flyiedge_FV-W_d2-1_AB.png/revision/latest?cb=20241211052428) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Flyiedge FV-W d2-1 AB
 		 	 

This system contains four stars, one of them being a neutron star that can only be described as a millisecond pulsar. The rest are class M. And A and B orbit each other ***very*** closely. A orbits at a SMA of 0.00AU and B orbits at a SMA of 0.01AU. The whole system is a binary with a star orbiting it, making it a ternary, and another star orbits the ternary, making it a quanary. This system was added here by CMDR Clon3drom3. Another system similar to this is Flyiedge FV-W d2-1.
