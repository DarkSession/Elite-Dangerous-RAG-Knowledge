An Outpost
 		 	 

**Outposts**, sometimes called Orbital Outposts to distinguish them from ground-based facilities like Surface Ports and Settlements, are relatively small and modular space stations. They differ significantly from the vastly larger Starports and Asteroid Bases, which are usually the major hubs within a system. Outposts have between three and five Landing Pads, no docking support for large ships, and minimal security emplacements and patrols. They also lack any rotating habitation structures to simulate gravity for occupants, and docked ships are held in place magnetically.

## Outpost Types

There are seven Outpost variants, each built to serve a specific economic role: Civilian, Commercial, Industrial, Military, Mining, Scientific, and Unsanctioned.

| Name | Example | CollapseImage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commercial Outpost |  |  |
| Civilian Outpost |  |  |
| Scientific Outpost | Canonn Institute, Col 285 Sector IX-T d3-43 |  |
| Mining Outpost | Robigo Mines, Robigo |  |
| Industrial Outpost | al-Din Prospect, Alpha Centauri |  |
| Military Outpost |  |  |
| Unsanctioned Outpost |  |  |

## Colonisation

Outposts are Tier 1 in Colonisation. If selected as the main (first) station, it can be constructed with the following resources delivered to the colony ship within 4 weeks. Each outpost type (as listed above) requires a slightly different amount of materials in order to be constructed.

| Material | Commercial | Civilian | Criminal | Scientific | Industrial | Military |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Water | 706 | 621 | 769 | 771 | 729 |
| Copper | 234 | 218 | 240 | 251 | 242 |
| Food Cartridges | 94 | 94 | 92 | 91 | 91 |
| Semiconductors | 65 | 56 | 70 | 68 | 70 |
| Power Generators | 20 | 19 | 18 | 19 | 18 |
| Computer Components | 50 | 50 | 65 | 60 | 65 |
| Ceramic Composites | 504 | 497 | 500 | 502 | 530 |
| Insulating Membrane | 357 | 311 | 345 | 349 | 545 |
| Medical Diagnostic Equipment | 13 | 13 | 13 | 13 | 13 |
| Titanium | 5579 | 4843 | 5603 | 5317 | 4843 |
| Fruit and Vegetables | 50 | 50 | 51 | 49 | 52 |
| Polymers | 545 | 497 | 498 | 543 | 497 |
| Superconductors | 107 | 100 | 109 | 114 | 108 |
| Water Purifiers | 39 | 38 | 37 | 38 | 36 |
| Non-Lethal Weapons | 13 | 13 | 12 | 13 | 13 |
| Liquid Oxygen | 1721 | 1553 | 1759 | 1769 | 1553 |
| CMM Composite | 4539 | 3912 | 4584 | 4680 | 5393 |
| Steel | 6936 | 5588 | 6473 | 6619 | 6701 |
| Aluminium | 513 | 0 | 477 | 517 | ?? |

While trying to optimize everything and fly as fast as possible it took approximately 8 to 10h of play to complete the outpost, in the best conditions (FC in front of mining facility and near colonization ship).

## Notes

- Based on the population data of systems that contain one Outpost and no other habitable structures, Outposts have an estimated population capacity ranging from as low as 10 to as high as 150,000, depending on their size and configuration.
- Unsanctioned Outposts are usually run by Anarchy minor factions and almost always have an active black market. Coupled with Outposts' bare-bones security, they make ideal hubs for Smugglers looking to sell illegal goods or take on missions that involve retrieving illegal salvage. It is also one of the few places that sells E-Breaches.
