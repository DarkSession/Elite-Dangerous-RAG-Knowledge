Makemake, dwarf planet and Trans-Neptunian object
 		 	 

**Makemake** is a dwarf planet and Trans-Neptunian object (orbits the sun further than Neptune) in the Sol system. It was discovered by astronomers Michael E. Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz on march 31, 2005. It is named after the creator god of the ancient Easter Island people, because it was discovered shortly after Easter and codenamed Easterbunny. It is made of ice and rock. The very low temperature makes ice as hard as rock.^[1]^
