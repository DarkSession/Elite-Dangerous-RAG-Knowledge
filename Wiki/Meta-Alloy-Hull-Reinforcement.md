The **Meta Alloy Hull Reinforcement** is a Hull Reinforcement Package that can be unlocked through a Technology Broker. It provides a measure of resistance against caustic damage inflicted by Thargoid weapons or the Enzyme Missile Rack. Unlike a standard Hull Reinforcement Package, no resistances to Kinetic, Thermal, or Explosive damage are included.

## Unlocking

The Meta Alloy Hull Reinforcement can be permanently unlocked for purchase by providing the following Materials to a Human Technology Broker:

- 16 Meta-Alloys
- 25 Focus Crystals
- 22 Aberrant Shield Pattern Analysis
- 20 Configurable Components
- 12 Reinforced Mounting Plate

## Usage

The Meta Alloy Hull Reinforcement's sole advantage over standard Hull Reinforcement Packages is that it is one of the few available sources of Caustic Resistance, which provides a ship with resistance to damage from most weapons used by Thargoid Interceptors, Scouts, and Thargon Swarms.

The only real advantage of these modules is in comparison to standard, non-Engineered Hull Reinforcement Packages. It does provide slightly superior performance in comparison, but minimally; they are typically outclassed by even G1 engineering. It is also inferior to the Guardian Hull Reinforcement Package, which also provides Caustic Resistance. Consequently, since it will generally be more difficult to unlock Meta Alloys than to unlock Hull Reinforcement Engineering, the Meta Alloy Hull Reinforcement cannot be recommended for either normal combat or anti-Thargoid combat.
