### New Maelstroms Increase Thargoid Conquests

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Two more rogue signal sources have reached human space, wreaking similar destruction to the Taranis Maelstrom.

The Indra anomaly arrived in the HIP 20567 system, with the Leigong anomaly slowing to a halt in HIP 8887. The Maelstroms, as these entities have been classified, both manifested as enormous gaseous clouds. These are known to be extremely hazardous to any ship venturing too close, but the nature of what lies within remains unknown.

As with Taranis, each new Maelstrom pre-empted staggering numbers of Thargoid vessels flooding nearby populated systems. Recent reports indicate that the alien fleets have completely dominated 9 systems in proximity to HIP 20567 and none close to HIP 8887. Starports, settlements and outposts have all been devastated or abandoned, with the total number of casualties unknown but feared considerable.

A total of 16 systems are currently facing active Thargoid invasions and are transmitting emergency calls for assistance. Rescue megaships have been designated as the gateway destination for refugees. The superpowers have also positioned anti-xeno capital ships to defend Allied, Federal and Imperial territories that have been invaded.

Public media channels have expressed grave concerns about the remaining rogue signal sources, which are en route to the core systems. It is expected that these will establish five more Maelstroms, each generating a new wave of Thargoid forces. With the combined death toll rapidly climbing, civil and military authorities alike are scrambling to implement a suitable response.

### Refugees Flee from Thargoid Offensive

Millions of people are being evacuated from systems that have suffered devastating attacks by Thargoid fleets.

An enormous humanitarian effort is underway, with rescue megaships positioned at key locations near each Thargoid-occupied system. Captain Justine Kemp of Rescue Ship Hutner, currently stationed in Enayex, described their operations to Vox Galactica:

“As per newly established procedures, all contracted transports carrying refugees from systems facing Thargoid invasion are directed to our landing bays. Emergency teams perform triage services and give direct aid where possible. But the focus is on quickly processing them for relocation to temporary housing, away from the warzones.”

“This is the most intense situation I’ve ever had to deal with. We’re taking in enormous numbers of people, not just from starports but from planetary settlements too. Virtually everything in some of these systems is ablaze, and the refugees just keep coming.”

Vox Galactica also published a selection of soundbites from various civilians escaping from Thargoid-occupied systems:

“It all happened so fast. Our family was eating together when the whole port seemed to shake. My son had befriended a trader who’d landed a few days ago, and he convinced her to take us on board her Hauler. The lurches as we weaved through Thargoid ships almost made me bring up the food we’d been enjoying minutes earlier.”

“I was at a starport observation window when their ships, those weird star-shaped things, zipped right past. Then the other side of the habitat ring just vanished. Fire and splinters of metal... All the sirens blared, and the crowds surged toward the bays. Heat filled the corridors and smoke clogged our lungs. I didn’t even see the ship I ended up on, only a sea of panicked faces smeared with grime.”“I’m looking for my dad. He was injured when I last saw him. Burns from that green corrosive stuff that punched through our quarters. The Commander didn’t have room on his ship for everyone. I convinced him to take my dad first. But now I can’t find him. The medics don’t have time to talk to me. I hope he’s here somewhere. He’s got to be here somewhere.”

### Plans for Enhanced AX Weaponry Accelerate

Two leading engineers have revealed designs to improve the stock anti-xeno weaponry available to pilots.

Liz Ryder and Zacariah Nemo have provided module modifications for many years, specialising in explosive and kinetic weapons respectively. Over the past year they have collaborated privately on the AX weapon designs introduce by Aegis in 3303, seeking to improve the efficiency of delivering a compound, hazardous to Thargoid vessels, which tips AX ammunition.

While something of a pet project between the two, the recent invasion of human space by Thargoid forces has made the need for these designs far more urgent. Ryder explained to The Imperial Herald:

“Zac and I share a passion for weapon upgrades, and have often used this project as a way to unwind after a long week’s work. He’s a weird guy but fascinating to work with. But when the Taranis signal arrived and the Thargoid forces started taking control of systems, we knew we had to reveal the designs to the public.”

“They’re not quite ready to go, though, which is why we’re only announcing the project now. We’re going to need help from independent pilots to finish off the prototypes and get a manufacturing base set up.”

The designs would improve the effectiveness of both the fixed and turreted AX multi-cannon and missile rack designs. A gimballed AX multi-cannon is also scheduled, with a campaign to introduce this coming next week.

Details about each weapon’s project is available from most mission boards.

### Chase Admits Kingfisher Mission ‘A Mistake’

Congressman Dalton Chase has made a public statement regretting his involvement with the Thargoid Advocacy Project.

Chase became a member of Congress after an electoral campaign focusing on inter-species diplomatic relations. He was a key organiser and fundraiser for the Kingfisher megaship, which attempted to open communications with the Taranis entity but was subsequently destroyed with no survivors.

In a press statement delivered from Olympus Village on Mars, Congressman Chase announced:

“The tragic fate that befell the Kingfisher has affected me deeply. I now recognise that sourcing the means for those activists to intercept Taranis was, however well intentioned, a mistake. Such an endeavour should not have been attempted by inexperienced citizens, no matter their courage and tenacity.”

“In honour of those brave people, I pledge to focus on proposals to introduce xeno-diplomacy as Federal policy. Rather than civilians needing to risk their lives, we should be bringing such operations to the Federal Navy at a congressional level.”

Secretary of State Lana Berkovich has petitioned Congress to launch an investigation into Chase’s involvement with the xeno-peace movement. She described his role in the loss of over 3,000 lives as “beyond reckless”.

Although the Thargoid Advocacy Project has faltered following the Kingfisher incident, some of its core members were recently involved in organising anti-authoritarian rallies. According to former spokesperson Timothy Culver:

“The superpowers’ involvement in the massacre at HIP 22460, when they supported Salvation’s attempted xenocide, makes them responsible for the Thargoids launching this counterstrike. We need to bring our leaders to account.”

### Carnage Wrought by Further Maelstroms

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The rogue signal sources Cocijo and Oya have arrived at their estimated destinations.

Their impact mirrored that of the Taranis, Indra and Leigong Maelstroms. A total of 16 neighbouring systems were immediately overwhelmed by Thargoid fleets, which launched devastating bombardments against orbital starports and planetary infrastructure.

Other inhabited systems in the vicinity are resisting occupation. Superpower capital ships and independent pilots are currently battling to protect the local populations.

Five rogue signal sources have now manifested as Maelstroms, with three more approaching at faster-than-light speed. Many systems have completely fallen to the Thargoids in the vicinity of each Maelstrom. Safeguard Interstellar reported that millions of refugees are threatening to overwhelm emergency services and rescue teams. Military forces are also struggling to contain the enormous numbers of Thargoid vessels.

Professor Alba Tesreau is one of many xenologists and other specialists trying to learn more about the mysterious Maelstroms. She gave a brief update to Vox Galactica:

“Full-scale war with the Thargoids has always been my greatest fear. It is now a reality. It’s more crucial than ever that we obtain an understanding of this species, particularly these powerful new entities deployed against humanity.”

“Seo Jin-ae, who possesses a base comprehension of Thargoid intent via her neural implants, believes these are focused, systematic strikes rather than a frenzied assault. She feels that the Thargoids are working toward a specific goal, but cannot yet identify its nature.”

“The one advantage given to us by the arrival of further Maelstroms is the potential that Thargoid forces will be distributed more evenly across systems. With an expanded front line, defensive efforts may gain additional traction when defending or recapturing systems from the aliens.”

In related news, Azimuth Biotech’s new anti-xeno megaship has entered service in the T Tauri system. Eternal Vigilance was commissioned following an initiative in November, which was challenged by a counter-campaign aiming to prevent the corporation’s resurgence.

### The Darkest Days

Newsfeeds have published their reactions as the Thargoid Maelstroms launch fleets to overpower multiple inhabited systems.

Sol Today: “Be in no doubt: we are in a war for survival! Dark days are upon us. No more ridiculous ideas of peace with the aliens. No more time for politics or debate. The Thargoids have come to wipe us out unless we stand up and fight.”

Old Worlds Gazette: “This is the most severe Thargoid attack ever recorded. Hundreds of thousands slaughtered. Millions more fleeing their homes. Stations and planetary ports bombarded, entire star systems conquered… all in a few days. Many fear that nowhere will be safe if these savage onslaughts cannot be halted.”

Citizens' Chronicle: “The speed with which our navy responded to defend Imperial citizens against the Thargoids must be applauded. However, it is becoming harder to ignore the screams from less fortunate systems. Might their cries melt our Emperor’s heart enough for her to consider extending the Empire’s protective wings?”

The Empirical: “The hazardous nature of the Maelstroms has challenged all efforts at scientific examination. In terms of scale and composition they resemble small nebulae yet are surely artificial. Their highly corrosive clouds share chemical signatures with known Thargoid technology, but prevent all scans from identifying what generates them.”

The Sovereign: “The Kingfisher tragedy has been eclipsed by the current conflicts, but one detail we felt worthy of note was the discovery of Thargoid Sensors among the megaship’s wreckage. The leading theory is that one of the volunteer crewmembers smuggled these aboard, in the hope of attracting the Thargoids’ attention to the megaship’s peaceful communications. This misguided individual was likely unaware that Thargoid vessels can become hostile upon detecting their technology on human ships. One hopes that nothing more sinister was in play.”

## 15 DEC

### Enhanced AX Weapon Update

Pilots’ Federation ALERT

The continued project to provide enhanced AX weaponry for all ships has announced its latest progress update.

Independent pilots have been tasked with establishing a manufacturing base at select locations in the core systems. Thanks to these focused efforts, the following weapons are now available for purchase:

Enhanced AX Multi-cannon (Turreted)

Enhanced AX Missile Rack (Turreted)

Enhanced AX Multi-cannon (Fixed)

These modules are offered at all rescue megaships, which can be found using the Galaxy Map filter. Ships looking to engage Thargoid forces are advised to equip these weapons, particularly in Maelstrom systems where Guardian-based technology has proven ineffective.

Work continues on the other enhanced weapons, based on designs by the engineers Liz Ryder and Zacariah Nemo which improve the original Aegis models. A further update will be provided next Thursday, unless no additional modules have been established during the week.

### Corrs Toy Emporium Calls for Help

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

Sandra Corrs, CEO of the largest manufacturer of children’s toys in the core systems, has requested help this holiday season.

Many parents will be familiar with Sandra’s Workshop, recognising the company logo stamped across countless datapads, interactive suites and tactile play sets designed for youngsters. But the joy of this year’s festive season is at risk, with the recent Thargoid invasion impacting the Workshop’s distribution chain.

In an interview with Vox Galactica, Corrs explained:

“We typically use a fleet of transports provided by our partner company, Dolph’s Routes, to deliver presents to good children all across the bubble. But those transports have been assigned to provide evacuation support to 63 Tauri. Entirely understandable, and I applaud the company for its brave work. But it does leave many presents without a sleigh, as my grandfather used to say!”

“I’m hoping that independent pilots will fill the vacancy left to deliver festive gifts to the children in time for the upcoming holidays. Arrangements will be made to provide a variety of wonderful rewards for those pilots who help keep youthful spirits high in these troubling times.”

Pilots willing to help Sandra’s Workshop can collect festive gifts from the Frost Dock outpost in the Njambalba system. A beacon outside Frost Dock will distribute delivery information when scanned.

### Final Maelstroms Advance Thargoid Occupation

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

A further 13 systems have fallen under Thargoid control as the last of the Maelstroms materialise.

The three rogue signal sources – designated Thor, Raijin and Hadad – entered human-occupied space yesterday. As with the previous five anomalies, they manifested as colossal clouds of corrosive gas over 100 kilometres in diameter.

Pilots who attempt to investigate the Maelstroms have been warned that the highly caustic nature of the clouds can disable and destroy ships. Xenologists have speculated that the cloud is a defensive asset, maintained by the huge numbers of caustic generators clustered within.

All eight Maelstroms are now established at their destinations, positioned in a broad semi-circle along the fringe of the core systems. Each of these entities has become the centre of an expanding Thargoid sphere of influence. Populated systems in the surrounding regions have been dominated by extremely hostile Thargoid vessels, causing enormous casualties and catastrophic damage. Many more inhabited systems are at risk of invasion.

Eleven rescue megaships have entered service at key locations to aid and process the millions of refugees fleeing these attacks. These ships also act as hubs for defence operations to support those systems struggling to resist the Thargoid fleets.The Alliance, Empire and Federation have deployed capital ships equipped with anti-xeno weaponry to defend their respective territories. As yet there appears to be no technology or strategy capable of engaging the ominous power of the Maelstroms directly.

## 19 DEC

### The Supercruise Factor

Thargoid vessels are interdicting human ships travelling through systems that have been occupied by their fleets.

The Thargoids’ ability to force craft to drop out of hyperspace is well documented. Over the past couple of weeks, pilots have reported that the interdiction ability used by human ships in supercruise is also being utilised by the alien forces.

Colonel Bris Dekker, an engineer who specialises in frame shift drive technology, submitted his analysis to The Federal Times:

“Being intercepted by the Thargoids mid-way through an interstellar journey is certainly a disturbing experience, but not necessarily a fatal one. Many ships have survived such encounters, unless they happen to be carrying Guardian or Thargoid artefacts. By contrast, these more recent incidents are uniformly acts of aggression, with ships being wrenched out of supercruise and immediately fired upon.”

“We don’t know precisely how the Thargoids achieve this, though some theories are gathering support. But the intention is clear: to make the hunting of humans vessels easier. Anti-xeno pilots should note that they can no longer escape the Thargoid blasting though their shields by simply entering supercruise.”

“Possibly, this is more of a shift in tactics than a new technological development. All reported interdictions have taken place in recently invaded systems close to the Maelstroms, rather than in the aliens’ more well-known haunts. Whatever the reason, the invading Thargoid force has adapted to more efficiently catch its prey.”

### The Voice of the Empire

On the Empire’s homeworld Capitol, fears over imminent Thargoid invasion sparked a public gathering outside the Imperial Palace.

Cassia Carvalho, political journalist for The Imperial Herald, reported from the scene:

“The arrival of the Thargoid Maelstroms has triggered protests on many Allied, Federal and independent worlds. The Empire is rarely troubled by such disruption, so the spontaneous march by tens of thousands of citizens through Capitol’s streets caught the media and security services by surprise.”

“Chancellor Anders Blaine addressed the crowd, his image projected above us all. He spoke of the Imperial Navy’s swift response to the Thargoid threat, making assurances that our systems were protected and we were all safe.”

“But this wasn’t enough to quell the increasingly strident demands that more should be done. I saw anger, frustration and fear etched into those shouting faces. The newsfeed images of burning and broken starports, of Thargoid vessels laying waste to ordinary people’s homes, were all too clear in everyone’s minds.”

“I genuinely wasn’t sure which way this impromptu demonstration would go. Might the crowd’s strong emotions even transmute into violence? And then a new voice rang out across the square: the unmistakable tones of Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval herself, standing tall as she slowly descended the palace steps toward us.”

“‘Remember this: we are Imperials,’ she told her people, her commanding voice amplified for all to hear. The crowd parted in silence as she neared, allowing her to stride amongst us. ‘We possess the strongest civilisation, the grandest achievements, and the most courageous hearts. We shall meet anything that dares to threaten us, human or alien, and we will defeat it. Our Empire will endure!”

“By the end of her address, which lasted some ten minutes, emotions had indeed been transmuted – into exultant, cheering jubilation. Our Emperor had stood with us in person, reminded us all of our heritage and our duty. The Thargoids will undoubtedly come. But in that moment we were determined to face them together.”

## 26 DEC

### Winters: ‘Federation Must Protect Independents’

Shadow President Felicia Winters has called for the Federal Navy to help defend independent systems being invaded by the Thargoids.

She outlined her viewpoint during an interview with the Federal Free Press:

“The Thargoid fleets emerging from the Maelstroms have inflicted anguish and loss on millions. Our military forces have responded magnificently, and continue to fight hard against appalling odds. But while they are saving lives in Federal-aligned systems, independent systems are left to suffer.”

“Surely this cannot be right? These are our neighbours, our trading partners, our historic cousins. Their populations cry out for help, and the mighty Federal Navy chooses to ignore them, claiming orders to prioritise saving our own. Is that who we are now? No better than the Empire?”

“I have argued in Congress that we have a duty of responsibility to protect any independent systems lacking the ability to defend themselves from Thargoid attacks. The Federal Navy’s resources are finite, I understand that. But we are fighting to determine the future of the human race. We lack proof that the Thargoids have any concept of our politics, borders or allegiances. Why would they care which systems claim allegiance to whom? Every one of us is a target.”

“And for those whose hearts are hardened to the suffering of others, think on this: the threat is moving closer each day. Leaving non-Federal factions to fend for themselves – and most likely become conquered – will only hasten the Thargoids’ advance. Before long, nowhere within the Federation will be safe. We will all pay the price for such callousness.”

## 27 DEC

### The Time for Aegis?

Professor Alba Tesreau has again called for the anti-xeno initiative Aegis to be reformed by the superpowers.

“The arrival of the Maelstroms has escalated the Second Thargoid War beyond anything we have experienced before. The Thargoids are relentlessly attacking every human settlement within reach. And that reach is steadily expanding on eight fronts, spreading deeper into the core systems.”

“In these dire circumstances, the decision to shut down Aegis seems to be a grave mistake. Now, more than ever, superpower-level resources are needed to establish large-scale research and defence projects. This is the surely the time for Aegis to be revived with as much funding and resources as possible.”

“My symposium in October proved that there is an increasing appetite for collaboration. Many Allied and Federal military leaders have already discussed working together. Shadow President Winters recently suggested helping those beyond Federal borders, and Deputy Prime Minister Corcoran has championed the prospect of coalition in the Alliance.”

“Sadly, the Empire’s current isolationist policy means that Aegis would necessitate a return as a dual-superpower initiative. But even that would be an improvement on the fractured, uncoordinated response to the Thargoid conquests.”

There has been no official response to Professor Tesreau from the Alliance or Federation, but several individual congressmen and council members have repeated their support for the reformation of Aegis.

In the Empire, only the Citizens’ Chronicle newsfeed reported on Tesreau’s ongoing campaign, commenting: “Even among the Imperial nobility, few dare to question the Emperor’s decree. But those few are growing bolder.”

## 29 DEC

### Enhanced AX Weapon Update

\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\*

The continued project to provide enhanced AX weaponry for all ships has announced its latest progress update.

All enhanced AX weapons designed by the engineers Liz Ryder and Zacariah Nemo have now been completed. It is hoped that with these weapons improvements, humanity will be better positioned to defend itself against Thargoid invasion fleets.

The following weapons are now available for purchase:

Enhanced AX Multi-cannon (Gimballed)

Enhanced AX Missile Rack (Fixed)

These modules are offered at all rescue megaships, which can be found using the Galaxy Map filter. Ships looking to engage Thargoid forces are advised to equip these weapons, particularly in Maelstrom systems where Guardian-based technology has proven ineffective.

### A Retrospective of 3308 (Part Two)

Sima Kalhana continues her review of the most significant historical events that occurred during the past year.

“In May 3308, the Thargoid invasions of the Didio, Novas and Sosong systems were completely repelled by the use of Salvation’s unique superweapons. This convinced the Alliance, Empire and Federation to support Azimuth Biotech in developing this Guardian-based technology, with Salvation claiming that he could end the Thargoid threat forever.”

“Elsewhere that month, the Kumo Crew syndicate faced civil war as pirate rebels tried to replace Archon Delaine. Eventually his loyal forces triumphed, with the Blue Viper Club dredger clan fleeing his reprisals. And in the Federation, trillionaire entrepreneur Zachary Rackham announced his presidential candidacy for the 3309 election.”

“June saw the Golconda generation ship repaired and updated by the Artificers Clan. This provided the majority of its original inhabitants, descended from Earth colonists, the opportunity to resume their spacefaring lifestyle.”

“The news around this time was dominated by Salvation, particularly when he rebranded Taurus Mining Ventures as Azimuth Biotech. The scientist, once named Dr Caleb Wycherley, admitted that the corporation had evolved out of the notorious Azimuth Biochemicals. But Allied, Federal and Imperial leaders chose to ignore this, having pinned their anti-xeno strategy on Salvation’s superweapon technology.”

“HIP 22460 was the system chosen to construct the Proteus Wave. This interfaced Guardian technology with a Thargoid ground settlement, and was designed to deliberately attract the Thargoids before wiping them out. During July and August, upgraded capital ships along with independent pilots defended Azimuth Biotech’s operation from swarms of Thargoid vessels.”

“After weeks of intense combat and delivering vital supplies, the Proteus Wave was activated on 9th August. Initially it seemed successful, rendering the Thargoids powerless, but an unexpected second energy pulse from the planetary site had the same effect on all human ships. The resulting massacre saw the Thargoids take control of the HIP 22460 system, establishing a permanent presence.”

“Salvation was dead. Azimuth Biotech’s plans had failed. The superpowers were in retreat. And speculation grew about an unearthly alien screech heard in HIP 22460, dubbed the ‘Thargoid roar’.”
