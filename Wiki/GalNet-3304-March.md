### Lakon Releases Alliance Chieftain

The Alliance has announced a new combat ship, the Alliance Chieftain, which has been specifically designed to counter the aggression of the Thargoids.

A press release from Lakon Spaceways, which has developed the ship, stated:

“The Chieftain is a highly manoeuvrable vessel for its size and weight, offering an advantage against the renowned agility of Thargoid craft. It boasts six weapon hardpoints and also has three internal military compartments. This makes it very capable in a combat situation, and able to withstand considerable punishment.”

“We believe demand will be high.”

The Alliance Chieftain is now available for purchase.

### Federal-Imperial Operation Concludes

Admiral Denton Patreus has announced that the joint Federal-Imperial operation in the Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7 and Arietis Sector XE-Z b4 systems has succeeded in achieving its objectives. Scores of independent pilots supported the campaign by eliminating Thargoids, and by recovering black boxes and personal effects from Thargoid attack sites.

As the campaign drew to a close, Admiral Denton Patreus released a statement, thanking those who participated.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Orcus Crag in the Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7 system and PRE Logistics Support Beta in the Arietis Sector XE-Z b4 system.

### Arming Colonia

Arek Crimson Vision Corporation has launched a campaign to boost Colonia’s military strength by providing the region with weapons. The initiative is a direct response to ongoing Thargoid hostility.

A spokesperson for Arek Crimson Vision Corporation elaborated on the nature of the campaign:

“Several members of our organisation have friends and family in Colonia, so we’ve decided to divert some cash into protecting the region. If the Thargoids come knocking, we don’t want the people of Colonia to be caught with their pants down.”

Arek Crimson Vision Corporation has placed an open order for a range of weapons, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver the requested goods to Gold Hub in the Arek system.

The campaign begins on the 1st of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

### Protecting Colonia

As the Thargoid offensive continues, authorities in Colonia have decided to step up security by building a new security installation in the region.

A spokesperson for the Colonia Council, which is overseeing the initiative, gave the following statement:

“The Thargoids have now entered the core systems, and their hostility shows no signs of abating. Meanwhile, Colonia’s defensive capabilities remain limited. It is clear to us that the time to act has come.”

Colonia has agreed to fund the operation, and has placed an open order for various mined resources for use in the construction. Pilots who deliver the requested resources to Dove Enigma in the Colonia system will be generously compensated.

The campaign begins on the 1st of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

## 04 MAR

### Week in Review

Here are this week’s major stories.

Reports from independent pilots confirm that a new type of Thargoid vessel has been encountered, both in the Pleiades and on the fringes of the core systems. The ship, designated a Thargoid Scout Marauder by the Pilots Federation, are reported to be more manoeuvrable than the Thargoid Interceptor, but less resistant to weapons fire.

Meanwhile, analytical reports released by Aegis have confirmed a pattern to the Thargoids’ recent starport attacks, which have left thousands dead and infrastructures crippled. Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis’s chief military liaison, confirmed that the Thargoids are specifically targeting starports where Aegis laboratories are established. Defensive measures have been increased at all starports where Aegis has a presence.

Authorities in Colonia have decided to step up security by building a new security installation in the region. The Arek Crimson Vision Corporation has launched a parallel campaign to boost Colonia’s military strength by providing the region with weapons. Both initiatives are a direct response to ongoing Thargoid hostility.

Finally, Admiral Denton Patreus has announced that the joint Federal-Imperial operation in the Pleiades Sector OI-T c3-7 and Arietis Sector XE-Z b4 systems has succeeded in achieving its objectives. Scores of independent pilots supported the campaign by eliminating Thargoids, and by recovering black boxes and personal effects from Thargoid attack sites.

And those are the main stories this week.

### Ram Tah Announces New Discoveries

The engineer Ram Tah has revealed that his recent request for pilots to investigate possible Guardian sites has yielded significant discoveries. He has released this statement:

“Thanks to many courageous Commanders, we have found several new Guardian sites and recovered a great deal of data. As I theorised, the ruins are not as dead as they seem, since some are actively defended by ancient Guardian drones.”

“My analysis of the data has yielded key technological information, much of which can be put to immediate practical use. This has allowed me to produce blueprints for new weaponry and power-plant systems based on Guardian designs.”

“I am currently liaising with technology brokers to manufacture and distribute these devices, which I hope will benefit the galaxy in these troubled times.”

Ram Tah added that he will continue to rely on the galactic community’s support in unearthing further knowledge about the Guardians.

## 08 MAR

### The Guardians: The Galaxy Reacts

There has been a range of reactions to the discovery of new Guardian sites, and to Ram Tah’s development of Guardian-inspired technologies.

Federal President Zachary Hudson said: “The Federation congratulates Ram Tah on his success. Anything that helps us defend our citizens from Thargoid aggression is welcome.”

Imperial Admiral Denton Patreus echoed this sentiment: “I am pleased to hear that new, more powerful armaments are being produced. These will provide a tactical advantage in our conflict with the Thargoids.”

Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon struck a more balanced tone: “Information is wealth, and Ram Tah’s efforts to expand the boundaries of science and knowledge will make us rich indeed.”

Meanwhile, Simguru Pranav Antal of Utopia looked to the future: “There is enormous potential for humanity to benefit from the technology of our galactic predecessors, and we look forward to sharing whatever prosperity these new discoveries may bring.”

Finally, Professor Alba Tesreau, head of research at Aegis, commented: “I have already contacted Ram Tah with the hope that Aegis can study his new data. Understanding more about the Guardians may enhance our knowledge of the Thargoids, and perhaps help us to comprehend their motives.”

## 09 MAR

### Coalition of Othime Campaign

The Coalition of Othime has announced plans to develop refinery facilities in its home system through the construction of a new asteroid base.

A spokesperson for the Coalition said:

“Othime relies heavily on its refineries, but those refineries are limited to small and medium cargo vessels, which limits the amount of revenue we can generate. A new asteroid base would allow us to support large ships, such as the Anaconda and Imperial Cutter, and allow us to compete with other refineries in the sector.”

The organisation has placed an open order for various commodities, and has placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list to ensure that those contributing material to the campaign can do so safely. Pilots who contribute to the initiative will be generously rewarded.

The campaign begins on 8th of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

### Colonia Initiative Concludes

The Colonia Council has announced that its campaign to build a security installation in the Colonia region has been warmly received by the galactic community. Large quantities of material were delivered to Dove Enigma over the past week, allowing the initiative to move to the construction phase.

A spokesperson for the Colonia Council, which is overseeing the campaign, gave the following statement:

“The new installation will help us protect the people of Colonia from the ever-escalating Thargoid threat. Our thanks go to those who supported the campaign.”

### Arek Crimson Vision Corporation Campaign Ends

A spokesperson for Arek Crimson Vision Corporation has announced that its appeal for weapons has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community, resulting in a massive influx of deliveries to the organisation’s base of operations. The weapons will now be shipped to the Colonia region.

As the campaign drew to a close, a spokesperson for Arek Crimson Vision Corporation issued a statement thanking those who supported the campaign.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Gold Hub in the Arek system.

## 10 MAR

### Thargoid Surveillance in the Pleiades

Aegis has launched an operation to monitor Thargoid activity in the Pleiades Nebula.

Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison at Aegis, made this statement:

“Our new Eagle Eye initiative will closely monitor systems where Thargoid surface sites are known to exist.”

“We have established orbital surveillance installations at six locations in the Pleiades, which will measure energy-level fluctuations and track ship movements. Each installation is attended by a comms beacon that will collect the data before transmitting it to us for analysis.”

Aegis has confirmed that Eagle Eye installations have been placed in the following systems:

HIP 17225

HIP 17692

HIP 17892

HR 1185

Pleiades Sector IR-W d1-55

Pleiades Sector KC-V c2-4

Professor Alba Tesreau commented:

“My hope is that this initiative will greatly increase our knowledge of the Thargoids. Observing their ‘natural’ activities, outside of combat zones, should further our understanding of their behaviour.”

### Week in Review

Here are this week’s major stories.

Several new Guardian sites have been discovered, resulting in a wealth of fresh information about the Guardians’ long-lost civilisation. Some of this information has already been put to practical use by the engineer Ram Tah, who has produced blueprints for new weaponry and power-plant systems based on Guardian designs.

Several galactic figureheads reacted to the news. Federal President Zachary Hudson said: “Anything that helps us defend our citizens from Thargoid aggression is welcome”, while Imperial Admiral Denton Patreus expressed hope that the new armaments would “provide a tactical advantage in our conflict with the Thargoids”.

Meanwhile, Aegis has launched an operation to monitor Thargoid activity in the Pleiades Nebula. The tri-superpower initiative has established orbital surveillance installations at six locations in the Pleiades as part of the Eagle Eye initiative. The installations will monitor systems where Thargoid surface sites are known to exist.

Finally, the Coalition of Othime has announced plans to develop refinery facilities in its home system through the construction of a new asteroid base. The organisation hopes that the new base will allow it to compete with other refineries in the region.

And those are the main stories this week.

## 11 MAR

### Fresh Knowledge From New Guardian Sites

Following the recent discovery of new Guardian sites, the engineer Ram Tah is seeking help from the galactic community to learn more about the long-lost civilisation.

Further details were outlined in his latest announcement:

“I have developed a decryption algorithm that will translate the codices at Guardian sites. However, pilots are reminded that accessing Guardian data is only possible when in possession of one of their artefacts.”

Pilots can obtain Ram Tah’s decryption algorithm from any station in the Meene system other than Felice Dock. The artefacts alluded to by Ram Tah can be found at Guardian sites. Commanders are warned to be on alert, as the sites may be defended by Guardian drones.

Ram Tah also stated: “I will be more than pleased to reimburse any pilot who successfully returns to the Meene system with a complete series of Guardian logs. There is so much more for us to discover about the Guardians and their history, and this could be a significant turning point in our understanding.”

## 16 MAR

### The Purge of Socho

Following reports of Thargoid incursions into the core systems, Aegis Core has launched a counter-Thargoid operation in the Socho region.

A spokesperson for Aegis Core gave the following statement to the media:

“The goal is simple: Take out Thargoid vessels, gather up the pieces, and deliver them to Dantec Enterprise. We don’t know as much about the Scouts as we do the Interceptors, so we want to compare materials from both variants and find out what they are made of.”

Aegis Core has appealed to independent pilots to support the operation by destroying Thargoids in Socho and by delivering Bio-Mechanical Conduits, Propulsion Elements and Weapon Parts to Dantec Enterprise. Commanders who participate in the operation will be generously rewarded.

The campaign begins on the 15th of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

### Coalition of Othime Campaign Concludes

The Coalition of Othime has announced that its campaign to build a new asteroid base has received the wholehearted support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the appeal by delivering commodities to Levi Montalcini Dock and by eliminating agitators in Othime, thereby ensuring the safety of traders.

Authorities in Othime have extended their gratitude to those who participated in the operation.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Levi-Montalcini Dock in the Othime system.

## 17 MAR

### Thargoid Surveillance Continues

According to Aegis, their operation to monitor Thargoid activity in the Pleiades Nebula has already begun to show results.

Aegis released the following statement on behalf of Admiral Aden Tanner, their chief military liaison:

“The new Eagle Eye installations are a success, they have identified fluctuations in Thargoid transmissions from a number of planet side structures. With the invaluable help of the members of the Pilots Federation we have identified that the new signals are pointing to locations in human space. We believe these to be identifying the location of potential Thargoid attacks and if this is proved to be the case it will be a huge break through and a validation of our work here.

We continue to monitor the Thargoid activity using the Eagle Eye installations in the Pleiades and have confirmed reports that the Eagle Eye installations have detected new signals. We urge all available pilots to investigate these changes to see if we can thwart the Thargoids.”

### Non Human Signal Sources in Huveang De

Local security services in the Huveang De system have announced today that there have been no new sightings of Thargoids over the last 24 hours.

The head of local security forces released the following statement:

“We do not know why the Thargoids appeared in our region of space or why they now appear to have left. We can only speculate as to their motives. However we thank all the brave pilots that came to the system to help defend against this potentially catastrophic threat.”

There is speculation that the Thargoids planned to attack the system and were held back by the influx of combat pilots engaging them, while others claim that the Thargoids might be exploring or looking for resources and have simply moved on.

While no one has reported any further sighting in nearby systems, security forces in the region remain on high alert.

## 23 MAR

### Socho Operation Complete

The operation to clear Socho of Thargoids has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of pilots supported the campaign by eliminating Thargoid vessels in the system, and by delivering alien material to Dantec Enterprise.

A spokesperson for Aegis Core, which oversaw the initiative, made the following statement:

“The pilots who took part in the operation have my thanks – they showed some real mettle. I can’t promise the material they delivered will lead to any momentous discoveries, but you never know.”

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Dantec Enterprise in the Socho system.

### Sirius Corp Announces Expansion

The Sirius Corporation has announced that it will be expanding its presence at two locations just outside the core systems.

A spokesperson for Sirius made this statement:

“For some time now, the amount of traffic passing through both the Ceos and Sothis systems has been steadily increasing. Naturally, we are keen to ensure that all pilots have access to essential services.”

“To this end, we are in the process of building several new starports and settlements in these systems, as well as several megaships. These will support Ceos and Sothis’s residents and visitors, and provide pilots with the high standard of services that they have come to expect from Sirius Corp.”

### EG Union Campaign

Yuri Grom has announced an initiative to create a new shipyard in the CPC 20 6743 system. The shipyard will produce capital ships with which to defend human space from both human and alien threats.

The EG Union, acting on behalf of Yuri Grom, has placed an open order for various commodities to build the shipyard, and has promised to reward pilots who deliver these commodities to Lyakhov Dock in the CPC 20 6743 system. The organisation has also placed a kill order on all ships on its wanted list, to ensure that pilots delivering commodities can do so safely.

The spokesperson elaborated on the nature of the campaign:

“Recent events have demonstrated that humanity is not prepared for a possible Thargoid invasion. Building a shipyard for Farragut-class ships is the first step in establishing a defensive perimeter.”

“It is essential that traders do not encounter any difficulty when delivering materials, which is why the EG Pilots – Yuri Grom's elite task force – have been asked to eliminate any agitators. We are also asking independent combat pilots to help us neutralise any threats.”

The campaign begins on the 22nd of March 3304 and will run for one week. If the final target is met earlier than planned, the campaign will end immediately.

### Thargoid Revelations

Aegis has published a report containing significant insights into the Thargoids. The information was provided by the engineer Ram Tah, compiled from recently decrypted logs found at Guardian sites.

Key extracts from the report are reprinted below:

“The codices indicate that the Thargoids may be an older race than the Guardians, and that the two species share a history of conflict. This hostility was a product of the Thargoids’ belief that they had a pre-existing claim to the regions of space occupied by the Guardians.”

“The Guardians attempted to communicate with the Thargoids, but these efforts ended in failure. They determined that the Thargoids’ survival instincts were so strong that they could not tolerate any potential threat, including the proximity of another space-faring civilisation.”

“It is now clear that the Guardians’ defensive drones and advanced weaponry were developed principally to protect their worlds from the Thargoids. Although details are scant, it seems these war machines eventually succeeded in repelling the Thargoids.”

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of research at Aegis, publicly commented on the report:

“Thanks to Ram Tah and the brave pilots who explored Guardian sites, some of our questions about the Thargoids have been answered. It is clear that our current situation echoes that of the Guardians. Our space, like theirs, was seeded with barnacles thousands of years ago, and now the Thargoids have arrived to reap the biomechanical harvest.”

“We now know that the purpose of the Thargoids’ ongoing military offensive is to remove humanity from what they consider their territory. If the Thargoids adopt the same modus operandi as with the Guardians, their next move will be to start aggressively mining mineral resources. There is no evidence this has yet begun, however.”

Ram Tah has also made a statement about the impact of the findings:

“Until now, the Thargoids have been shrouded in mystery, and their objectives have been unclear. For the first time, we have an insight into what drives them, why they are attacking us, and what their overall goals are. This is a historically significant discovery that I believe will make a huge difference to this conflict, and perhaps to humanity’s survival.”

### Week in Review

Here are this week’s major stories.

Aegis has published a report containing significant insights into the Thargoids. The information was provided by the engineer Ram Tah, compiled from recently decrypted logs at Guardian sites. The report indicates that the Guardians and the Thargoids were once at war, due to the Thargoids’ belief that they had a pre-existing claim to the regions of space occupied by the Guardians. Professor Alba Tesreau, head of research at Aegis, said: “It is clear that our current situation echoes that of the Guardians. Our space, like theirs, was seeded with barnacles thousands of years ago, and now the Thargoids have arrived to reap the biomechanical harvest.”

The Aegis report has elicited a wide range of responses. Federal President Zachary Hudson said, “It is now clear that there is no reasoning with this alien menace”, while Imperial Admiral Denton Patreus commented, “This new information makes it clear that the Thargoids will reject any diplomatic overtures. We must redouble our efforts to defend ourselves from their antagonism.”

Meanwhile, the operation to clear Socho of Thargoids has reached a successful conclusion. Scores of pilots supported the campaign by eliminating Thargoid vessels in the system, and by delivering alien material to Dantec Enterprise.

### Aegis Thargoid Report Causes Ripples

A recent report from Aegis, outlining the Thargoids’ history and their interactions with the Guardians, has elicited a wide range of responses.

A brief statement was released by Federal President Zachary Hudson:

“It is now clear that there is no reasoning with this alien menace. The Federation remains dedicated to wiping out any threat to our citizens.”

Imperial Admiral Denton Patreus adopted a similar viewpoint:

“This new information makes it clear that the Thargoids will reject any diplomatic overtures. We must redouble our efforts to defend ourselves from their antagonism.”

Meanwhile, Professor Palin observed:

“Aegis’s report forewarns us, and perhaps forearms us, too. We now know that the Guardians developed technologies capable of resisting the Thargoids’ aggression. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to hope that the weaponry being developed by Ram Tah, based on Guardian designs, might help us replicate the Guardians’ success, and defeat the Thargoids.”

## 30 MAR

### Thargoid Sites Go Quiet

Admiral Aden Tanner, Aegis’s chief military liaison, has released a statement concerning the Thargoid structures currently under surveillance in the Pleiades Nebula.

“Undoubtedly, the most positive outcome of our Eagle Eye initiative is that it has allowed us to determine which locations the Thargoids intend to attack. This has proved invaluable in our ongoing fight against the Thargoids.”

“It appears, however, that the sites are currently dormant, as no energy-level fluctuations have been detected for several days. Hopefully this means we can look forward to a temporary reprieve from Thargoid attacks.”

“Our military flagships, the Vanguard and the Acropolis, will remain on standby in HIP 21559 and Irandan until needed.”

### Conflict in Ross 310

Conflict has erupted between Ross 310 Natural Services, the controlling faction of the Ross 310 system, and the Ross 310 Cartel, a criminal organisation also based in Ross 310.

It is understood that the Ross 310 Cartel is attempting to overthrow Ross 310 Natural Services and assume control of the system.

Toru Jacobs, a member of Ross 310 Natural Services, issued the following statement:

“The Ross 310 Cartel is well equipped and highly organised, and there’s a very real chance they could take control of the system. But the brave men and women of Ross 310 Natural Services are doing everything they can to prevent that from happening.”

Both organisations have issued calls for aid, appealing to independent combat pilots for support. Commanders who participate in the conflict will be generously rewarded by their chosen faction.

Both factions have set out week-long operations to take control of the system, which will begin on the 29th of March 3304.

### EG Union Campaign Concludes

The EG Union has announced that its campaign to build a shipyard in CPC 20 6743 has received the wholehearted support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Lyakhov Dock, and by eliminating agitators in Ross 720 and surrounding systems, thereby ensuring the safety of traders.

Pilots who contributed to the initiative can now collect their rewards from Lyakhov Dock in the CPC 20 6743 system.

## 31 MAR

### Week in Review

Here are this week’s major stories.

Aegis has constructed two megaships, the Acropolis and the Vanguard, to help counter the Thargoid threat. These ships will coordinate anti-Thargoid operations and support independent pilots. Aegis has confirmed that both vessels will periodically relocate to wherever they can be strategically effective.

Meanwhile, many members of the Pilots Federation have responded to the recent Aegis report detailing the Thargoids’ history. One Commander admitted he was disturbed to discover that the Thargoids had been around for millions of years, and that even the Guardians had found it difficult to stop them. But other pilots were more forthright, with one reminding the galactic community that the Thargoids are not invincible.

In other news, conflict has erupted between Ross 310 Natural Services, the controlling faction of the Ross 310 system, and the Ross 310 Cartel, a criminal organisation also based in the region. It is understood that the Ross 310 Cartel is attempting to overthrow Ross 310 Natural Services and assume control of the system. Both organisations have issued calls for aid, appealing to independent combat pilots for support.

Finally, the EG Union has announced that its campaign to build a shipyard in Ross 720 has received the wholehearted support of the galactic community. Hundreds of pilots supported the initiative by delivering commodities to Lyakhov Dock, and by eliminating agitators in Ross 720 and surrounding systems, thereby ensuring the safety of traders.

And those are the main stories this week.

### Anti-Thargoid Megaships Deployed by Aegis

Aegis has constructed two megaships, the Acropolis and the Vanguard, to help counter the Thargoid threat.

The announcement came from Admiral Aden Tanner, who explained the ships’ purpose:

“It is vital that Aegis has a military presence in the theatre of conflict. These new ships will coordinate anti-Thargoid operations wherever they are deployed, and will support independent pilots.”

“In response to recent Thargoid incursions, the Acropolis has been dispatched to the Lunguni system, while the Vanguard is operating in the Mentor system. However, their key advantage over a starport or base is their mobility, so both will periodically relocate to wherever they can be strategically effective.”

Admiral Tanner went on to stress the importance of the development:

“Constructing these two gigantic vessels was a considerable undertaking for Aegis, but we are convinced the expense and effort is worthwhile. Our remit requires us to occupy a guiding role in the resistance against the Thargoids, and these megaships will bring that into focus.”
