## Location

Genetic Repair Meds are (very) rare. They can be found in Medical rooms (MED), Storage building (STO), restricted building (RES), Industrial buildings (IND), Extraction buildings (EXT), and Agriculture buildings (AGRI). However, it's very rare in such lockers.

You can check locked cabinets of restricted laboratory rooms, which are common in Scientific settlements. Check locker behind a level 3 door in a restricted security section.

This good is also being sold for a much higher than average price.
