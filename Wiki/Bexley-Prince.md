### Occupation

Hollis Gateway Chief Researcher

**Bexley Prince** was a Chief Researcher at the INRA base Hollis Gateway. She gave assignments to the research teams about extremely sensitive work. There were twelve different research projects focused on different things. Pieces of recovered Thargoid technology and spacecraft were researched there. Prince suspected there was a key discovery to be made.^[1]^

Bexley Prince described herself as a perfectionist who set high standards for herself, and became impatient with some of her colleagues when their research failed produce new insights. When a junior researcher with agricultural expertise created a biological agent, mycoid, that unexpectedly incapacitated the alien technology, Prince did not see the value of this discovery and wanted to remove him from the project. However, Prince's employers disagreed and thought the researcher's work had merit.
