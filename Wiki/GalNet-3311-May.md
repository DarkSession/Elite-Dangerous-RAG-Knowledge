### Mining Rivalry Sparks Conflict in LP 855-34

Tensions between Yuri Grom and Felicia Winters have erupted into open conflict around the mining system of LP 855-34. The system’s platinum rush, triggered by local construction demands, has drawn forces from both Powers. Yuri Grom's representative accused Federal factions of "cornering the market" unfairly, urging loyal supporters to counteract the Federation's aggressive tactics. Combat Zones have appeared throughout the region as pilots clash over strategic mining sites. Pilots supporting Yuri Grom are encouraged to report to The Undeniable station in LP 855-34 to assist in industrial mining operations and help push back the Federal forces.

### Winters' Supporters Claim Mining Rush Victory

**A surprisingly tense mining boom in LP 855-34 has concluded, with supporters of Felicia Winters claiming success over Yuri Grom’s pilots.**

A call for Platinum by the system’s governing faction triggered an influx of ships representing the two powers. Longstanding issues between Yuri Grom and the Federation fed into the competitive aspect of the issue, and it is perhaps no surprise that it was the latter who claimed the greatest number of mined resources in the end.

Speaking on behalf of Winters’ support base, a representative gave this statement:

“*The efforts of our mining teams over the past two weeks have been nothing short of remarkable. We provided enough Platinum to ensure that LP 855-34’s governing faction will meet its manifesto building projects. And, just as significantly, we showed that the Federation dominates all competitors in matters of industry!*”

Those who took part in the conflict for either side can now collect their rewards.

Felicia Winters supporters can collect their rewards at Rhea's Resilience.

Yuri Grom supporters can collect their rewards at The Undeniable.

### Alliance Assembly Votes to End Sirius Defence Pact

**The Alliance Assembly has voted to end the strategic defence pact between the Alliance and Sirius Corporation.**

The pact, agreed in January 3308, was a response to growing Thargoid hostility in the months prior to the alien invasion of the core systems. At the time, the Alliance Defence Force was seen as lacking adequate Anti-Xeno modules and defences. Sirius Corporation spent billions on refitting ADF vessels over the past three years, but has been accused of leveraging its position to secure profitable contracts in unrelated fields.

The motion to end the pact was raised by Councilor Nakato Kaine, seconded by Councilor Ainsley Niven of Reorte, and was approved by a slim majority. In her opening argument Kaine had called the pact an ‘*opportunistic ploy for military influence in Alliance space, with eyes on a monopoly over small corporations founded in Alliance member systems*.’

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon had argued in favour of maintaining the pact, pointing out that ‘the recent Thargoid invasion is unlikely to be the last xeno threat we ever see, and the ADF benefits greatly from Sirius Corp’s technology and industrial might.’

Analysts believe that a reduced Sirius Corp presence in Allied military industry and related business will trigger a frantic rush from other companies to fill the supply chain.

Sirius Corporation has not yet issued a statement to the media.

### Trading Blocs Compete in Alliance Space

**Two significant trading blocs have emerged in Alliance territory following the termination of the Strategic Defence Pact.**

Last week, Sirius Corporation was ordered by the Alliance Assembly to reduce its involvement in Allied military infrastructure and logistics. The move, labelled ‘fascinatingly short-sighted' by Sirius Corp CEO Li Yong-Rui, has triggered an economic rush from Allied corporations to grab the lucrative contracts issued as a result.

The two trading blocs have somewhat predictably formed around the two leading voices in the Alliance Assembly – Edmund Mahon and Nakato Kaine.

This marks the latest in a growing series of confrontations between the galaxy's major Powers. In LP 855-34, a contested mining system, Felicia Winters initially secured control by the end of the first week of conflict. However, her success provoked an immediate and forceful response from Yuri Grom's supporters. Conflict zones erupted across the system as Grom's forces pushed back, ultimately overturning Winters' hold and plunging the region back into an unoccupied state.

Mahon’s supporters aim to reinforce the Prime Minister’s position as leader of the Alliance via high levels of trade. A spokesperson said that Mahon ‘*will prevent the economic disaster which Kaine’s Assembly motion has threatened*.’

Meanwhile, Kaine’s supporters claim that ‘the Sirius pact was paper covering the cracks of Mahon’s economic weakness’, pointed to as evidence of ‘Mahon’s over-reliance on megacorporate support to get things done.’ Kaine herself has always advocated for a political shift towards favouring businesses founded in Alliance member systems.

Both trade blocs have asked for shipments of Semiconductors, Ceramic Composites and Synthetic Fabrics.

Trade pilots looking to help Edmund Mahon’s trade bloc can sign up at Bowersox Port in Winiama.

Trade pilots looking to help Nakato Kaine’s trade bloc can sign up at Fuca Dock in Apura.

### Rising Tensions Between Galactic Powers

**Observers across the core systems are reporting an increase in antagonistic activity between Power supporters, with skirmishes flaring in multiple regions.**

In the aftermath of the Thargoid war, political attention has turned inward as human factions seek to reassert dominance across the bubble. Recent clashes, including the conflict between Vice President Jerome Archer and Admiral Denton Patreus, followed by competing mining operations in LP 855-34 between Felicia Winters and Yuri Grom, have prompted concerns from analysts monitoring political dynamics.

A source within the Pilots Federation stated: "*What we're seeing is a shift in posture. Powers that once acted defensively to protect influence are now aggressively expanding, testing the limits of rival claims*."

Military analysts believe that while current flashpoints remain contained to power struggles between individual leaders, the pattern suggests a possible escalation that could strain broader superpower relations.

With a trade war erupting in the past week between prominent Alliance figures Prime Minister Edmund Mahon and Councillor Nakato Kaine, political commentators warn that these confrontations may no longer be isolated events, but early signs of a new era of competition.

Commanders are advised to monitor regional developments closely, as opportunities and incentives to support powers in their offensive activities are likely to increase in the coming weeks.
