**Pi Mensae** is an independent system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. The system is permit-locked, and the permit can be obtained by becoming Allied with the Pi Mensae Brotherhood minor faction in any system where it has a presence.

The Pi Mensae Brotherhood faction was one of 14 permit-holding factions that entered into an agreement on November 24, 3307 to maintain so-called Gatekeeper megaships to preserve interstellar trade regardless of local political shifts. These Gatekeeper megaships would be permanently stationed in systems adjacent to their corresponding permit-locked systems to ensure that pilots could reliably obtain permits. Shephard of the Mighty was deployed in LP 91-140 as the Pi Mensae Brotherhood's Gatekeeper megaship.^[1]^
