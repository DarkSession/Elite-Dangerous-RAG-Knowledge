## Goods & services

Jameson Memorial is noteworthy for offering all ships and almost all modules for purchase in its Outfitting services at a 10% discount. The only modules absent from the station's inventory are Enhanced Performance Thrusters, Class 1 Corrosion Resistant Cargo Racks, and any items procured through Human Technology Brokers, although a Guardian Technology Broker is available and Guardian-tech modules can be purchased after they have been unlocked.

The station is also the exclusive purveyor of the Rare Commodity called Waters of Shintara.
