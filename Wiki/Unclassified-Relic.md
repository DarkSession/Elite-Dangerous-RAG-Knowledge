The **Unclassified Relic** is an unknown artefact which can be produced at Thargoid Surface Sites in Thargoid Devices from Guardian Relics. Although it is of half-Thargoid origin, it does not exhibit the usual corrosive properties of other Thargoid artefacts, so it can be safely stored in normal Cargo Rack.

As of the 19th of August, Ishmael Palin and Ram Tah are currently launching a joint research initiative into the new artefacts, and are accepting deliveries of Unclassified Artefacts at their bases in the Arque and Meene systems respectively.^[1]^ Professor Palin's preliminary studies suggest that exposure to Thargoid influence has somehow realigned the molecular structure of the relic's crystalline elements, resulting in a change in the EM signatures it emits along with the more obvious change in colouration.
