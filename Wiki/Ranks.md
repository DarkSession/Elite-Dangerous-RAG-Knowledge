# Ranks
**Ranks** are earned by successfully completing various activities in *Elite Dangerous*. There are 6 different rank categories. These are overseen by the Pilots Federation which trains, licenses and monitors all independent pilots in the galaxy. The Federal Navy and Imperial Navy both offer ranks with benefits for completing missions.

The **Pilots Federation** ranks all pilots in the galaxy on a scale from Harmless to Elite. A pilot's rank can be improved through trade, exploration, combat, mercenary, exobiologist, and CQC. All players are licensed members of the Pilots Federation and earn progress towards ranks by completing activities related to each of the 6 categories. Players who earn the rank of Elite in Combat, Trader, and Explorer attain the coveted status of "Triple Elite".
