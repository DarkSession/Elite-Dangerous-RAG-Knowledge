A Crashed Thargoid Ship site
 		 	 

    - *For human shipwreck sites, see Shipwreck.*

A **Crashed Thargoid Ship** consists of an ancient Thargoid Interceptor or Scout shipwreck on a planet's surface. The first wreckage site, a Thargoid Interceptor, was discovered in the Pleiades Sector AB-W b2-4 system on August 30, 3302, while the first crashed Thargoid Scout was discovered in HIP 17125 on September 28, 3303. Initially, it was not known or obvious that the sites had any connection to the Thargoids, but on October 14, 3303, Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis confirmed that the crashed ships were definitively Thargoid in origin. Crashed Thargoid Ship sites are concentrated in the Pleiades Nebula and Coalsack Nebula, regions where the Thargoids are known to have an extensive presence.

## Description

"Crashed Thargoid Ship" sites consist of wreckage from a Thargoid Interceptor scattered in a canyon, near a shallow depression caused by the impact. There are fourteen visible pieces of the alien ship, and five distinct types of pieces. Additional pieces may or may not be buried beneath the visible wreckage. Thirteen pieces are external wing-like structures of unknown purpose. The fourteenth and largest piece is ostensibly the central part of the ship, a semi-octagonal "core" with a centralized circular "aperture", also of unknown purpose. While the intact ship has eight of each piece, save for the core, the crash sites seem to be missing some parts. All of the pieces are considerably larger than a Scarab SRV, and the intact ship is approximately between a Python and an Anaconda in diameter.

The circumstances that caused these Thargoid shipwrecks are unknown. The wreckage at all sites bears no obvious signs of weapon damage. Additionally, given the concentration of wreckage in a relatively small area at each site, it is possible that the ships were intact up until they impacted and shattered on their respective planets and moons.

Sites containing crashed Thargoid Scouts feature intact vessels. They are labeled simply "Crash Site" when targeted, and consist of a single, inert Thargoid Scout partially buried at the end of a shallow depression caused by the impact. Scanner analysis of the Scouts indicate they were contaminated with mycoid, indicating they were likely casualties of the First Thargoid War.

## History

In 3302, three Commanders, Mahina Dillon, Otto Granger, and Logan Kohl, experienced an "incident" that led them to a discovery of great importance. On August 27, 3302, the three hacked public GalNet news transmissions and inserted coded text that directed other CMDRs to them. On August 28, 3302, they appeared in the systems Apademak and Cail, and offered to reveal their discovery to the galaxy via a series of clues if they were each given large quantities of certain commodities, marking the beginning of "the Hunt".^[1]^ On August 30, 3302, after Kohl's request for 6 million tons of narcotics was fulfilled and he offered his next clue, CMDRs Noctrach and Ihazevich located the correct planet that the clue hinted at and subsequently discovered the "Alien Crash Site" in a canyon there.^[2]^ Their discovery was noted in a GalNet article posted the following day.^[3]^ The shipwreck was initially called an Unknown Ship, because its origins were a mystery.^[4]^

The wreckage of a smaller ship of vaguely similar design was discovered on September 28, 3303, on the planet HIP 17125 A 3 A in the HIP 17125 system. The circumstances of the discovery were somewhat mysterious, as the original discoverer of the wreckage was never identified.^[5]^ SRV scanner analysis of the wreckage identified it as a Thargoid Scout by comparing it to existing knowledge databases. High concentrations of mycoid particle, the bioweapon used by INRA against the Thargoids during the First Thargoid War in the mid-3100s, were also detected.

On October 14, 3303, an analysis by Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis confirmed suspicions that the first crash site was an ancient Thargoid Interceptor. Tesreau stated, *"Recent analysis of the Thargoid shipwreck in the Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 system indicates that it is a little over 100 years old, despite being extremely similar, if not identical, to the currently active Thargoid Interceptor. This suggests that Thargoid ship design does not change particularly rapidly, and also that the shipwreck in HIP 17125 could be equally old."*^[4]^ Another Crashed Thargoid Ship, the site on planet 3 of the Musca Dark Region PJ-P b6-1 system, predates 3111, as that year was when that particular site was originally discovered by Professor Penelope Carver's survey team. Multiple sites that dated to the Guardian-Thargoid War millions of years ago were discovered in the Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 system.

The first sightings of modern-day crash sites occurred on September 20, 3307, in the aftermath of the activation of a new anti-xeno superweapon created by Salvation in the Cornsar system. The weapon forced the Thargoid fleet attacking Cornsar to flee to hyperspace, after which patrolling pilots and Aegis observation teams confirmed reports of numerous crashed Thargoid Interceptors on several local worlds, the apparent casualties of the weapon.^[6]^^[7]^ More fresh crash sites were created on December 14, 3307, following the activation of three of the anti-xeno superweapons in Delphi, Maia, and Merope.^[8]^

## Notes

- According to Frontier's Michael Brookes, the Crashed Thargoid Ship at Pleiades Sector AB-W B2-4 was the final objective of "the Hunt".^[10]^ No new content related to the aliens was added until the Elite Dangerous: Horizons 2.2 update.^[11]^
