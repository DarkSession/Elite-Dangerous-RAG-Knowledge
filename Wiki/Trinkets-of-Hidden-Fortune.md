**Trinkets of Hidden Fortune** is a very rare commodity that is strictly prohibited in almost every jurisdiction. The commodity is directly linked to The Dark Wheel, a minor faction in Shinrarta Dezhra. The faction gives out missions requiring the player to find the trinkets, increasing the value of each trinket to roughly 100,000 CR. The commodity is incredibly rare so it is suggested to only accept missions for finding it if the player already has some in their inventory.

Trinkets can be pirated from NPC traders, for example, at the Nav Beacon in Plendovii.

Trinkets while rare appear to drop regularly in two systems away from the bubble. Thor's Helmet Sector FB-X C1-5 and Seagull Sector DL-Y D3.
