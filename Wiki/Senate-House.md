# Senate House
**Senate House** is the official meeting place of the Imperial Senate. It is located in the city of Capitol on the planet Capitol in Achenar, and is near the Imperial Palace. Historically, Imperial senators attended sessions of the Senate in-person, but by the 34th century, a senator's physical presence is no longer required for all occasions. Instead, typical sessions within Senate House are held virtually, with many senators attending by remote holographic projection. Physical attendance is still expected as a proper courtesy during certain state events and holidays, such as the accession of a new Emperor and Empire Day.^[1]^
