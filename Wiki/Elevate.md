# Elevate
The Elevate arena with space elevator
 		 	 

**Elevate** is a CQC Championship arena. It features a space elevator that connects the inhabited Earth-like World it orbits to the arena itself. It was the second confirmed arena.^[1]^

## Notes

- Elevate is located in the Theta Ursae Majoris system in the orbit of planet B 1, but cannot be directly accessed outside of a normal CQC match because there is no navigation marker for it.
- This arena is probably the only example in the game (and beyond) demonstrating that space elevators exist in the Elite Universe.

## Trivia

- The elevator structure in Elevate has "Tsiolkovsky Link" printed on it. This is a reference to Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the first person to conceive of the idea of the space elevator.
