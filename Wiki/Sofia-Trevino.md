## Timeline

- 09 JAN 3311. Empire Accused of Power Grab in Federation’s Heart

**Imperials agents have been charged with attempting to seize political influence deep in Federal territory following the Battle of Sol.**

With the aftermath of the Thargoid Invasion still causing upheaval across populated space, there has been a marked effort by many factions to establish themselves in systems impacted by Titan Cocijo’s assault in December.

**Sofia Trevino** wrote a summary for the Federal Times:

“*In recent weeks there has been turmoil in Sol, as political, corporate and military interests come to terms with the impact of Titan Cocijo’s arrival – not to mention the civilian cost, with billions of refugees still displaced in surrounding systems*.”

“*But an unexpected element has emerged, with ports and outposts reporting a significant increase in positive Imperial sentiment. This has been tied to Princess Aisling Duval in particular, currently enjoying a good reputation among non-Imperial populations due to her work as a delegate to Aegis and a champion of humanitarian causes for those impacted by the xeno war*.”

“*Shadow-President Jerome Archer has stamped down on this flourishing popularity and was described as ‘outraged’ by the notion of Imperial influence in the heart of the Federation. Republican media outlets, counteragents and even the Proactive Detection Bureau were deployed to quell the initial unrest*.”

Princess Aisling has denied any involvement in the growth of Imperial support, but did imply that Federal populations ‘*should not be spurned for the consideration of new ideas*’.

It has been noted that a core of Aisling’s supporters remain active in Barnard’s Star, which no doubt concerns the Federal government.^[1]^

- 29 AUG 3310. Jerome Archer and Nakato Kaine Increase Supporters

**Civil, commercial and political groups within the Alliance and Federation are pledging loyalty to two increasingly high-profile individuals.**

**Sofia Trevino** published a summary for The Federal Times:

“*President Zachary Hudson has long been the figurehead for a wide range of Federal communities and corporations. But as he prepares to depart the White House, many of these are transferring their allegiance to the new head of the Republican Party, Vice President Jerome Archer*.”

“*When Felicia Winters becomes president, Archer will take on the role of shadow president and lead the Republican opposition to the governing Liberal Party. He will effectively inherit Hudson’s political power base, which spreads across the Federation and through many independent systems. Many millions of people, including members of the Pilots’ Federation, will perform tasks and exploit local resources in order to expand Archer’s influence*.”

In the Alliance, a similar situation is now being recognised, as discussed by Vanya Driscoll of The Alliance Tribune:

“*Councillor Nakato Kaine is the representative for the Tionisla system and has been a vocal presence in the Assembly for several years. She ran against Prime Minister Edmund Mahon in the 3307 elections, gaining many followers despite being ultimately unsuccessful. Kaine has also directly opposed many of Mahon’s policies, particularly the strategic defence pact with Sirius Corporation, on the grounds that the Alliance’s founding principles should not bend to megacorporate influence*.”

“*This has led Kaine to become a rallying point for those who wish to see Allied systems governed more like the Old Worlds. She is a proponent of electoral reform that would allow the public to directly choose their leaders, rather than the Assembly voting on their behalf. Many local businesses, organisations and political bodies have been attracted by Kaine’s ambitions to transform the Alliance*.”^[2]^

- 13 FEB 3310. Catastrophic Earthquakes Strike Rhea 3

**A series of high-magnitude earthquakes on the planet Rhea 3 have caused widespread devastation and millions of casualties**.

Massive seismic activity across the northern continent has effectively shattered dozens of towns and cities, including the capital New Greenacre. The intense tremors also triggered tsunamis in the surrounding oceans, which have wrecked coastal regions on other land masses.

Local journalist Len Kennelly published a summary for Vox Galactica:

“*The only disaster on this scale that we’ve seen in Rhea was when NMLA terrorists bombed Ito Orbital. This time, however, the death toll could run into tens of millions. Urban skylines have crumbled like sandcastles, with vast jagged pits opening up to swallow entire neighbourhoods*.”

“*Federal Liberal Command has declared the highest state of emergency, calling for volunteers to help rescue trapped citizens. We’re seeing direct support from other factions in the system, and Federal Navy specialists are coordinating relief efforts. The humanitarian organisation Safeguard Interstellar is also here in force, providing supplies and temporary shelters for survivors*.”

**Sofia Trevino**, political correspondent for The Federal Times, reported:

“*As soon as this news broke, President-elect Felicia Winters – a native of Rhea 3 and the system’s representative in Congress – immediately cancelled her schedule and travelled to her homeworld. Unverified reports claim that contact has been lost with members of her family, most of whom lived in the capital*.”

“*Speculation has already begun that this might cause further delays to the beginning of Winters’s term of office. Vice President-elect Isolde Rochester made a statement asking for patience, claiming: ‘Our focus right now should be on aiding those affected by this tragedy.’*”^[3]^

- 22 JAN 3310. Winters Appoints Future Cabinet Members

**President-elect Felicia Winters has officially selected new heads for each executive department of the Federal government**.

She announced her choices during a session of Congress, where she gave a short speech about her upcoming presidency. This was followed by a similar statement from Isolde Rochester, who will serve as Winters’s vice president.

**Sofia Trevino**, political journalist for The Federal Times, reported:

“*With these appointments, Felicia Winters is laying the foundations on which to build a new Federal government. Long-serving figures in the Liberal Party are finally being rewarded with key positions in the upcoming administration*.”

“*One notable loyalist is Congressman Bai Zheng, who will be Secretary for Security. She is already well-known for opposing the Proactive Detection Bureau, and will undoubtedly take pleasure in overseeing the surveillance unit’s closure, as per Winters’s campaign promise*.”

“*Congressman Kristine Lasky is another familiar name. Her celebrated role in creating the Cornelius-Lasky Convention, which enables superpowers to collaborate during emergencies, makes her a solid choice for Secretary of State*.”

“*There are a few fresher faces among the forthcoming Cabinet. The new Grand Attorney will be Pierre-Marc Pelletier, a former director of the Federal Attorney’s Office. And the Secretary for Defence will be Congressman Conn Montgomery, who will have to navigate demands from a Federal Navy accustomed to Zachary Hudson’s generous military budgets*.”

In related news, planning is underway for Felicia Winters’s inauguration ceremony to take place in mid-February. President Hudson’s office has confirmed that handover procedures are well advanced, with all government agencies and departments preparing for the Federation’s new leadership.^[4]^

- 12 OCT 3309. Sol Celebrations End as Election Begins

**\*Pilots’ Federation ALERT\***

The Federation has begun voting to decide its next president, as a week of festivities in the Sol system are concluded.

Congress confirmed that any pilots who supplied rare goods for the celebratory events can collect payment from Li Qing Jao starport. All temporary system permits for Sol remain suspended for Pilots’ Federation members for a further week.

The 3309 presidential election has now officially begun. More than one trillion Federal citizens are expected to submit their votes, which will be recorded and collated over the next four days via secure digital systems.

Vice President Jerome Archer is the Republican Party candidate, who is widely perceived as the political heir to President Zachary Hudson. His running mate is Congressman Niko Shirakawa, who has strong connections within the military.

Shadow President Felicia Winters, leader of the Liberal Party, is the rival candidate and a proponent of more humanitarian-focused policies. She is on a presidential ticket with Congressman Isolde Rochester, matriarch of the famous Rochester dynasty.

**Sofia Trevino**, political correspondent for The Federal Times, commented:

“Following months of delay, logistical issues caused by the Thargoid war, plus the drama surrounding Zachary Rackham, voting is finally underway. Analysts believe this could be one of the closest-run elections in the Federation’s history, reflecting the polarisation that has taken place in recent years.”

“Support for the Republican Party has been bolstered by its increasingly successful handling of the Thargoid menace during the past six months. But Archer’s flagship creation, the Proactive Detection Bureau, remains highly divisive – something the Liberal Party has found success in using to frame its opponent as increasingly authoritarian. How these primary points will ultimately impact the outcome of the vote remains to be seen.”

The new president will be announced on Monday 16th October. President Hudson will remain in office as caretaker president until the official inauguration of the election winner, expected to take place in the new year.^[5]^

- 12 JUN 3309. Far God Deportation Programme Approved

**The Federation has agreed to the expulsion of all adherents of the Order of the Far God to the Alliance.**

President Zachary Hudson issued a statement alongside the government decision:

“Any ideology that worships the Thargoids is destructive and treasonous, especially now we are at war with that species. I believe that rather than waste taxpayers’ money keeping these deluded individuals incarcerated, the Federation is better off without them.”

“This morning I accepted Prime Minister Mahon’s proposal. All former citizens known to have pledged themselves to this toxic religion will be transported beyond our borders and into the care of the Alliance.”

Security services have prioritised the True Chapters cultists currently imprisoned in the Popontia system, labelling them as high-risk compared to orthodox Far God followers. They will be escorted to Alliance space aboard the Dedicant, having agreed to provide full access to the megaship’s databanks and the Order’s sacred texts for Federal assessment. The Dedicant will then collect cultists held in other Federal penal facilities, ferrying them to Allied systems.

Political correspondent **Sofia Trevino** wrote an opinion piece for The Federal Times:

“Could there be an ulterior motive to this unexpected decision by the President? Perhaps Hudson is mindful of his legacy, with his term of office approaching its end. By tempering his ‘strong man’ reputation with a degree of leniency, he can better portray himself as a firm but fair leader in the Federation’s history books.”^[6]^

- 22 MAY 3309. Presidential Campaigns Target Federal Voters

Jerome Archer, Felicia Winters and Zachary Rackham are lobbying for public support as the Federation prepares to elect a new president in August.

Political correspondent **Sofia Trevino** covered the race for The Federal Times:

“*With Zachary Hudson’s eight-year term approaching its end, citizens must decide who will be the president of the Federation by the year’s end. The electoral machines for all three candidates are in full swing, with campaign slogans appearing at all Federal starports.*”

“*The Republican Party has pinned its hopes on current Vice President Jerome Archer, who hopes to reassure Hudson loyalists with his similar leadership style and focus on interstellar security. Shadow President Felicia Winters, head of the Liberal Party, is promising a more humanitarian approach to government policy. And the wild card is independent candidate Zachary Rackham, whose wealth and notoriety afford him a fighting chance against the political heavyweights.*”

“*Congress has confirmed that, with many government procedures impacted by the Thargoid war, election day has been delayed until later in the year. President Hudson is expected to remain in office for the interim period before the victor's official inauguration.*”

Vox Galactica reporter Patricia Chen analysed the media coverage:

“*Typically, Federal newsfeeds focus more on character than policies. The Federal Free Press obtained in-depth interviews with Winters and Isolde Rochester, while Sol Today published souvenir editions celebrating Hudson’s presidency as a ‘golden age’. On the fringes are those such as ICE-caster Sura Oyekan, who promotes voting for Rackham as a way to revolutionise society.*”

“*What is not typical is that this election is being held during wartime. The ongoing Thargoid conflict has cast a shadow over voters’ optimism for the future. Some are even wondering if this might be the last president they ever elect, should the alien invasion of the core systems prove unstoppable.*”^[7]^

- 01 MAY 3309. Rackham Fundraiser Secures Political Backing

Independent presidential candidate Zachary Rackham held a gala ball for some of the Federation’s wealthy and influential elite.

The Federal Times published a report from political correspondent **Sofia Trevino**:

“*The extravagant gathering at Fort Rackham (formerly Fort Falkenrath) on Taylor Colony felt more like a party than a fundraiser, but its ambitions were clear. Campaign finance laws forbid Zachary Rackham from using his own wealth to pay for his presidential bid, and so connections are being forged to entice donations and other types of support.*”

“*Mr Rackham’s campaign manager – and the originator of his ‘Just Like Me’ slogan – was revealed to be celebrity PR consultant Anya Blackriver. She organised many famous attendees including media barons Elias Metaxas and Neive McFarlane, the youthful but popular ICE-caster Sura Oyekan, and flamboyant business magnate ‘Sir’ Randolph Plaskett of the Knights of Enterprise.*”

“*The biggest surprise was the announcement that Congressman Harlan Turk, the highly respected representative for the Duamta system, has resigned from the Republican Party to serve as Mr Rackham’s running mate. Four independent congressmen also declared that they are joining his campaign, giving the entrepreneur some genuine political clout.*”

The newsfeed Sol Today published a related editorial:

“*President Hudson has served with honour, and deserves our respect for keeping citizens safe in recent years. But perhaps it’s time for some fresh blood at the Federation’s heart? Could Zachary Rackham’s infallible business instincts be what’s needed to boost our economy to new heights of prosperity?*”^[8]^

- 15 FEB 3308. Federation Divided by Hudson's Proposal

- President Zachary Hudson's intention to remove the limit on his term in office has caused a deep rift among congressmen and voters alike. Political correspondent Sofia Trevino analysed the situation in The Federal Times: "Ever since the 77th amendment to the Federal Accord was ratified in 2594, no president has remained in office for longer than eight years. This is why the Hudson Contravention, as Congress officially refers to it, has turned up the heat on the simmering political division within the Federation. Members of the Cabinet and other leading Republicans have argued passionately that only Zachary Hudson has the experience and fortitude to guide the Federation through this eventful period in history. His supporters point to successes such as curtailing the secession crisis, ending the NMLA threat and introducing greater security via the Proactive Detection Bureau. However, others insist that repealing this amendment could pave the way from democracy to dictatorship. Two former presidents – Antonia Madison and Jasmina Halsey – have publicly condemned the Hudson Contravention as unconstitutional and dangerous. There are expectations that Shadow President Felicia Winters will move for a vote of no confidence. Political analysts suspect that after several controversial leadership decisions from Hudson last year, he would be unlikely to win over a majority in Congress."^[9]^

- 03 NOV 3307. Demands for Federal Rebellion Decline

- Many factions have seceded from the Federation in recent months, but recent polls suggest the likelihood of further withdrawals is waning. The Federal Times published an update on the situation by political correspondent Sofia Trevino: "Some negative reaction to the Proactive Detection Bureau was anticipated. But it's unlikely that Congress foresaw nearly forty systems abandoning the Federal Accord, as their governing factions declared independence. Fears that this would spiral into mass rebellion now seem misplaced, however. This is partly thanks to the PDB's recent role in preventing Jupiter's Wrath from committing terrorist acts. Although that group is hardly in the NMLA's league, evidence that communications surveillance can save lives seems to have convinced some Federal citizens to reconsider their opposition. President Hudson's efforts against the breakaway factions were hailed by his supporters and decried by his opponents. But the Federal Diplomatic Corps remain displeased that Hudson suffered no repercussions for violating diplomatic immunity when attempting to capture Yuri Grom. Shadow President Winters continues to call for the PDB to be shut down to prevent the Federation from becoming an authoritarian police state. But many accuse her rhetoric on civil liberties to have triggered the secessions in the first place. Meanwhile, many Federal factions are carefully observing those who did become independent. Their future success or failure may well determine whether or not this rebellion continues."^[10]^

- 13 SEP 3307. Rebellion Spreads Through the Federation

- A further seven Federal factions have severed ties with the superpower in protest against government monitoring of communications. These latest secessions have been undertaken by minor factions that do not control any systems, including Unktock Free, United Posenoi League and Progressive Party of Inggale. Political journalist Sofia Trevino reported for The Federal Times: "Eight factions had previously declared independence from the Federation, and now an even greater number forms the third wave of rebellion. It's clear that their populations feel empowered to take a stand against losing their constitutional rights of privacy. Vice President Archer shrugged off this latest development, maintaining that 'the Proactive Detection Bureau performs a vital security role in these troubled times'. Since none of these latest factions currently govern a system, he may also believe that resistance to the PDB is on the wane. Although these events have only impacted a small part of Federal territory, they remain an embarrassment for President Hudson's administration. Shadow President Winters continues to implore Congress to repeal the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, but she has also taken political criticism since many feel her rhetoric inspired these factions to secede."^[11]^

- 21 JUL 3307. Federation Threatened by Further Secession

- More Federal factions are considering declaring independence following the recent conflict in the Azaladshu system. Sofia Trevino, political journalist with The Federal Times, published an overview of the situation: "When Azaladshu Free seceded in reaction to the government's surveillance laws, it inspired three other factions to do the same, making ten systems and a billion people independent. Superpowers routinely gain and lose systems via local politics, but this was a rare instance of member factions abandoning their fealty. The newly sovereign nations have severed all links with the Proactive Detection Bureau, so their communications are no longer being monitored. Despite broad public support for the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, many citizens still consider personal privacy to be a constitutional right. Dozens of other factions are now considering independence. This affects only a small percentage of the systems under Federal control, but is highly embarrassing for President Hudson as well as Shadow President Winters – her organised resistance to the surveillance laws is what inspired factions to secede. Advocacy, the civil rights organisation, claims that the Federal Intelligence Agency has begun arresting secessionist ringleaders under spurious charges. If true, it suggests that the government will go to any lengths to prevent a full-scale rebellion spreading throughout the Federation."^[12]^

- 22 FEB 3307. Hudson and Winters Confirmed for Galactic Summit

- President Zachary Hudson and Shadow President Felicia Winters will both attend the diplomatic conference in the Sirius system. The Federation will also be represented by ambassadors from the Federal Diplomatic Corps, as well as several civil and corporate interests. Political correspondent Sofia Trevino reported for The Federal Times: "President Hudson's personal presence at the Galactic Summit sends the message that he still holds the reins of power. He clearly hopes that facing off against the Empire's leaders will distract the public from the recent Jupiter Rochester scandals. In his absence, Vice President Brad Mitchell will oversee congressional matters. There are rumours that Mitchell is positioning himself to challenge Hudson as the Republican Party candidate in the next election. The conference also offers opportunities for Felicia Winters to appear presidential. She has eagerly agreed to meet the Marlinist Colonies delegation, having coordinated humanitarian aid for the refugees last year. Winters has not asked Shadow VP Isolde Rochester to accompany her, perhaps as a rebuke for the criminal actions of her son. Furiously working on damage control for her family's name, the Rochester matriarch has taken Jupiter's two children into her care after his husband, Tomas Turai, filed for immediate divorce."^[13]^
