**Multi-Weave** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to Shield Generators through Engineering. It increases shield resistances at the cost of higher power consumption and distributor draw.

## Effects

| Statistic | Change | Effect +ve/-ve |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Distributor Draw | +25% | - |
| Kinetic Resistance | +1.73% | + |
| Thermal Resistance | +3.46% | + |
| Explosive Resistance | +1.44% | + |
| Power Draw | +10% | - |

## Applicability

The effect is available for the following modules:

- Shield Generators:
    - Standard Shield Generator
    - Prismatic Shield Generator
    - Bi-Weave Shield Generator

## Required Materials

- 5x Worn Shield Emitters
- 3x Flawed Focus Crystals
- 1x Aberrant Shield Pattern Analysis
