> LP 98-132 is an anarchic system with a solitary small M2V type dim red star. There isn't a lot here, though there is some mining of valuable minerals like cobalt, rutile and coltan, and very occasionally of gold. Piracy is rife here with pirates on the lookout for those high value cargos. There is a station called Freeport operated by a group of locals, and this is the nearest thing to law that exists in the system.

**LP 98-132** is an Allied system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. Although it has little to offer in the 34th century, its history since its discovery was dominated by conflict between petty warlords and anarchy, the result of competition over the system's mineral reserves.
