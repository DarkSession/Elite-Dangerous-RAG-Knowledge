## Description

After the so-called Thargoid Maelstroms arrived in the central systems of the Bubble, the leading factions of the Russian-speaking segment, led by the Close Encounters Corps, established an administrative ideological structure aimed at the collective coordination and possible defense of systems throughout the Russian-speaking sector, as well as the proclamation of the need to join forces to repel the threat to the collective humanity.

Immediately after its creation, representatives of the AOCC decided to inform all independent factions that they had chosen an effective option to counter a threat never before seen in mankind - an adapted principle of the so-called "triage" (from French "triage, sorting - distribution of victims and patients into groups based on urgency and homogeneity of necessary measures in a particular situation").

In other words, the following principle of joint work was outlined:

- Coalition of Allied Factions member factions should analyze their holdings, identify systems affected by the invasion, monitor them and update them;
- Coalition of Allied Factions member factions must rank affected systems in three degrees of priority, giving preference to systems with large populations, space and ground ports, and systems of strategic importance. The ranking occurs according to modified principles of so-called triage, viz: "urgent", "emergency", and "non-urgent", conventionally referred to as "morgue".
- The factions participating in the Coalition of Allied Factions, based on the ranking of the systems affected by the invasion, should narrow down the range of necessary works to the "urgent" and ""emergency" systems, deliberately rejecting the systems falling into the "non-urgent" level, since their maintenance is fraught with a strong dispersion of forces and resources, and a loss of precious time and effort.

According to the AOCC, such a simplified scheme and deliberate abandonment of non-critical or pre-destroyed systems will allow the segment factions to save the basic resources, nerves and strength of the regular pilots, and allow them to cover more territory for operational activities.

An operationally formed working group successfully gathered and analyzed incoming Thargoid information, created a ranking of systems for defense, and selected possible equipment kits for the pilots' ships. The result of the first weeks of work of the AOCC, with the support of independent pilots of the segment, was the successful defense of a number of systems, which proved the validity of the cooperative approach to the protection of the segment.

Currently the unit is expanding its staff, hiring independent pilots and trying to build a solid foundation to counter the Thargoid threat, gathering statistical and tactical information and developing specialized software in the process.  The movement sometimes spontaneously involves factions of the Russian-speaking segment, other such associations, members of the Coalition of Allied Factions and independent pilots.
