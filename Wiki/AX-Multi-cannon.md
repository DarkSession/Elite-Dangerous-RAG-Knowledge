The **AX Multi-cannon** is a multi-cannon created by Aegis. Released on October 5, 3303, the AX Multi-cannon is capable of damaging Thargoid Interceptors when used in conjunction with AX Missile Racks to expose Thargoid Hearts. Class 2 versions can be purchased at military, high-tech, industrial, and refinery planetary bases, while Class 3 versions can be purchased only at military planetary bases. 

The AX Multi-cannon is designed primarily for combat against Thargoid ships, and consequently deals less damage against conventional human ships than a standard Multi-cannon.
