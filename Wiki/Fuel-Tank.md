## Notes

- All ships come standard with the biggest fuel tank they can fit.
- Fuel Tanks can be downgraded to increase jump range, but it is not recommended. Since tanks have 0 mass, only the mass of the fuel is considered. Keeping your tank half full will give the same effect of having a full tank of half of your current size, while still giving you the flexibility to fill your tank for longer trips.
