**Faulcon DeLacy** (most of the time **Faulcon deLacy**) is an independent manufacturer of ships and equipment based in Reorte. It specializes in producing multipurpose and combat-oriented ships known for their ruggedness and reliability. The company was founded in the 28th century as Faulcon Manspace and made its name with the original Viper before rapidly expanding through a number of acquisitions including deLacy ShipWorks and Zorgon Peterson. By the 34th century, the company has become the largest of all ship manufacturers, as well as one of the most widespread and consistently admired corporations in the galaxy. Public regard for Faulcon deLacy is so high that the Alliance, Empire, and Federation have all attempted to secure exclusivity contracts, but without success.^[1]^

## History

Faulcon deLacy is one of the most famous names in the history of interstellar exploration. The corporation began life as a much smaller organisation: Faulcon Manspace, a military supply organisation based in Reorte. It rose to prominence when it developed a fighter craft which was christened the Viper.^[2]^ The Viper's sales exceeded all expectations, enough so that Faulcon Manspace was forced to license production to other companies just to meet demand.^[1]^

As the company prospered, it introduced new innovations and sought to tap into other markets with ship designs named after dangerous snakes, such as the Cobra Mk I for traders and the Sidewinder Mk I for light reconnaissance duties. Faulcon Manspace merged with deLacy ShipWorks in 2982, one of the largest shipyards building Faulcon ships under license.^[1]^ One of the first new products from the merged company was the troubled Cobra Mk II which released in 3034. This was an upgraded version of the now very dated Cobra Mk I, but was not especially successful and was soon withdrawn. Despite this, the new company grew into a corporate behemoth, and went from strength to strength, launching the Cobra Mk III to great acclaim in 3100.^[2]^

In 3300, Faulcon deLacy stands as the largest independent ship manufacturer in colonised space. The interstellar powers recognise the quality of the work done by the corporation and often recognise this above any concerns over retaining technological exclusivity. It has both grown organically, and by acquisition, swallowing a great many of its smaller competitors and client yards over the years.^[3]^

Faulcon deLacy is a major corporation, with shipyards dotted around human space, and many more sales offices. It has a wide range of ships available for sale, and an extremely long heritage from its progenitor companies going back over half a millennium. It has manufactured more than a million ships over that period, and a great many are still in use. It sells into all markets, though is widely known and has the highest sales in the vast number of independent systems.^[3]^

Faulcon deLacy manufactures many of the smaller components in its own ships, and has a well established relationship with the Sirius Corporation, for its hyperdrives and power plants. It is also a big customer of the WCM Corporation - buying its hull alloys from them as raw material.^[4]^

It still operates a modular system for the construction, which operates throughout their range of products, and all ships are built to a standardised grid system. It has also innovated too - allowing its competitors to use the same system - which has benefitted Faulcon deLacy greatly, and ironically makes acquisition a straightforward process.^[4]^
