# List of Rare Commodities
**Rare Commodities** are unique Commodities that are exclusive to specific markets and only available in limited amounts. Unlike normal Commodities, they always rise in value the further away they are sold from their origin station, with their price peaking at 200 ly away. The availability or allocation of a specific Rare Commodity can fluctuate depending on the state of the minor faction that sells it, and in the event the minor faction loses control of the station, its associated Rare Commodity will be unavailable for purchase until the minor faction regains control.

The quantity available is limited to a base quantity modified by the system state such as boom, and if the player's ship has that many or more of the commodity in its cargo hold then they cannot buy more. They will be unable to buy more until ten minutes has expired since they were last in the station with the rare goods.

## Notes

- According to Michael Brooks, "Rare goods are intended to be a low volume, high yield good that needs to be transported over a distance. For small ships you can fill the hold with a few tons and make speed run. For larger ships you supplement normal trade goods with rare items or do large loops, picking up small quantities along the way but carrying a variety. No more than your quota for each rare will be generated."
- Some rare goods may become unavailable if changes to controlling factions make the rare good illegal. This may appear that a particular good has been removed from the game, when in actuality, the rare good is still in the game code, it is just not for sale or listed until it becomes legal to be sold at the station/outpost/starport it originates from.
- The state of the factions in a system can now affect the allocation total of rare goods. Conflict states (War, Civil War, Election) will reduce production. Other states may also lower production: Bust, Civil Unrest, Lockdown, Outbreak, Expansion, and Retreat. Boom temporarily increases production.
