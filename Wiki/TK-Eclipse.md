## Overview

Though the TK Eclipse lacks the range and DPS of the TK Aphelion, its higher rate of fire, magazine size, reserve ammo capacity, and short range accuracy make it a very effective shield-stripping weapon. 

Unlike most other primary weapons, the Eclipse does not incur a movement speed penalty when held—this trait is especially useful when wearing the Maverick or Artemis suits, which lack heavy armor and must rely more on dodging fire than taking it.

As a thermal weapon, the Eclipse is more effective at dealing damage to shields.
