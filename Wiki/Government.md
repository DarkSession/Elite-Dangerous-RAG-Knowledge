**Government** in *Elite Dangerous* primarily refers to organisational structure and characteristics of a Minor Faction. The Government of a Minor Faction determines which commander activities will increase or decrease its influence and the level of contentment of the people inhabiting star systems and assets under its control, which in turn impacts the Background Simulation. Government types also affect the availability and quality of certain dock services.

## Government Types

### Standard

There are 11 standard government types:

| Government | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Anarchy | Anarchist factions are typically criminal gangs or organisations that possess no official (or organised) form of government, yet still wield influence within a system. They usually have no formal laws, except those of self-preservation and personal loyalty to an individual, and as such anarchy systems are lawless and dangerous places. Ships from Anarchist factions in systems controlled by a non-Anarchist faction are usually wanted, making them prime targets for bounty hunters. |
| --- | --- |
| Communist | Communist governments believe in an equal society, although one controlled by a central group. The means to choose that central group are varied, and often contradict the altruistic aims of such a society. Generally such governments are totalitarian and centralised. |
| --- | --- |
| Confederacy | Confederacy factions are sometimes considered forms of proto-democracy. Although instead of a centrally elected government their society is governed by smaller parties and interest groups working in concert. The votes of the individual are not a core concept for these societies, although can be found in some. |
| --- | --- |
| Cooperative | Cooperative factions are similar to communist ones in that their core precept is equal stature of all members of society. Unlike communist factions, a cooperative's governance is not centralised, but organised through devolved parties and committees. All are expected to work equally for the betterment of their society, rather than that of the individual. |
| --- | --- |
| Corporate | Corporate State governments extend the corporate structure throughout the society, with shareholding being the equivalent to citizenship. The principles will vary, but are generally set to ensure smooth operations for the corporations, often to the benefit of the attached population. |
| --- | --- |
| Democracy | Democratic governments are chosen by the voting public. The government then sets the law. While the specifics often vary between democratic states, they are all unified by the concept of being accountable to their voters. |
| --- | --- |
| Dictatorship | Dictatorships have an overall ruler, who will remain leader until they die, or are overthrown. Power in the society is controlled (often by extreme measures) by that single individual. Succession is often a tumultuous affair. All members of society owe their allegiance to that individual. |
| --- | --- |
| Feudal | Feudal societies are based around a group of feudal leaders, each of which have absolute power within their region. They usually cooperate to appoint a single overall representative, but power rests with the feudal lords, rather than the appointed representative. |
| --- | --- |
| Patronage | Factions and societies based upon Patronage have at their root a family structure, with a hierarchy extended beyond that. Loyalty and honour is generally at its centre, similar to that of the Empire. Some argue this provides a truer form of democracy. |
| --- | --- |
| Prison Colony | Prison colony factions deal with the governance of prisoner inmate populations, usually on a large scale. While they are authoritarian and often controlled at the top end by a law enforcement element, they do sometimes contain a political element contributed by the prisoners. |
| --- | --- |
| Theocracy | Theocratic factions are based upon the structures of their respective religions. The practical processes are different between the religions, but they all share the concept that their society exists in devotion to their religion and the deity or deities or beliefs at their centre. |
| --- | --- |

### Unique

There are 4 special government types that apply to specific situations:

- Engineer - Formerly "Workshop". The government type used for Engineer Workshops.
- None - The government type for all uninhabited systems. Functionally similar to Anarchy in that there will be no security response to criminal actions.
- Prison - The government type for the four factions (Alliance Incarceration Concern, Federal Internment Corporation, Imperial Detainment Company, Independent Detention Foundation) that control Detention Centres.
- Private Ownership - The government type for all Fleet Carriers.

### Deprecated

There are 2 government types which are not utilised:

- Colony - Originally used for factions in newly-colonised systems, which would later mature into a pre-determined standard government type.
- Imperial - While present in the game, no minor faction with this government type has ever been documented.

## Government Subtypes

Most government types have multiple subtypes depending on a minor faction's allegiance which are described on the Status submenu of the System Status tab in the right panel of the ship HUD. Note that certain government types are not permitted under the laws of the Federation, Empire, and Alliance, and so no minor factions exist with the subtypes for certain allegiance and government combinations.

## Special Descriptions

Some minor factions have special government subtype descriptions. These minor factions behave identically to generic minor factions with the same government subtype, but the special descriptions usually reference a past event in the game, such as a Community Goal, in which the factions were involved.
