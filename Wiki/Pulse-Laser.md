The **Pulse Laser** is an energy weapon that emits intermittent laser blasts while being fired. Compared to other energy weapons, Pulse Lasers are relatively weak, but they are cheap, and their low power consumption and heat generation allows them to be fired more frequently. All newly-purchased ships, regardless of size or manufacturer, always come equipped with up to two Pulse Lasers by default.

## Usage

The Pulse Laser inflicts thermal damage, making it very effective against shields and less effective against armour. Its maximum range is 3000m but Damage Falloff begins at just 500m. Pulse Lasers can deliver a significant amount of damage in a single hit. Unlike other laser weapons that fire continuously when triggered, a Pulse Laser fires intermittently. Compared to the other two laser types it emits the least waste heat, draws the least distributor energy, and is also the cheapest type of weapon, but these advantages come at the expense of firepower.

A variant of the Pulse Laser, the Pulse Disruptor, is available as a Powerplay loyalty reward.
