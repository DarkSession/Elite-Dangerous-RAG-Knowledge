# Jurisdiction
## System Jurisdiction

The jurisdiction in a system is determined by the systems controlling faction. This extends to all areas outside of the local space around a station, or outpost.

## Station Jurisdiction

The jurisdiction of non-supercruise space around a station or outpost is that of the station or outposts controlling faction. This means that if you are wanted by the controlling faction of a system, you may find that you are not wanted when at the station of another minor faction, even in the same system.
