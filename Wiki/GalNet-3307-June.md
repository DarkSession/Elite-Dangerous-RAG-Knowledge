### Aegis Megaship Prepares to Escape Thargoids

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

All independent ships aboard the Alexandria in the HIP 16538 system will be undocked on Thursday the 3rd of June.

The megaship triggered an invasion of Thargoid vessels when it arrived from the Delphi system. Aegis believes this was a reaction to the large quantities of Guardian artefacts being stored in its cargo holds.

Captain Jacob Morales, commanding officer of the Alexandria, outlined the next steps:

“On Thursday we will make a hyperspace jump to the HIP 30944 system. Since this has a small population, the risk of casualties will be low if the Thargoids continue to pursue us. Once there, we will arrange to offload our cargo and distribute it to multiple locations.”

“As a precaution, shortly before the jump we will uncouple all independent ships and leave them in the HIP 16538 system. We advise all pilots currently docked with the Alexandria to depart as soon as possible.”

The Alexandria was ordered not to enter any Federal systems, causing many newsfeeds to refer to it as a ‘plague ship’. There are widespread concerns that it will attract Thargoids to any system it travels to.

### Jupiter Division Inspires Corporatist Movement

The Core Dynamics breakaway faction created by ex-CEO Jupiter Rochester has survived, by gathering believers in the corporate rule of the Federation.

Conrad Sterling, political journalist for Vox Galactica, published this report:

“With its military forces defeated in February, and its leader found guilty of mass murder and imprisoned for life, Jupiter Division should now be a footnote in the Federation’s history.”

“Yet in recent months it has steadily grown, retaking control of HIP 54530 and several neighbouring systems. Its megaship, Victory’s Forge, even managed to repel Federal troops and remains under Jupiter Division’s command.”

“There is much speculation about the underlying reasons for this. Alongside general unrest with the Federation’s current policies, there is a rising interest in Rochester’s grand vision – replacing democracy with corporatocracy – among those wishing to see change. Many have flocked to Jupiter Division’s banner, preventing its collapse.”

“Core Dynamics, its parent company, has also continued to see defections within its ranks. However, new CEO Owen McKenna has vowed to destroy his predecessor’s rogue department. It is possible that Jupiter Division’s survival was only a brief reprieve, unless the corporatists can gather in sufficient numbers to sustain it.”

## 03 JUN

### Tritium Mining Campaign Boosts Alliance Expansion

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Prime Minister Edmund Mahon’s request for mined tritium has concluded, paving the way for new Alliance starports.

Large quantities of tritium were delivered, which will provide fuel for a civil infrastructure programme designed to increase the Alliance’s presence.

As part of this expansion, new Alliance starports will be constructed in these systems by the 25th of June 3307:

LHS 2522

Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19

Prime Minister Mahon, who was recently re-elected by the Assembly, told the media:

“The economy of the Alliance will benefit greatly from investment in expansion. These new stations will provide more opportunities for individuals and corporations alike.”

Pilots who mined and delivered tritium can now collect their rewards from Dublin Citadel in the Gateway system.

### Core Dynamics Engages Jupiter Division in Battle

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The corporate faction Jupiter Division is fighting for survival against the Silver Legal Group in the Ts'ao Tach system.

Jupiter Division was formed by rogue Core Dynamics departments loyal to ex-CEO Jupiter Rochester. Although it was defeated in February, a growing corporatist movement within the Federation has helped rebuild its strength.

A call to arms was made by Owen McKenna, the new CEO of Core Dynamics:

“Rochester’s deranged cult must be wiped out once and for all. We are supporting our ally, the Silver Legal Group, to destroy Jupiter Division’s fleet and allow us to retake our stolen resources.”

Vice-Executive Blanca Carbonell, a senior leader of Jupiter Division, broadcast this message:

“To all those seeking a better Federation – stand up and make your voice heard! Only direct corporate rule can end government corruption. Jupiter Division must survive to lead that change!”

Two megaships, Victory’s Forge and Iron Wings of Justice, are once again serving as the centres of operation for Jupiter Division and the Silver Legal Group.

Political commentators believe that this second conflict will be a decisive one, determining whether or not Jupiter Division can survive without its founder.

## 04 JUN

### Aegis Megaship Vanishes in Hyperspace

The Alexandria has failed to arrive in the HIP 30944 system as scheduled, and may have been hyperdicted by the Thargoids.

The Aegis-owned megaship triggered an attack by Thargoid vessels when it travelled from the Delphi system to HIP 16538 on the 20th of May. Aegis believes this was caused by the large quantity of Guardian artefacts in its cargo holds.

To reduce the risk of further casualties, the Alexandria plotted a route to a low-population prison colony in the HIP 30944 system. All independent ships were undocked before it made the hyperspace jump on the 3rd of June.

However, the megaship never reached its arrival point and all communication with it has ceased. Search teams in local systems have not detected its presence.

Admiral Aden Tanner, chief military liaison with Aegis, informed the media:

“We regret to announce a complete loss of contact with the Alexandria. Although there is no evidence of damage or destruction, its disappearance while travelling through hyperspace raises the possibility that it was intercepted en route by Thargoid forces.”

“Captain Jacob Morales and over four thousand crewmembers will be listed as missing presumed dead. In addition to this great tragedy, Aegis’s research programme into Guardian technology has been severely impacted by the loss of many precious artefacts.”

## 07 JUN

### Neo-Marlinist Political Party Emerges

Minister Aaron Whyte, leader of the Marlinism Reformation Party, has confirmed that it aims to politically represent the Neo-Marlinist fringe.

At a meeting of the Marlinist Parliament, Minister Whyte declared:

“Not all of the Neo-Marlinist community seek a violent uprising to end the Duval family’s thousand-year dictatorship. We can help replace desperate acts of rebellion with meaningful dialogue and public pressure.”

Several newsfeeds observed that Whyte was attempting to rebrand Neo-Marlinism as being closer to the mainstream ideals of Marlinism. However, the possibility that the faction may now act as the political wing of the NMLA has caused widespread alarm.

In related news, a recent election in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system saw voters remove the Marlinism Reformation Party from power, after it granted asylum to survivors from the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid.

The system’s new leader, Minister Octavia Volkov of the Exiled Marlinist Assembly of Baltah'Sine, announced:

“My party believes in following Marlin Duval’s example by building independent democracies, rather than reforming the Empire. However, three of our colony systems have already fallen under the control of foreign factions. We urgently need support to keep the dream of a Marlinist Republic alive.”

## 10 JUN

### Core Dynamics Triumphs Against Jupiter Division

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The corporate faction Jupiter Division has been defeated by the Silver Legal Group in the Ts'ao Tach system.

The breakaway faction from Core Dynamics was unable to resist efforts by its parent company to recover ships and resources. Jupiter Division will soon be subsumed by Core Enterprises, a subsidiary of Core Dynamics.

Owen McKenna, the CEO of Core Dynamics, declared:

“Thanks to the Silver Legal Group and other loyal allies of the Federation, we have finally crushed this criminal enterprise. Let this be an end to the delusions of Jupiter Rochester.”

Many newsfeeds believe that Jupiter Division’s defeat will have a negative impact on the corporatist movement that has recently emerged within some Federal systems.

Director Theodore Sullivan of the Silver Legal Group confirmed that those who fought on their side can now collect payments from the Iron Wings of Justice megaship in the Ts'ao Tach system.

### The Legacy of the Hesperus

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Commanders in the Chukchan and Perseus Dark Region KC-V c2-2 systems have reported being contacted by ‘Salvation’.

The anonymous individual is known to have an interest in the Adamastor and the Hesperus, the ‘ghost ships’ within those systems. Both of the derelict megaships were operated 200 years ago by Azimuth Biochemicals.

Commander Tyler Thorsen told Vox Galactica:

“I was taking some sightseers on a trip round the Hesperus, and getting as close as I dared to the Scriveners Clan dredger. I scanned the tourist beacon for them, and suddenly received a direct message from this ‘Salvation’ guy.”

“He asked me to track down some old signal beacons, which are listening posts configured to retransmit long-range comms. Apparently these could help locate the survivors from the megaship. But the Hesperus is ancient history. Surely there can’t be anything or anyone left to find?”

In April, ‘Salvation’ unofficially recruited independent pilots to locate the Hesperus, and to deliver its surviving logs to Taurus Mining Ventures.

The Pilots Federation is running an inquiry into ‘Salvation’ and his associates. Commanders are being cautioned against undertaking tasks for what may be an illegal enterprise. 

## 14 JUN

### ACT Continues to Hunt NMLA Terrorists

The Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit has published an update on its investigation into the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army.

Senior Agent Tanya Ramirez, one of ACT’s joint leaders, gave a statement to the media:

“ACT is currently pursuing multiple lines of enquiry, which must remain classified for reasons of security. Our agents are gathering evidence from sites across the Alliance, Empire and Federation.”

“As yet we cannot report any significant breakthroughs. NMLA activists appear to use a dark-comms network that defies detection. They also compartmentalise their operations, so individual cells have little knowledge of each other.”

“In recent months, NMLA incidents have been restricted to minor strikes against Imperial authorities, which were dealt with by local police forces. There has been no activity by Theta Group, the hardcore extremists responsible for the ‘Nine Martyrs’ starport bombings.”

“The collapse of the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid may have deprived the NMLA of their logistical capability to deliver large-scale attacks. But it remains possible that a new wave of terrorist atrocities is being planned.”

ACT later confirmed that it has recruited additional personnel from Alliance Interpol, the Federal Intelligence Agency, the Imperial Internal Security Service, the Marlinist Constabulary, Nova Imperium’s Praetorian Guard and the Wallglass Investigations Agency.

## 15 JUN

### Sirius Corporation: The Fourth Superpower?

The galaxy’s largest megacorporation is continuing to influence the political arena and affect billions of lives.

A review was published by Marlon Royce, business analyst for Vox Galactica:

“With its own government, laws and naval fleet, it’s not surprising that Sirius Corporation is occasionally referred to as ‘the fourth superpower’. That now seems to be its actual goal, as its impact upon interstellar politics increases.”

“When Sirius Corporation resettled the Marlinist refugees in their own colony systems, it averted war between the Empire and the Federation. But this seemingly altruistic move enabled CEO Li Yong-Rui to claim political neutrality, gaining public support to host the Galactic Summit in the Sirius system.”

“That success was undermined by the controversy of granting diplomatic status to pirate warlord Archon Delaine. Rumours of secret business dealings were reinforced when Sirius subsidiaries appeared alongside the Kumo Crew’s new starports.”

“High-level agreements were also made with the Alliance, with Sirius Atmospherics aiding colonisation of the Coalsack Nebula. But some believe that its project to terraform ammonia worlds brought retaliatory strikes from the Thargoids and enormous casualties.”

“The latest news is of a collaboration with technology brokers to make a previously limited ship module commercially available. Is this a shrewd business decision, or part of Sirius Corporation’s strategy of political dominance?”

## 16 JUN

### Electoral Reform Proposed for the Alliance

Councillor Nakato Kaine has suggested that the Alliance’s current electoral system should be replaced by direct public voting.

The proposal follows a recent election where Prime Minister Edmund Mahon was reinstated for a second six-year term.

Addressing the Alliance Assembly, Councillor Kaine said:

“Only allowing council members to choose the prime minister is a flawed system, vulnerable to corruption and outside influence. The people of the Alliance should have a direct mandate to determine their leader by casting individual votes.”

Political journalist Vanya Driscoll reported for The Alliance Tribune:

“Although Kaine stopped short of claiming that Mahon’s victory was achieved fraudulently, the Assembly took a dim view of this attempt at electoral overhaul. Some council members accused her of failing to accept that her policies received considerably less support than those of her rival.”

“Despite this, a few accepted that there could be merit in such a restructure. However, organising public voting across all Alliance systems would be much harder than in democracies with a more established infrastructure, such as the Federation, or that have smaller populations, such as the Marlinist Colonies.”

## 17 JUN

### Materials Needed for Enhanced Ship Module

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Sirius Corporation has requested commodities to make a fully engineered detailed surface scanner commercially available.

The ship module was produced in limited numbers during a terraforming programme campaign by Sirius Atmospherics in late 3306. It was awarded to pilots who provided data on worlds with ammonia-based atmospheres for its terraforming programme.

Sinclair Faraldo, marketing director for Sirius Corporation, provided details:

“Following a feasibility study, we have determined that this module can be economically mass produced for general sale. Our fully engineered detailed surface scanner has twice probe coverage, allowing planets and moons to be mapped more efficiently.”

“In order to begin production, we require large quantities of CMM composites, muon imagers and synthetic reagents. We will generously reward pilots who can deliver these to Ashby City in the Luyten’s Star system.”

The Engineered Detailed Surface Scanner V1 will be available for purchase at all human technology brokers, assuming that sufficient quantities of commodities can be obtained.

## 18 JUN

### Guardian-Thargoid Battlefield Discovered

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

An Anaconda from the Hesperus megaship has been found at a historical battlefield on the moon Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 1a.

The discovery was made by pilots who tracked down a series of signal beacons, following instructions provided by the anonymous ‘Salvation’. The beacons were deployed by the Hesperus during its voyage nearly 200 years ago.

The Anaconda, named Proteus, was one of the megaship’s secondary vessels and had been outfitted for long-range exploration. It was used by an Azimuth Biochemicals science team to flee the Hesperus after the megaship was overtaken by saboteurs from rival company Pharmasapien.

Upon landing, the Proteus was converted into a research facility to study the ancient structures and wreckage on the moon. The proximity of both Guardian and Thargoid technology suggests this was the site of a battle fought by the two civilisations over a million years ago, although in 3113 neither species had yet been identified.

Professor Alba Tesreau of Aegis Research gave this statement:

“This is a significant xenoarchaeological find – physical evidence of the war between the Guardians and the Thargoids. Our advance teams are conducting preliminary surveys, and a megaship is being prepared. Following the Alexandria’s tragic disappearance, we hope this may serve as a fresh source of Guardian artefacts for our anti-xeno research programme.”

## 21 JUN

### Corporatists Stalled by Jupiter Division’s Defeat

The fall of Jupiter Division has undermined the popular movement calling for the Federation to be governed by corporations.

Conrad Sterling, political journalist for Vox Galactica, reported on developments:

“Core Dynamics’s recent victory in the Ts’ao Tach system dealt a severe blow to the corporatists. Many companies withdrew their support even before the last shot was fired, and plans for Jupiter Division to become the movement’s central organisation have been abandoned.”

“Sighs of relief were undoubtedly breathed through the corridors of power on Mars when this threat to the Federation’s democratic principles was defeated. And yet, despite Congress downplaying it and many Federal newsfeeds neglecting to cover the story, calls for a corporatocracy have not been completely silenced.”

“Citizens who seek an alternative to voting for either Hudson or Winters are still attracted to the idea. Would corporate rule be more honest? Opinions vary, but many supporters claim ‘big business’ already possesses true power behind closed doors.”

“It now seems that history will record this as a path not taken. With Jupiter Rochester imprisoned and Jupiter Division dissolved, replacement figureheads for the corporatist movement are unlikely to arise in time to preserve it.”

## 22 JUN

### NMLA Makes Political Overtures

The Marlinism Reformation Party, which now represents the Neo-Marlinist fringe, has suggested a peace deal between the NMLA and the Empire.

Minister Aaron Whyte explained the proposal during a session of the Marlinist Parliament:

“Via anonymous intermediaries, we have received assurances that the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army is keen to take advantage of our representation. I see this as a hugely positive step that will prevent further conflict.”

“In essence, the NMLA is offering reparations for the unfortunate casualties of its anti-authority activities within the Empire. In return, it requests a permanent presence in the Imperial Senate as a means of continuing political dialogue.”

Many other parliamentarians considered the proposal to be highly controversial. Minister Octavia Volkov declared:

“Providing the NMLA with a political wing, pretending they are reasonable people, suggesting they could pay off the families of everyone they’ve murdered… Whyte, you are an insult not just to Marlinism but to all humanity!”

First Minister Jenna Fairfax called for unity, insisting that the Marlinist Colonies must stand together to ensure their survival. However, she has officially requested that the Marlinism Reformation Party reverses its stance on negotiating with the NMLA.

## 24 JUN

### Detailed Surface Scanner Campaign Reaches Target

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Pilots have delivered commodities to enable Sirius Corporation to mass produce a fully engineered detailed surface scanner.

The enhanced ship module will shortly receive a commercial release, having previously only been available during a terraforming initiative by Sirius Atmospherics in late 3306.

The Engineered Detailed Surface Scanner V1 increases probe coverage to twice the normally achievable range, offering a more efficient mapping of planetary surfaces.

The project’s success was declared by Sinclair Faraldo, marketing director for Sirius Corporation:

“We are most grateful to all pilots who brought us shipments of CMM composites, muon imagers and synthetic reagents as requested. Mass production of the enhanced detailed surface scanner has already begun, and it will be available for purchase from human technology brokers very soon.”

All pilots who took part in this campaign can now collect payment from Sirius Corporation at Ashby City in the Luyten’s Star system.

### Aegis and 'Salvation' Compete for Guardian Artefacts

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Aegis Research and Taurus Mining Ventures have requested deliveries of Guardian artefacts to the PMD2009 48 system.

Their rival campaigns follow the discovery of an ancient battleground between the Guardians and the Thargoids on Trapezium Sector YU-X c1-2 1a.

Patience Middleton, representing Taurus Mining Ventures, broadcast this statement:

“‘Salvation’ has claimed the exclusive rights to exploit the Proteus site, which was only discovered because of his specialist knowledge. He has contracted us to pay for Guardian caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns brought to the Glorious Prospect megaship.”

Aegis Research has also positioned a megaship, the Archimedes, in the PMD2009 48 system. Professor Alba Tesreau announced:

“It is vital that Aegis replaces the Guardian artefacts that were lost aboard the Alexandria. Without sufficient materials, our anti-xeno research programme will be severely hampered.”

“We recognise the risk that collecting Guardian technology on a megaship may attract the Thargoids, as happened in the Delphi system. However, this system is much farther from any known areas of Thargoid activity, so we hope to avoid drawing their attention.”

The Alliance, Empire and Federation consider depriving Aegis of resources to be a criminal act. As a result, pilots are warned that any ship modules received from Taurus Mining Ventures will be marked as ‘hot’, thereby incurring extra costs to be cleaned prior to installation.

## 25 JUN

### New Alliance Starports Become Operational

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Two Alliance stations have been constructed following a successful re-election campaign by Prime Minister Edmund Mahon.

Enterprise Market in the LHS 2522 system and Prosperity Core in the Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19 system are now fully operational. Prime Minister Mahon welcomed visitors to the new starports, promising that they would “further enhance the Alliance’s commitment to creating opportunities”.

However, Councillor Nakato Kaine triggered heated debate in the Alliance Assembly when she made this announcement:

“My investigation turned up irregularities in the tritium mining campaign, suggesting that it only received enough deliveries to allow one starport to be built. Furthermore, docking records seem to indicate that Sirius Corporation made up the shortfall with a number of unregistered donations.”

“Sirius Corporation now has a presence in the Sharru Sector FW-W c1-19 system. This suggests disturbing parallels with the company’s recent dealings to help build Archon Delaine’s new starports. The question is – what did Mahon promise in return?”

A statement from the Office of the Prime Minister clarified that Sirius Corporation was one of many companies currently partnered with the Alliance to support its expansion programme. It did not address the discrepancy in tritium deliveries or refer to any contributions from the megacorp.

## 28 JUN

### Imperial Senate Considers Marlinist Diplomacy

A proposal for the Empire to formally open diplomatic relations with the Marlinist Colonies has been made by Senator Lorcan Scordato.

The eight systems are populated by ex-Imperial citizens who fled to avoid persecution for their beliefs in Marlinism, which advocates democratic representation.

Returning from a fact-finding mission to the colonies, Senator Scordato told the Senate:

“The Marlinist community is primarily focused on peaceful co-existence alongside the Empire, rather than trying to reform the Republic of Achenar. And now that Minister Aaron Whyte speaks for the Neo-Marlinists, we have an opportunity to prevent further extremist actions via diplomacy.”

Although some senators agreed, others such as Denton Patreus stressed that “As a matter of honour and principle, the Empire does not negotiate with terrorists.”

Several newsfeeds observed that both the Alliance and the Federation are looking into opening formal diplomatic channels with the Marlinist Colonies. Similar debates have occurred in the Assembly and Congress regarding the acceptance of an NMLA political wing.

First Minister Jenna Fairfax has repeated calls for the Marlinism Reformation Party to cease representing the Neo-Marlinist fringe. However, she also announced plans for a Marlinist equivalent to the Imperial Diplomatic Corps that would undertake ambassadorial duties.

## 29 JUN

### Four Federal Systems Declare Independence

The Azaladshu Free faction, which controls four systems, has seceded from the Federation in protest against civilian surveillance.

The unexpected declaration followed the election of new leadership for Azaladshu Free, which currently controls the Azaladshu, LFT 824, LHS 277 and LTT 3919 systems.

Mayor Constanza Noguera announced:

“The Federation has become corrupt, authoritarian and untrustworthy. In particular, the public surveillance laws to spy on innocent people cannot be tolerated. From now on, we will govern our systems as independent sovereign nations.”

Political observers believe that several other Federal factions are also planning to declare independence. All are within Shadow President Felicia Winters’s sphere of influence, although she has publicly renounced any support of these actions.

Congress has stated that secession is illegal under the Federal Accord, and ordered Azaladshu Free to revert to normal membership status. The Federal Navy and other military organisations have been placed on alert.

President Hudson has reacted strongly, stating that “This degree of organised criminal behaviour only proves that the Proactive Detection Bureau is needed to maintain order.”

Shadow President Winters countered by claiming “Removing our citizens’ right to privacy is the cause of this rebellion, not the solution.”
