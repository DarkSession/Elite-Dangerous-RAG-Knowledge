**New York**, also called **New York City**, is an ancient city on Earth in the Sol system. Since it was located in the main territory of the former United States of the Americas, it presumably avoided any damage from nuclear weapons during World War III in the mid-21st century. By the 34th century, it had become a tradition for the President of the Federation to attend an annual Presidential Christmas Eve banquet in New York.

## Timeline

25 DEC 3300

- After the traditional Presidential Christmas Eve banquet in New York on Earth in Sol last night, the President was confronted by a crowd protesting against 'Oniongate' - and the bombing of fields and farms on Panem in Kappa Fornacis. Struggling to speak above the noise of the crowd chanting "Babykiller", President Halsey answered questions from the press. "I have heard about the terrible events on Panem. I did not issue any orders to crack down on the narcotic onionhead, and certainly did not authorise bombings of the surface. Admiral Vincent has operated without my authority and I have asked for an enquiry to see how this happened." This is a surprising development, as it seems unlikely Admiral Vincent would have acted without support from the top. Some are saying this is Halsey washing her hands of the problem.^[1]^
