From within, the "bleeding heart" of the **Orion Nebula** becomes dark, with blood-red smudges aross the sky. The nearby Running Man nebula blends into it subtly, like a purple flower. 

The brightest star within the Orion Nebula is MX Orionis; it's nowhere near the size of the huge EZ Orionis though. There are some gas giants with rocky moons orbiting it. 

Right behind the nebula lies Parenago 2149, an interesting binary where all the planets orbit not the main hot blue star, but its dead neutron companion.

There's an Asteroid Base called the Orion Nebula Tourist Centre in system PMD2009 48. It has a shipyard, outfitting and black-market. 

[ As of the current version of the game within April of 2020, there is a band of stars inside the orion nebula. this is unintended. if you notice, when bookmarking sol, the band points directly towards it as seen from behind the band. this leads an obvious explanation, its simple telescope data that got miscalculated due to the nebulaâ€™s interference. elite dangerous gets all of its stars by a computer putting in real data of stars, and simply the stars along the orion nebula most likely conflicted with it, so the computer put all their distances relevant to the orion nebula. This will probably be fixed. ]
