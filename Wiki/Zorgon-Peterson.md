Zorgon Peterson (ZP) specializes in small and medium transport and combat ships, with exceptional hyperspace jump capability for vessels of that size and price range.

While ZP mostly produces low-cost freighter and multipurpose ships, the Fer-de-Lance is a favorite for bounty hunters who love luxury and cutting-edge technology. The company's motto "finesse follows function" is visible in the curvilinear and functional design. Its interiors are simple and functional, maintaining an elegant touch. ZP vessels tend to have smaller windows than contemporaries. The horizontal glazing in the cabins limits vertical visibility. The interior regularly has gray synthetic materials with light touches of metal. Cabins with more than 1 seat have the pilot seat on the right side.

## History

Zorgon Peterson became a subsidiary of Faulcon DeLacy in 3126. 

On 19 September 3300, a Ship Sales Services Report said Zorgon Peterson had market share of 26% versus Core Dynamics at 13.6%, and Faulcon DeLacy's 41.6%.^[1]^ 

On 11 December 3304, ZP's Mamba and Faulcon Delacy's Krait Phantom were released on the market.^[2]^ ZP made a press statement: *“If it’s speed and firepower you want, the Mamba is for you. Based on a racing prototype, it’s the fastest commercially available starship, and it sports enough hardpoints for a range of devastating weaponry. Whether you’re leaving competitors in the dust or running rings around those pesky Thargoids, think Mamba!”*^[2]^
