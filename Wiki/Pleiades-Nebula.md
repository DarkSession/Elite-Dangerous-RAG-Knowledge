# Pleiades Nebula
Maia Nebula around the Pleiades star cluster
 		 	 

The **Pleiades Nebula**, also known as the **Pleiades**, the **Seven Sisters**, and **Messier 45**, is an open star cluster located in the constellation of Taurus. It is 384 light-years from Sol.^[1]^ Around the Pleiades star cluster is a reflection nebula. It is caused by dust reflecting the blue light of the hot, young stars.^[2]^ The nine brightest stars of the Pleiades are named after the Seven Sisters of Greek mythology and their parents: Alcyone, Atlas, Celaeno, Electra, Maia, Merope, Pleione, Sterope (Asterope), Taygeta.

## History

The region became a major focus of public and scientific attention in 3301, after it was discovered that newly-discovered alien objects were transmitting signals to the Merope system. Obsidian Orbital was constructed in Maia later that year, becoming the first starport located in a nebula and paving the way for further colonization. The discovery of Alien Structures and Meta-Alloys in the region provoked a brief gold rush and proxy-war between the Federation and Empire. Following additional Thargoid-related discoveries and encounters in 3302 and 3303, such as Thargoid Probes, Hyperdictions, and Thargoid Surface Sites, the Pleiades have borne the brunt of a Thargoid incursion that has destroyed Federal and Imperial military fleets, crippled civilian Megaships, and severely damaged numerous stations, resulting in thousands of human casualties.
