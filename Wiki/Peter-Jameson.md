## Notes

- The Frontier: Elite II Game Manual (which is not considered canon in Elite: Dangerous) cites Peter Jameson is the grandfather of J. Jameson Jr. (and by extension the father of J. Jameson) and that Peter Jameson died in 3199.^[4]^ It can be assumed that J. Jameson probably means John Jameson, but until this is confirmed within *Elite Dangerous* it is not considered canon.
