# Ethos
An **Ethos** dictates each Power's methods for preparing, expanding. and controlling systems. They determine the amount of expansion or fortification necessary to succeed in systems depending on their government type. They also hint at what kind of action the pledged Commanders will be expected to do in Powerplay.

## Effectiveness

Possible Ethos are: Combat, Covert, Finance, and Social.

Being strong means the expansion or fortification trigger is reduced by half. Being weak means the triggers are increased by half.

- Combat Ethos is strong against Feudal and Patronage governments. It is weak against Dictatorship governments.

- Covert Ethos is strong against Feudal, Dictatorship, Communist and Cooperative governments. It is weak against Democracy governments.

- Finance Ethos is strong against Corporate governments. It is weak against Communist, Cooperative, Feudal and Patronage governments.

- Social Ethos is strong against Communist, Cooperative and Confederacy governments. It is weak against Feudal, Prison colony and Theocracy governments.

Curiously enough, no Power makes its expansion in Covert Ethos.
