# Materials
Polonium and a SRV
 		 	 

**Materials** are small resources that are primarily used for Engineering, Synthesis, and unlocking specialised items via a Technology Broker. Material Traders at certain stations can exchange 1 Material type for a quantity of another Material.

Materials do not require space in Cargo Racks.^[1]^ Instead, Materials have a separate inventory and are stored in smaller quantities that do not affect a ship's overall mass. Materials remain accessible when switching between a ship, SRV or SLF. If a commander loses their vehicle or is critically injured, none of their Materials are lost.

## Grades

All Materials are sorted into different grades representing their rarity, with rarer materials providing greater effects when used. Manufactured and Encoded Materials use five grades, from Very Common to Very Rare, while Raw Materials only use four, from Very Common to Rare. A Material's grade determines how much of it can be stored at once.

| Symbol | Grade | Rarity | Storage Capacity per Material |

## Types

Materials are classified into one of three types determined by their origin and composition:

- **Raw Materials** - Naturally-occurring chemical elements; usually obtained by mining and SRV prospecting.
- **Manufactured Materials** - Artificial components from ships and structures; usually obtained by salvaging.
- **Encoded Materials** - Pieces of data, such as files, chunks of code, and scans; usually obtained by scanning objects.

## List of materials

Materials are further classified in categories. These are taken into account by Material Traders when exchanging materials.

The **category page** has a list of all materials.
