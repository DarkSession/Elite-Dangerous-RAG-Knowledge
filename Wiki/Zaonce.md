## History

Sometime before his election as President of the Alliance in October 3303, Gibson Kincaid served as the governor of Zaonce. Kincaid was re-elected for a second presidential term in October 3304, and his campaign to transfer executive powers from the Alliance Prime Minister to the presidency resulted in the Alliance Assembly approving more moderate changes to the presidency's term length and role. On June 7, 3305, it came to light that Kincaid was the mastermind behind a conspiracy involving Admiral Frederick Yamamoto and other influential corporate, military, and political leaders which sought to move the Alliance's capital from Alioth to Zaonce and eventually establish Kincaid as the Alliance's supreme ruler. The conspiracy was derailed by its exposure, as well as the revelation of the various crimes committed on Kincaid's orders.^[1]^ Alliance Interpol apprehended Kincaid, who had by then been removed from office by the Alliance Assembly and was attempting to flee his personal estate, and several conspirators on June 13, and charged them treason, murder, and corruption.^[2]^
