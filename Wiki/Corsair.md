> The Corsair is further evidence of Gutamaya's mastery of multi-role ship designs. It offers a generous number of internal compartments, significant cargo capacity, and impressive straight-line speed and agility. With appropriate outfitting the Corsair performs very well in all ship roles, outclassed only by dedicated role vessels. This craft also takes full advantage of an overcharged Frame Shift Drive's capabilities.

## Overview

 	 	[![Corsair Gutamaya Detailed Overview](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/66/Corsair_Gutamaya_Detailed_Overview.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20250410130535)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/66/Corsair_Gutamaya_Detailed_Overview.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20250410130535) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Corsair Detailed Overview
 		 	 

The Corsair has a size 7 Power Plant, size 7 thrusters, a size 7 Power Distributor, up to 10 optional internals, and 6 hardpoints.^[3]^^[4]^ It's designed to do all three main roles equally.^[1]^ As a multirole ship, it is thus superior to the Python.^[2]^ It can carry up to an impressive 318t of cargo, giving the Corsair the highest cargo capacity of all medium ships apart from the Type-8 Transporter. The Corsair's max speed through engineering is capped at 600 m/s, though the size 7 Thrusters ensure it will reliably reach this speed even with most high-mass load outs.^[4]^

Corsair view from the cockpit
 		 	 

The ship has blue neon strip lights that highlight the shape of the hull, and minimal heat vents that fit inside the ship.^[1]^ The cockpit is similar to the Imperial Courier with an extra seat.^[2]^ Ports on the outer edges of the nacelles allow the thrusters to be observed externally, spinning faster as the ship accelerates. As a departure from earlier Imperial Gutamaya ships which feature weapon Hardpoints on their nacelles, all of the Corsair's Hardpoints are located on its fuselage, affording much tighter weapon convergence.

## Development

The Corsair was unveiled during a Frontier Unlocked livestream on 26 February 2025.^[1]^ As previous medium SCO native ships covered Combat, Trading and Exploration (in the Python Mk II, Type-8 and Mandalay respectively), the Corsair represents the first new multi-purpose medium ship.

## Trivia

When first released, the Corsair had a mass lock factor of 7, which is unusually low for a ship of its size. This placed its mass locking ability on par with much smaller ships such as the Adder or Imperial Courier. This oversight was fixed in the Trailblazers Update 3 on 30 April, 2025.^[5]^
