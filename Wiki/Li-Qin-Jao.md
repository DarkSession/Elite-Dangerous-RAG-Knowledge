Hyperdrive Inventor

**Li Qin Jao**, sometimes spelled **Li Qing Jao**, was the leader of the team of engineers who invented the first hyperdrive in the 22nd century. The advent of faster-than-light travel allowed conventional ships to easily overtake the thousands of Generation Ships that had been launched since 2097, and in 2151 humanity established its first colony outside of Sol on Taylor Colony in Tau Ceti. Jao's invention consequently spurred a wave of colonization beyond Sol that gave rise to the Core Systems and modern human spacefaring civilization.^[1]^ The starport Li Qing Jao orbiting Earth was named in Jao's honour.
