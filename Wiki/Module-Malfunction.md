## Overview

If one or more modules malfunction, it will either limit the functionality of those modules, or they will behave in an faulty manner. For example when a power plant malfunctions its output is halved, while a hardpoint may fire by itself. The Pulse Disruptor and the Scramble Spectrum cause targets to quickly malfunction. Other weapons need some *effort* to cause a module malfunction. Malfunctions may occur when a module is damaged yet still operational. A module at 0% health is inoperable until it's repaired. 

## Causes

These are the causes of a module malfunction:

1. Weapon fires - While a weapon is firing it will malfunction.
2. Titan's pulse - The Thargoid Titan in Maelstroms can emit a pulse similar to a  Thargoid shutdown field. They can cause a ship's modules to malfunction, restart the FSD, caustic damage etc. When this happens, an orange triangle icon appears in the HUD. This is preventable with a Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser.
3. Gravitational - Performing a drop at a neutron star or a white dwarf can cause modules to overload and lead to catastrophic malfunctions. It's difficult to escape a neutron star due its gravitational force. The heat level of charging a FSD can slowly cook a ship and the pilot.

## Risks

Each module a different risk:

1. Thruster - Randomly moves the ship without control
2. Power Plant - Output is reduced in half. Modules will be offline due to insufficient power and cannot deploy hardpoints. The module pirority control feature can keep some modules online even if the output power exceeds 50%.
3. FSD - the FSD is temporarily disrupted and unable to charge. It can cause an emergency drop in Supercruise. The "Frame Shift Online" message appears when the FSD malfunction expires.
4. Shutdown Field Neutraliser, Electronic Countermeasure, Chaff - Temporarily misfires the Neutraliser and reduces the launch range.
5. Power Distributor - Temporarily scrambles the distributor and randomly changes pips every second.
6. Weapons - Randomly fires weapons without a pilot's control.
7. Cargo Scoop - Jettisons cargo or uncontrollably opens and closes.

## Indications

If a module malfunctions, the HUD will display a warning in the center of the canopy. This will thereafter be listed in notifications. If a Titan's pulse or a Scramble Spectrum / Pulse Disruptor hits the ship, it will show an orange triangle.

## Trivia

- Collisions cannot disable modules, because the modules are located inside the ship's hull.
- NPC ships don't seems to be affected by module malfunctions.
