## History

In 2559, the tourist liner Everichon, full of Imperial nobles, was hijacked in Alioth by a Caker group who planned to crash it into one of the system's gas giants. The attempt was thwarted by the Imperial commandos. The holo-vid broadcast and subsequent fictional dramatisation "Rebel Madness", went some way to diverting popular opinion from the insurrection.^[1]^
