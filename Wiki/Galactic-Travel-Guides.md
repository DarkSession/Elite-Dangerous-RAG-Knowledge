**Galactic Travel Guides** were a Salvage Rare Commodity. They were exclusively sold at Bluford Orbital in LHS 3447 for the duration of the Colonia Expansion Initiative. Pilots who desired to establish minor factions in the Colonia Region were tasked by the Colonia Council with delivering Galactic Travel Guides to Colonia in a series of Community Goals; the groups that delivered the most Galactic Travel Guides in each wave were granted the right to colonise a system in the region.
