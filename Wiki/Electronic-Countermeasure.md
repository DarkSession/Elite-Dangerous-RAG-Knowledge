## Usage

To use an Electronic Countermeasure, it must first be assigned to a fire group. When the ship is targeted by hostile seeker missiles, torpedoes, or Hatch Breaker limpets, the ECM can be fired to break their targeting locks. Holding the trigger will extend the range of the ECM's effect up to a maximum of 3 kilometers, and there is no limit to how many hostile munitions can be thrown off in a single use. After it is used, the ECM enters a cooldown phase that lasts 10 seconds before it can be used again. 

The effect on munitions varies:

- Seeker missiles lose their targeting lock and will expire without hitting the target.
- Torpedoes lose their targeting lock for a few seconds, remaining in place, then will reacquire their target.
- Any limpets within the ECM's range will be destroyed.
- Thargoid "unknown missiles" fired by Thargoid Hunters lose their targeting lock.
- Thargoid caustic missiles are not affected by the ECM.
- Thargoid collection or hatch breaker limpets within the ECM's range will be destroyed.
