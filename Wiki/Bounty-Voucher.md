Uncashed Bounty Vouchers
 		 	 

A **Bounty Vouchers** is a type of claim earned through combat against criminal ships and skimmers. They can be redeemed at any station's local security office for their full value in credits, or at an Interstellar Factor contact for a 25% reduction in value.

The amount of rewarded credits for each ship varies greatly and depends mostly on ship class and combat rank. In general, the larger and higher-ranked a ship is, the more credits its Bounty Voucher will be worth. Collected Bounty Vouchers can be viewed under the Transactions tab of the left HUD panel. Note that any vouchers collected by a pilot are lost if that pilot's ship is destroyed before they can be redeemed.

## Notes

- Resource extraction sites seem to yield the highest bounties by far.
- Make sure to use a Kill Warrant Scanner to maximize potential bounty gains, if possible. The bounty value of an Anaconda or a Fer-de-Lance can sometimes surpass 400,000 total, or even more rarely, up to 500,000. In even rarer cases, it is even possible for the total bounties on a high-end ship to exceed 600,000 or even 700,000.
- Bounty Voucher values were increased by between four and ten times their original values in a balancing pass on November 30, 2020.^[1]^^[2]^
