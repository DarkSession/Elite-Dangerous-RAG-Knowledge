# Loitering
Station Defence Turret
 		 	 

**Loitering** is the act of standing or waiting around without apparent purpose. At stations, loitering is a crime and punishable by death. Less time is given to clear the Access Corridor. If a pilot violates station regulations such as by loitering on a landing pad or blocking the Access Corridor then the Defence Turrets will open fire on the ship.
