# Overcharged Weapon
**Overcharged Weapon** is an engineer modification that can be applied to weapons. It increases damage output at the cost of increased distributor draw, increased thermal load, and reduced clip size (in the case of Multi-cannons).

It is available in 5 grades, with the highest grade offering up to 70% increase in damage output.
