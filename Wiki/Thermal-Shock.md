# Thermal Shock
**Thermal Shock** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to weapons through Engineering. It is an articulated focus array designed to spread heat effectively. Strikes to shields and hull impart additional heat into the target, at the expense of a 10% reduction in damage.

This effect has minimal benefit against other players, but can be a powerful tool against NPCs. NPCs will not boost or use high-heat weapons when overheated, so by maintaining constant fire with this experimental effect, NPCs can be almost entirely disabled. Importantly, larger ships have a higher heat capacity, so it may take multiple weapons engineered with this effect to have an impact on them.

## Applicability

This effect is available to the following weapons:

- Beam Laser
- Burst Laser
- Multi-cannon
- Pulse Laser

## Required Materials

- 5x Flawed Focus Crystals
