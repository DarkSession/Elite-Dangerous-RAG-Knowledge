**Taylor Colony** is the second planet in the Tau Ceti system. It was the site of humanity's first extrasolar colony, which was established in 2151 in the years following the invention of the first hyperdrive by Li Qin Jao.  Tau Ceti 2 (as it was then called) was chosen because it already supported the first discovered life in space.^[1]^ This would become a point of contention between the early Tau Ceti colonists and the Earth-based Federation, as the former repeatedly violated Federal ecological protocols and caused widespread damage to the planet's native ecosystem.^[2]^^[3]^ In 2240, a military task force arrived from Earth to place the colony under martial law, but found an insurrection already underway and prepared to face them. In 2242, after the conflict stalemated, a negotiated settlement was reached and the Federation's constitution was revised into the Federation Accord.^[4]^ Tau Ceti, Sol, Beta Hydri, Delta Pavonis, and Altair became the first five signatories of the Federation Accord, which established the modern Federation as the first interstellar superpower.

## Notes

- The namesake is John Taylor, an esteemed long-standing civil administrator elected in 2161, a proponent of the colony's independence and likely a criminal co-responsible for the destruction of local ecosystem.^[2]^
