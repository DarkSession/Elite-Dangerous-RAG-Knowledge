In the structures are Obelisks â€“ some are lit up with symbols. These symbols indicate which items you need on board in order to retrieve the message from the obelisk. The Obelisk displays pictograms of the items required for a successful scan.^[1]^ Once you have the correct items in your SRV approach the obelisk and scan with the SRV data link scanner.
