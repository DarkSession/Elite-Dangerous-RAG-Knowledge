**Power Plants** are nuclear fusion reactors which supply ships with energy. They consume and fuse fuel (hydrogen atoms) to release the energy in the form of heat. This energy is converted into electricity and measured in watts. Power plants are not 100% efficient at converting fusion heat into electricity, so some energy is lost as waste heat and must be exhausted through radiation panels. The fusion process also produces helium in a highly-energized plasma state. This plasma is exhausted through the engine's ionisation grids to produce thrust. Larger power plants are able to produce more energy, while power plants with higher ratings are more efficient.

In the event that a ship's Power Plant is disabled during combat, its power output is halved, but module priority control can be used to keep some important modules powered. Repeated strikes to a "disabled" Power Plant can potentially cause a catastrophic breach in its containment systems, which can destroy a ship regardless of its remaining hull integrity.

With the introduction of Guardian Hybrid Power Plants on February 27, 3304, the base prices of all standard Power Plants were marked down to account for the depreciation of human technology.^[1]^
