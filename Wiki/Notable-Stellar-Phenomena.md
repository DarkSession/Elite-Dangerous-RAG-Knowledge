### Activities

**Notable Stellar Phenomena** are a type of signal source found in certain star systems, at stellar or planetary lagrange points or in Planetary Ring Systems. Each instance usually features a colorful Lagrange Cloud surrounding various organic or inorganic entities. These entities can be scanned by a Short Range Composition Scanner to obtain Codex data, and samples can be extracted from some of the organics with Research Limpets.

Notable Stellar Phenomena have been artificially replicated by the Holloway Bioscience Institute in the form of Experimental Habitats.
