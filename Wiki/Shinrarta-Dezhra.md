**Shinrarta Dezhra** is an independent system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It is the headquarters of the Pilots Federation, and access is restricted to pilots who have acquired the Founders World Permit, which can be earned by achieving an Elite rank in Combat, Trade, Exploration, Mercenary, or Exobiology, or through "secretive methods". Shinrarta Dezhra's chief attraction is Jameson Memorial, a Starport named for one of the storied Jamesons that stocks all ships and modules and offers them at a 10% discount; the station is also the exclusive distributor of Waters of Shintara, a rare commodity. In addition, The Dark Wheel maintains a presence in the system, and the Engineer Lori Jameson can be found at Jameson Base.

## Notes

- The "secretive methods" of gaining entry to Shinrarta Dezhra mentioned in the system's description refers to how Kickstarter backers of *Elite Dangerous* were given the Founders World Permit as a reward. Unlike other players, Kickstarter backers possess the permit from the moment they start the game, and can enter Shinrarta Dezhra without any Pilots Federation ranks.^[1]^
- The top Kickstarter pledge for Elite Dangerous allowed a backer (forum user Liqua) to "name the secret founder's system." The name has a hidden meaning.^[2]^
    - Shinrarta Dezhra's meaning was seemingly revealed in the novel *Elite Dangerous: Premonition*, written by Drew Wagar and released in 2017. According to the character Luko Giovanni, "Shinrarta Dezhra" means "Life, she saw, hope" in ancient Earth languages (Russian and Arabic). The name is further broken down in the text: Shinrarta Dezhra is the simplified form of *Zhizn Ra'at Nadezhda*, with *zhizn* meaning "life" in Russian, *ra'at* meaning "she saw" in Arabic, and *nadezhda* meaning "hope" in Russian.
- Shinrarta Dezhra is one of the few systems that is immune to being controlled or exploited in Powerplay.^[3]^
- The name of Shinrarta Dezhra in the Hipparcos catalogue is HIP 59296
