**Kappa Fornacis** is an Imperial system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. In recent years it became known as the source of the Rare Commodity Onionhead, which is sold at Harvestport. The Federation unsuccessfully tried to destroy the Onionhead crops on the planet Panem after the narcotic was banned by Federal President Jasmina Halsey in late 3300, when Kappa Fornacis was still an Independent system under the Kappa Fornacis Farmers Union. Years later in 3305, an extremist group called the Scythe of Panem, bent on revenge against the Federation, was responsible for spreading a blight that devastated staple crops in dozens of systems and nearly triggered an interstellar famine.

## History

In late 3300 President Jasmina Halsey declared the rare narcotic 'Onionhead' illegal throughout Federal space. Onionhead is the fruit of an alien plant on Panem in the Kappa Fornacis system.^[1]^

Georgio Algeria, spokesman for the Farmer's Cooperative in the Kappa Fornacis system, accused the President of victimisation.^[1]^

Tensions between the Onionhead cultivators and the Federation continued to rise, culminating in the bombing of Panem by the Federal Navy. This action seemed to have little effect as a brand new strain of Onionhead was subsequently discovered in markets, having been cultivated somewhere on Luca in the Tanmark system.^[1]^
