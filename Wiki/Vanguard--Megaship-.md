**Vanguard** was a Flight Operations Carrier Megaship, and one of two military flagships deployed by Aegis. Vanguard and its sister ship, Acropolis, served as mobile command centers for anti-Thargoid operations, and were periodically relocated based on data obtained from Eagle Eye to wherever Aegis deemed they could be the most strategically effective.^[1]^

No sightings of Vanguard or Acropolis have been reported since December 13, 3304. The two flagships are believed to have been retired by Aegis and replaced by a fleet of similar Megaships.
