Bubble Nebula
 		 	 

The **Bubble Nebula** looks like a particularly bright star on the galaxy map, but when you zoom in, you can see that it is a blue nebula in the shape of a bubble.

A nearby star system (Bubble Sector DL-Y d34) provided awesome views of the nebula from the surface of a lifeless planet. The nebula filled up nearly the whole horizon, and eclipsed all other stellar bodies in the sky. Arriving inside the nebula was a great experience. There is no black sky anywhere - it's all blue, everywhere you look.
