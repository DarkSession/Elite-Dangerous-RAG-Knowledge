Fleet carrier crews

**Pathfinder Solutions** is a crew agency. In 3306, with the debut of the Drake-Class Carrier, Brewer Corporation partnered with Pathfinder Solutions to provide crews for their vessels. After an independent pilot purchased a Drake-Class Carrier from a Brewer Corporation representative, that representative would notify Pathfinder Solutions, and a crew would be immediately dispatched to the vessel's location to prepare it for its maiden voyage.^[1]^

Drake-Class Carrier crews provided by Pathfinder Solutions always included the officers and personnel necessary to operate the vessel's three essential services: the Bridge Crew, the Commodities Market, and the Tritium Depot.
