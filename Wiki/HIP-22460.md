**HIP 22460** is an uninhabited system near the Pleiades Nebula within the Inner Orion Spur. Prior to 3303, it was a major staging point for the covert paramilitary unit Black Flight and a research hub for Project Seraph, which was analyzing two local Thargoid Surface Sites. Access to HIP 22460 is restricted, and requires a permit that is given to all players by default.

After the failure of Salvation's Proteus Wave in August 9, 3308, the Thargoids destroyed most human presence in the system. Pilots that travel to HIP 22460 should exercise extreme caution, as the Thargoids will attack on sight and in large numbers.  In addition, a lingering energy field exists in HIP 22460 that will damage and disable Hybrid modules.  The damage will negate the effects of Auto Field-Maintenance Units.  While normal human derived modules are not effected, the constant damage and disabling of Hybrid modules from simply being in the system means that any combat with the Thargoids is not only ill-advised, but should be avoided at all costs.  Explorers are advised to avoid contact and make heavy use of Silent Running whenever possible to avoid Thargoid detection, as all Thargoids will be instantly hostile, regardless if they possess Guardian, Hybrid, or Thargoid items or technology in their ships.

## Notes

- Initially, HIP 22460 was not permit-locked, and could be freely visited by players. From the time the permit requirement was added until August 26, 3307, when the permit first became obtainable, players who had previously scanned the system were still able to view its System Map and observed that it contained a Flight Operations Carrier megaship named Overlook, which was controlled by the Pleiades Resource Enterprise, a Federation-aligned minor faction. At the same time the permit became available, Overlook was retconned into a Bulk Cruiser megaship, removing the Pleiades Resource Enterprise's presence in the system.
- Before the permit was given to all players, it could only be obtained by scanning the Listening Post located in Synuefe GB-O c9-8.
