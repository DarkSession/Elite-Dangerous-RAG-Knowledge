# Guardian Module Reinforcement Package

> Powered module that protects a ship's modules from any weapons fire penetrating the hull. It utilises its own damage capacity to absorb a proportion of the damage applied to modules, eventually burning out when its capacity reaches zero. This version is based on Guardian research and has resistances to Thargoid-specific disruption technology.

The **Guardian Module Reinforcement Package** is a module derived from Guardian technology. When powered, it reduces the damage that other ship modules receive from weapon hits until it is depleted, and also provides protection against HUD scrambling and forced module reboots caused by a Thargoid Interceptor's lightning attack. In order to purchase the Guardian Module Reinforcement Package, it must first be unlocked through a Technology Broker.
