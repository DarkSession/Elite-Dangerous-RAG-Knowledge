**Stolon Trees** are massive plant-like organic structures found in Notable Stellar Phenomena. They consist of multiple bulbous, bioluminscent limbs growing from a central cluster, and the ends of several limbs are tipped with Stolon Pods. Thus far, they have only been found in the Outer Scutum-Centaurus Arm.
