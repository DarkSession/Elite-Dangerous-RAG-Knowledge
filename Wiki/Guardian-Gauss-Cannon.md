## Usage

Compared to a conventional Railgun, the Gauss Cannon draws more power, generates more heat, penetrates armour more effectively, deals somewhat more damage, and has a longer range before damage falloff begins. Unlike AX weaponry it is still highly effective against human ships, though its armour penetration is excessively high for most man-made ships, and a well-Engineered Railgun of the same class will likely outperform a Gauss Cannon against human vessels.

When powered and deployed, Gauss Cannons will emit a cyan glow from their core. This effect is altered by the use of custom Weapon Colours.

## Unlocking

Different classes of the Guardian Gauss Cannon can be permanently unlocked for purchase by providing the following Materials to a Guardian Technology Broker:

- Fixed, Class 1

    - 12 Guardian Power Conduit
    - 12 Guardian Sentinel Wreckage Components
    - 15 Guardian Sentinel Weapon Parts

- Fixed, Class 2
    - 1 Guardian Weapon Blueprint Fragment
    - 18 Guardian Power Cell
    - 20 Guardian Technology Component
    - 15 Manganese
    - 6 Magnetic Emitter Coil

## Engineer Modifications

The Guardian Gauss Cannon can be modified with the Anti-Guardian Zone Resistance, preventing its decay over time in systems or areas where the Thargoids deployed an anti-Guardian field.

## Purchase Locations

The Guardian Gauss Cannon is available for purchase at all stations where a Guardian Technology Broker is present after the module has been unlocked.

| Class | Rating | System | Station | Weapon Mode | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | B | Shinrarta Dezhra | Jameson Memorial | Fixed |  |
| 2 | B | LHS 20 | Ohm City | Fixed |  |
| 2 | B | Mehuenomici | Bohr Gateway | Fixed |  |

## Modified Gauss Cannon

Pre-Engineered Class 1 and Class 2 Guardian Gauss Cannons with High Capacity and a special Burst Fire modification named "Modified Gauss Cannon" can be purchased from the Guardian Technology Broker at Bright Sentinel and Prospect's Deep in Mbooni. Unlike unlocking most other Technology Broker items, which makes them permanently available for purchase with credits at station outfitting services, unlocking a Modified Gauss Cannon immediately places one module in local storage at no additional cost. The module must also be unlocked repeatedly in order to obtain multiple copies. Note that although the included modifications can be removed, Engineers cannot re-apply them or apply any other modifications to these modules.
