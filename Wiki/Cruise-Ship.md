A **Cruise Ship** is a roving signal source that consists of a commercial cruise liner traversing a star system on a scenic tour. These ships broadcast various messages on public comms channels that can be picked up while traveling in supercruise.

## Contents

Cruise Ship encounters consist of a single non-hostile Dolphin, Orca, or Beluga Liner. They can be interdicted, but are not equipped to defend themselves and carry few valuables. If left alone, Cruise Ships will eventually arrive at a station and drop into normal space.

## Spawn Locations

Cruise Ships can appear in shipping lanes in any populated system.
