Cluster Compound with asteroids
 		 	 

**Cluster Compound** is a CQC Championship arena. It is located in a vast and dense asteroid field, making it a deadly battleground. It was the the third confirmed arena. ^[1]^^[2]^

## Notes

- Cluster Compound is located in the Eta Cephei system in the rings of planet 1, but cannot be directly accessed outside of a normal CQC match because there is no navigation marker for it.
