    - *Not to be confused with Imperial Courier.*

Starport bulletin boards will often offer missions that require little or no cargo space and can be an easy (albeit low) source of income. Missions that require no cargo space will be marked with two horizontal arrows pointing left and right whereas courier missions that require some cargo space are marked with a cargo container and an arrow pointing to the right. Accepted missions can be turned in (completed) by traveling to the mission's destination and using the starport bulletin board there. The completion gives points to the trader rank.

## Notes

- Failing to complete the mission in the allotted time will result in a mission failure, the mission goods will be marked as stolen, and the player will be fined.
