## Raw Material Sources

Raw materials can be found on landable stellar bodies (low gravity and flat surface are much preferred), signal sources, and through asteroid mining. Also "raw" Material Trader can exchange materials you own for materials you want to obtain.

Material sources on planets and moons can be located by use of the Wave Scanner of an SRV. When they are destroyed by weapons fire from a ship or SRV they explode into chunks of materials, which can be collected using a ship or SRV's Cargo Scoop.

The type of materials vary depending on the geology of the body, the type of world it is and where it is situated.^[1]^ As well as sources which are natural parts of the body, there are meteorites which fell from space, cargo racks of downed ships, and various Thargoid and Guardian structures.

### Surface Prospecting

Landable stellar bodies can be analyzed by a Detailed Surface Scanner to reveal the materials available when prospecting, and a given body will always have 1 Rare (Grade 4) material, 2 Standard (Grade 3) materials, 3 Common (Grade 2) materials, and 5 Very Common (Grade 1) materials as part of its possible material yields from surface prospecting. As Lead and Rhenium are only available from asteroid mining, the 5 Very Common (Grade 1) materials on planet surfaces will always be Carbon, Iron, Nickel, Phosphorus, and Sulphur.

For example, surface prospecting on Frey 3 A can result in Iron, Sulphur, Carbon, Nickel, Phosphorus, Chromium, Manganese, Vanadium, Cadmium, Tungsten, and Tellurium^[2]^. No other resources can be found regardless of when or where the prospecting takes place on the planet; no Selenium, Germanium, Mercury, *etc.* can ever be found there.

## List of Raw Materials

Raw materials range from Very Common (Grade 1) to Rare (Grade 4); Very Rare (Grade 5) raw materials do not exist.
