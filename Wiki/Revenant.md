The **Revenant** is a biomechanical combat drone created by the Thargoids. They bear a resemblance to the previously encountered Thargoid Scavenger drones; however, they are significantly better armed and armored.

## Overview

They can often be found at abandoned settlements in Thargoid territory, patrolling for any life signs. If they spot humans they rapidly become aggressive and attack. 

On occasion, Thargoid Scouts may approach an abandoned surface settlement and deploy Revenants.
