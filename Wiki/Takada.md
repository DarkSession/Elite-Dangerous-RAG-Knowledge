## History

Established in 3223 as a haulage company, Takada soon found itself dominating the industry. Success brought with it a significant problem, however: Takada shipments increasingly drew the attention of pirates. Instead of relying on mainstream weapons for defence, Ronan Takada tasked engineers with developing concepts for personal laser weapons. The prototypes debuted to mass defence industry acclaim, resulting in the Takada corporation's bold decision to recruit and train its own security force as well.^[3]^
