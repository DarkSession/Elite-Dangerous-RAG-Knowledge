# Acronyms & Slang
Below is an alphabetical list of **Acronyms & Slang** commonly used among players of *Elite Dangerous*, as well as in-universe terminology with meanings that are not immediately clear to the casual observer.

- **AFMU:** Auto Field-Maintenance Unit.
- **AspX:** Abbreviation of the Asp Explorer.
- **ASPX:** Another, incorrect abbreviation of Asp Explorer. Used by players under the misconception that the word "Asp" is an acronym ("ASP Explorer"); an "asp" is another word for a "viper", following the *Elite* series' trend of naming some ship models after snake species.
- **AX:** Anti-Xeno. Used to refer to any activities or ship builds relating to combat with Thargoids.
- **Allie:** An NPC or player aligned with the Alliance. Pronounced as "all-ee" instead of "ally".
- **Barnacle:** The partially organic resource fabric placed on planet surface by Thargoids. You can gain usual and special resources from there via your SRV.
- **Basking:** Refers to the sensation of awe or enjoyment some players feel in locations that are especially visually impressive. Also refers to an opportunity to take an interesting screenshot, often with the player's ship as a main focus. The term originated from phrases painted outside the Access Corridors of Imperial-controlled stations: "Hail the Emperor - Bask in His Greatness" (this was updated to "Bask in Her Glory" after Emperor Hengist Duval was succeeded by Arissa Lavigny-Duval).
- **BGS**: Background simulation, the influence to galactic processes from player's actions. This means your decisions may change states of Minor factions in affected systems, cause some fluctuations in the Commodity market...
- **Big Blue Beluga:** A term used when one comes across an invincible, Elite NPC flying a Beluga Liner with a vibrant blue paint job with unlimited health will interdict and destroy an unsuspecting player for an unknown reason. Only a small amount of encounters have been reported and the so-called "Big Blue Beluga" phenomenon is very likely to be a bug in the game.
- **Board Flipping:** The obsolete practice of switching between Open/Private Group/Solo modes to force mission boards to refresh and present new missions, usually done to stack multiple missions of the same type to maximize convenience and profitability. While viewed with distaste by a segment of the community, Frontier Developments confirmed that Board Flipping was not an exploit or violation of the game's Terms of Service. Board Flipping was effectively neutralised with update 3.3, which implemented a dedicated server for missions that made missions consistent across all game modes.
- **Boiling:** Silent Running near a star or a station orbiting close to a star.

- **Carebear:** A player who plays in Open, but believes that other players have no right to interfere with them regardless of the circumstances. Carebears complain at length whenever their ship is destroyed by another player despite Open's primary purpose being to facilitate PvP activity, and ship destruction at the hands of another player being a well-recognized risk of playing in Open. They also often demand that Frontier Developments either reimburse them the rebuy fee or fully restore their ship and any cargo in the event they could not afford the rebuy, as well as punish the attacker. Due to this behavior, Carebears are considered an entitled and toxic element of the community. Carebears are not to be confused with victims of Ganking or Griefing, which involves the deliberate and repeated destruction of a player's ship with the intent of provoking an emotional reaction from the victim for the attacker's personal amusement.
- **CG:** Community Goal. Commanders can sign up for missions and community rewards at stations that are hosting a community goal.

Unlike typical "rage-quitting", the goal is generally to avoid a potential loss of one's ship (and any commodities their ship may be carrying) and paying for the rebuy. The practice is viewed with distaste by much of the community and considered an exploit by Frontier Developments, since they forbids workarounds of planned game mechanics .
- **Conda:** Short term for an Anaconda. Not to be confused with the F63 Condor, a ship at the other end of the size spectrum. Build is often tagged on: shieldconda, plasmaconda, cannoconda, etc.

- **Gold Rush:** When a large number of players flock to an area to take advantage of missions that are extremely profitable and also low-risk, fast to complete, or very simple.
