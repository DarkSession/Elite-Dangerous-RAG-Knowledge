## Lore

Soontill Relics are alien artefacts allegedly obtained from a planet in the Soontill system that was discovered after the Thargoids mentioned the location around 3250. Analysis of Soontill Relics has revealed that they could not have been created by any known human technology, yet also do not completely conform with known Thargoid materials. Isotopic dating indicates they are tens of thousands of years old. Some historians have asserted that the relics may originate from an ancient Thargoid subculture.^[1]^ The Dark Wheel is reportedly responsible for both discovering Soontill and selling its relics via Cheranovsky City's market.^[2]^
