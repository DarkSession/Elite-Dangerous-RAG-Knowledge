## History

Beta Hydri was first colonised between 2190 and 2230.^[1]^ Alongside Sol, Tau Ceti, Delta Pavonis, and Altair, it was one of the original signatories of the Federal Accord of 2242 and is regarded as a founding member of the Federation.

In 2325, following an unexpected loss against the upstart Empire in the pivotal Battle of Achenar, Federal forces were harried by the Imperial "People's Fleet" from Achenar to Beta Hydri, where the Imperial advance was finally halted. The stalemate between the Federation and Empire over the system persisted until 2381, when Sirius Corporation mediated a peace treaty between the two superpowers.

Centuries later, the system became known for Ziva Eschel, a bounty hunter of some repute. In the 34th century, Beta Hydri remains one of the Federation's most important systems.
