# Double Shot Weapon
**Double Shot Weapon** is an engineer modification that can be applied to Fragment Cannons. It allows the weapon to fire twice before reloading, and provides additional benefits to rate of fire and increased clip size, at the cost of decreased range.

It is available in 5 grades, all of which allow for a double shot, but with the highest grade also offering up to 100% increase in ammo clip size.
