## Usage

The Arc Cutter can be used to cut open objects such as Maintenance Panels, which can hide Components or protect nodes that can be overcharged or drained with the Energylink, and Maglocks, which seal lockers, containers, and large maintenance panels that may be holding various Components and Goods. The Arc Cutter is often *required* to complete certain Salvage or Recovery missions on planets, as the mission objective may be secured behind a maintenance panel.

Note that the Arc Cutter has a minimum range; standing too close to the cutting target will prevent it from working. Care should also be taken not to move too fast, or else the beam may 'skip' over portions and require going back to complete the cut.
