**NGC 281** is a nebula in Elysian Shore. It is a cosmic cloud of gas in the Cassiopeia constellation next to the bright star Shedar. The nebula was discovered by the pioneering astrophotographer E.E. Barnard in 1883. 

It is informally called the Pacman nebula, because its shape resembles the 1980s arcade game character.
