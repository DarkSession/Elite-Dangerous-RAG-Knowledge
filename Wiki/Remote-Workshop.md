# Remote Workshop
Remote Workshop in the Starport Services menu
 		 	 

The **Remote Workshop** is a service available at any station or Drake-Class Carrier. Pilots can access it to apply any single Engineering modification to a module provided that they have pinned the blueprint while at an Engineer's workshop. One blueprint can be pinned per Engineer. "Legacy" modifications produced before the addition of Remote Workshops cannot be converted to standard. Modifications created through the Remote Workshop do not count towards the relevant Engineer's reputation, and Experimental Effects cannot be applied.

## Notes

- The Remote Workshop was added in *Elite Dangerous: Beyond* Chapter One (3.0).
