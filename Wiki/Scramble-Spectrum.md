# Scramble Spectrum
Scramble Spectrum on G5 Overcharged Pulse Lasers
 		 	 

**Scramble Spectrum** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to weapons through Engineering. It is an experimental upgrade that allows hull strikes to potentially trigger random module malfunctions on the target, temporarily disabling one of their systems, at the cost of a slightly reduced rate of fire and subsequent loss of sustained damage output.

Scramble Spectrum also alters the weapon's visual effects to a green-hued, unstable beam that causes electrical discharges at the point of impact, though custom Weapon Colours will override most of these effects.

## Applicability

This effect is available to the following weapons:

- Burst Laser
- Pulse Laser

## Materials Required

- 5x Crystal Shards
- 3x Untypical Shield Scans
- 5x Exceptional Scrambled Emission Data
