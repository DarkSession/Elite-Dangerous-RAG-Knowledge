Inside a Concourse
 		 	 

The **Concourse** is a public area with vendors and services in a Station, Surface Port, Megaship, or Fleet Carrier.

Commanders can socialize, take on missions, acquire personal equipment (e.g. weapons and suits), exchange or sell Components and Goods, or simply relax at the bar, watch ships arrive and depart.^[1]^ The Concourse is accessible from a hangar via the express lift.

## Types

 	 	[![Concourse view alpha](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/a/a8/Concourse_view_alpha.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20210402025654)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/a/a8/Concourse_view_alpha.png/revision/latest?cb=20210402025654)

There are three distinct types of Concourses. Each correspond to the port type. For example, the system Ross 263, Doi City and Volta Gateway have Spaceport Concourses. Buffett Hub, Coats Terminal, and Fulton Station have Outpost Concourses. Neumann Survey and Vardeman Observatory have Planetports. Not all facilities in the galaxy are big enough to support a Concourse. 

Concourse layouts are broadly similar, but vary in some details, including lighting and decorations, depending on the type of port, local economy and power who controls it. A prison colony is notably different from an agricultural hub.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Fleet Carrier | Fleet Carriers also have a Concourse. When a Fleet Carrier undertakes a hyperspace jump, the disembarked pilots aboard can watch the jump via the windows in the Concourse. Players are escorted to a seat in the command deck shortly before a hyperspace jump. You cannot leave the seat until the jump has been completed. |
| Outpost | These are in Asteroid Bases and orbital Outposts. |
| Planetary port | These are in Planetary Ports and have a view of the planetary surface. |
| Spaceport | These are found in a starport: Coriolis, Ocellus, and Orbis. |

## Vendors and Services

Concourses provide access to the following vendors and services. Available services on Fleet Carrier Concourses may vary depending on which service modules the owner has installed.^[2]^

### Apex Interstellar Transport

 	 	[![Apex Interstellar Transport ED 1](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/b2/Apex_Interstellar_Transport_ED_1.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20241226224328)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/b/b2/Apex_Interstellar_Transport_ED_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20241226224328) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Apex Interstellar Transport in a Concourse
 		 	 

Apex Interstellar Transport is a shuttle service that commanders can use to travel to other locations without needing to use a personal ship. Commanders simply pay to book a flight to the destination of their choice, either local or in another system, then take a lift to Apex's shuttle hangar, board the Apex Adder shuttle, and settle in for the ride. Apex shuttles can be booked both at a Concourse and at settlements.

Apex Interstellar Transport is not available in Fleet Carrier Concourses.

### Frontline Solutions

 	 	[![Frontline Solutions Concourse](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/0/08/Frontline_Solutions_Concourse.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20241228192221)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/0/08/Frontline_Solutions_Concourse.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20241228192221) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Frontline Solutions

 	 	[![ED Odyssey Pioneer Supplies Remlok](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/c/ca/ED_Odyssey_Pioneer_Supplies_Remlok.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220811212418)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/c/ca/ED_Odyssey_Pioneer_Supplies_Remlok.png/revision/latest?cb=20220811212418) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Pioneer Supplies store
 		 	 

Pioneer Supplies is a general store that offers a wide selection personal weapons, suits, and consumable items for purchase. Vendors will also buy any extra items from commanders, but for less than they sell them. Pioneer Supplies locations have a chance of stocking pre-Engineered items when they refresh their inventories each week.

All Concourses include Suit Recharge Sockets for public use. People wear magnetic boots due to low or no gravity in the Concourse.^[3]^

### The Lounge

 	 	[![Concourse Lounge Bar ED](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/79/Concourse_Lounge_Bar_ED.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20241228193327)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/79/Concourse_Lounge_Bar_ED.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20241228193327) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
The Lounge
 		 	 

The Lounge (aka Concourse Bar), is an area where commanders can meet, socialize, and take in the views of the local port. The Bartender can exchange Components and pay credits for Goods and a black market.

The bar features a selection of over 800 music tracks that are played in the background.^[4]^

### Vista Genomics

 	 	[![ED-Vista-Genomics](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/7f/ED-Vista-Genomics.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20220812161943)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/7f/ED-Vista-Genomics.png/revision/latest?cb=20220812161943) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Vista Genomics
 		 	 

Vista Genomics is an exobiology company that will buy the genetic information of alien life forms discovered by commanders and collected with the Genetic Sampler.

### Mission Providers

 	 	[![Mission Provider Concourse](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/2/2d/Mission_Provider_Concourse.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20241230131306)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/2/2d/Mission_Provider_Concourse.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20241230131306) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Mission Provider
 		 	 

Mission Providers are minor faction representatives who are seeking to hire commanders for lucrative off-the-books missions. In contrast with accepting a mission through a Mission Board, commanders can negotiate with Mission Providers to try and coax greater rewards from them for successfully completing a mission based on their Mercenary rank. If a negotiation fails, the commander will have no choice but to accept the default reward if they agree to the mission's terms. 

**Note**: missions that are taken from a standing Mission Provider must be turned in at that specific Mission Provider.^[5]^ Mission Providers are unavailable in Fleet Carrier Concourses.

### Terminals

 	 	[![Concourse Terminal ED](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/9/9c/Concourse_Terminal_ED.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20241228203334)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/9/9c/Concourse_Terminal_ED.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20241228203334) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Terminal
 		 	 

Terminals are interactive kiosks that provide access to the local Mission Board, a record of completed missions, the commander's Loadout menu, local Contacts, Holo-Me, the Store, and Local News. They also display the commander's current Credit and ARX balances, and their reputation with the port's controlling minor faction.

### Escape Pods

 	 	[![Concourse Escape Pods](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/8/89/Concourse_Escape_Pods.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20250101144358)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/8/89/Concourse_Escape_Pods.png/revision/latest?cb=20250101144358) 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Escape Pods on a Megaship
 		 	 

Escape Pods are located in Concourses aboard Flight Operations Carrier Megaships, and Fleet Carriers^[6]^. Players can use an Escape Pod to directly enter Redeployment if: you're trapped aboard a Megaship or Carrier because it jumped to a new location, your personal ship was docked elsewhere and out of range of Apex Interstellar Transport shuttles, or you cannot purchase a new ship due to insufficient funds or the absence of an Inter Astra vendor.

## Persistence

Concourses are generated as part of normal instances in the game. Players flying ships in a starport docking bay or outside an outpost can view players and NPCs inside a Concourse through its windows, and vice-versa.

Players without *Odyssey* cannot see through windows into a Concourse. They merely see a bright light.

## Development

Concourses were introduced as a core feature in *ED: Odyssey*.^[7]^ Concourses were added to all Flight Operations Carrier Megaships, excluding Rescue Vessels, in *Odyssey* Update 8.^[8]^^[9]^ Concourses were added to Fleet Carriers in *Odyssey* Update 11.^[2]^
