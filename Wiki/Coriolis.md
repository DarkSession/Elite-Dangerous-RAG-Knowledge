Coriolis
 		 	 

The **Coriolis** starport is a time-tested station design (in the shape of a cuboctahedron) pioneered by the Galactic Cooperative and regarded as its most prolific and enduring legacy. Renowned for its efficient, modular layout, a single Coriolis can be assembled and made operational within a matter of weeks. These stations are usually the first to be built in newly-colonized systems, and are converted into trading posts once the initial phase of colonization is completed.^[1]^

## Overview

Modern Coriolis stations are cuboctahedrons with a 2-kilometer diameter. When it was first introduced by GalCop, the design had a much smaller diameter of 1 kilometer, but beginning in the 3200's the size was increased. By the 3300's, although new Coriolis stations continue to be built both within the Core Systems and out in the frontiers of the Colonia Region and Pleiades Nebula, maintaining them has become more costly as parts have become more difficult to procure or manufacture.^[1]^

The exterior of the Coriolis consists of inverted skyscrapers, where penthouses provide spectacular views of space in addition to comfortable levels of gravity. In rare cases, a Coriolis will also feature two "arms" extending from opposite facets of the main structure, as seen with Smith Reserve in LDS 883. A second variant with four "arms" was introduced with Cavalieri in Electra.

The independent construction company Steel Castle Inc is known to specialise in modifying Coriolis stations, and in September 3306 it began a campaign to upgrade a number of refinery outposts into Coriolis models at the request of Brewer Corporation.^[2]^

### Docking

    - *Main article: Docking*

Due to the symmetrical nature of Coriolis stations it can be difficult to find the docking slot. To remedy this the target hologram displayed when targeting the station has arrows pointing towards the station's entrance. It is possible to line up the approach vector with the front of the station while in supercruise using the hologram to gauge position, allowing a pilot to drop from supercruise facing the station's entrance.

Aside from the hologram, an alternative method of locating the entrance is to observe the starport's axis of rotation after arriving. The entrance will always be located at the end of the axis of rotation that spins counter-clockwise when you are facing the starport. In addition, the rear of the station has red lights in the corners, while the front is lit by green lights.

## Colonisation

Coriolis Stations are a Tier 2 station and can be selected as the starting build in the Primary Port location. The cost to build a Coriolis station will be the same if no matter if the selection is 0 truss, 2 truss, or 4 truss. 

The approximate cost in resources for a Coriolis built as a Primary Port with the 30% increase will be between 69,000 and 75,000 tons total. And a player will have 4 weeks to deliver all needed material or they will forfeit the claim.

To build a Coriolis in an established system the base requirement is 3 Tier 2 construction points. The station will require between 53,000 and 58,000 resources but established systems no longer have the 4 week time limit.

The games BGS system will adjust the cost of each resource by up to **Â±5%** of the listed cost based off of calculations made when the construction site is placed.
