Solar eclipse and Anaconda
 		 	 

A **solar eclipse** occurs when a planet, moon, or asteroid passes between the observer and a star. The star is fully or partially covered, with the duration of the eclipse dependent on the object's orbital path and distance from the star. Due to the sheer size of the Milky Way galaxy and variations in star system composition, it is possible to encounter an eclipse at any time while traveling the galaxy. Eclipses may be viewed from space or the surface of a landable world.
