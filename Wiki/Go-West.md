DRX presents 'Go West'

## Background

Long Range - Deep Exploration / Survey Mission to explore the Western Rim with an intial destination of the Myoangooe nebula (approximately 44,000 ly from the bubble)

## About

A staggered departure from the Diaguandri system. Initial destination was Jaques Station in the Eol Prou RS-T d3-94 system. Commanders taking part gradually gathered at Jaques over the course of the month of October, ready for the beginning of Bravo Stage.

Beginning on the 26th October, Commanders departed  for the Myoangooe nebula. The destination route was flexible as the aim of Bravo Stage was to have as many DRX commanders heading toward the star Myoangooe TJ-R c20-1 as possible. Different routes were encouraged. 

From the 12 to the 20th November, a recon of the Myoangooe Nebula took place with Cmdrs Dell Tarrant and JT442 first on site. New geysers were discovered and much larking-around took place. At this point, it was the longest-range DRX mission carried out and the first to leave from the newly re-discovered Jaques Station.
