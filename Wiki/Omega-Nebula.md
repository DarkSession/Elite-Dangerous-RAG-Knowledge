## History

The Asteroid Base Omega Mining Operation opened in the system Omega Sector VE-Q b5-15 on April 11, 3303, part of a wave of Asteroid Bases constructed in deep space nebulae across the galaxy. Omega Mining Operation served as a hub for explorers and travelers bound for Colonia on the Colonia Connection Highway.

During the Distant Worlds II expedition, Omega Sector VE-Q b5-15 was designated the second waypoint of the journey. Starting on January 17, 3305, Omega Mining Operation hosted a successful initiative on Distant Worlds II's behalf to mine resources to be used in the construction of Explorer's Anchorage, an Ocellus Starport that would be located in Stuemeae FG-Y d7561, near Sagittarius A\*.^[1]^^[2]^ Due to the massive influx of independent pilots in the Omega Nebula during the campaign, the Detention Centre Rock of Isolation was permanently stationed in Omega Sector OD-S b4-0 to handle the heightened crime rate.

## List of inhabited systems

As of January 17, 3305, the Omega Nebula contains 2 inhabited systems with 2 ports, and has a total population of 15,000.
