**Stuemeae FG-Y d7561** is a system in the Galactic Centre that is approximately 25,899 ly away from Sol. It has the distinction of being the closest system with an Earth-like World to Sagittarius A\*, the center of the Milky Way galaxy, and is also the furthest populated system from Sol.

On January 24, 3305, Stuemeae FG-Y d7561 was announced as the future site of a Starport that would be constructed by the Distant Worlds II expedition and dedicated to the study of the Sagittarius A\* supermassive black hole.^[1]^^[2]^^[3]^ The result of that endeavor was Explorer's Anchorage, which began operation on February 21, 3305 and became the most distant station from Sol, the closest station to Sagittarius A\*, and the closest station to Beagle Point.
