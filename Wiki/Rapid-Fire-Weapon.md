# Rapid Fire Weapon
**Rapid Fire Weapon** is an engineer modification that can be applied to weapons. It increases a weapon's rate of fire and decreases its reload time, but this comes at the cost of increased jitter and reduced damage per shot.

It is available in 5 grades. Note the variations in values for certain types of weapons in the tables below, primarily Burst Lasers.
