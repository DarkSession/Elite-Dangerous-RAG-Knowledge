The **Prospector Limpet Controller** is a type of Limpet Controller module that can program limpets to scan asteroids and determine their composition. The composition of the asteroid, which consists of either two or three different resources, and the amount of resources remaining can be seen by targeting the limpet attached to that asteroid. While using a Prospector Limpet is not required to mine an asteroid, the data provided allows more resources to be extracted.

## Usage

 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			
Prospector drone
 		 	 

Prospector drones will increase the quantity of fragments that can be obtained from an asteroid, with the magnitude of this effect dependent on their letter rating (notably not class); with A-rating being the strongest, as expected. An A-rated Prospector Controller of any number class (1, 3, 5, 7) has the same increase to fragment yield. This effect is not applied retroactively. For example: if an asteroid can produce 10 fragments normally and it is prospected from the start, it will now yield 20 fragments. If that same asteroid was mined for 5 fragments before using a prospector, the remaining 5 possible fragments will be doubled to yield 10 fragments for a total yield of 15 fragments. In general, a prospected asteroid will yield anywhere from 20 to 40+ fragments, a considerable difference from the yield without a drone.

A resultant technique involves chipping off a single fragment from an asteroid to determine its composition without using a prospector drone and then mining the rest of the asteroid with a prospector drone attached. This allows you to save limpet drones for only the asteroids you want to mine while only losing one fragment per asteroid. Bear in mind that a fragment can only contain a maximum of two resources while asteroids can contain up to three, so the first fragment may not tell you all of the resources the asteroid contains.

In the new Analysis Mode, if a Commander fires a Prospecting Limpet at an asteroid, you will be able to see the highlighted location of all the deposits on it, making it easy for you to target and exploit those specific areas.^[1]^
