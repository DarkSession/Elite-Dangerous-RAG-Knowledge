Alliance Assembly Councillor (formerly)

**Quinn Damico** was a Councillor of the Alliance Assembly who represented the Aranbarahun system in 3304, during a period when the system was a member of the Alliance. That year, he spoke out against the abuse and persecution of members of the Thargoid-worshipping Far God cult in Aranbarahun and elsewhere, noting that the fringe religion was nonviolent and protected by religious freedom laws in all systems where it had established a presence.

## Timeline

26 JUL 3304

- The Church of Eternal Void, a fringe group that venerates the Guardians, has been declared illegal in every system where it operates. Cardinal Hieronymous and other senior members of the Church have been arrested for inciting acts of violence against the so-called 'Far God' sect, which worships the Thargoids. The death toll among the Far God sect is now in the hundreds, with many more injured. Councillor Quinn Damico praised the declaration: "All citizens have the freedom to practise any religion they choose, provided that religion does not sanction homicide. Authorities have made the right move to prevent further bloodshed." The decision was condemned by Juanita Bishop, who runs a campaign against the Far God sect: "So the sick Thargoid-lovers can walk free, while those with the courage to oppose them are put behind bars. It's the traitors who worship the enemy that should be illegal! This perversion of justice will backfire on us, mark my words." Dr Jameelah Griffin of the Galactic Interfaith Commune made this statement: "The ability to distinguish between laws and beliefs is the mark of a civilised society. In this case we consider the Far God sect to be the victim rather than the aggressor, despite the controversial nature of their faith."^[1]^

19 JUL 3304

- There has been a spate of violence against the Thargoid-worshipping Far God cult, resulting in dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries. Since the Church of Eternal Void declared war against the sect, its members have compelled citizens to attack Far God believers in many systems. Several of the sect's places of worship have been firebombed. The Far God cultists have offered no resistance to the aggression, and have even refused to leave burning hive-chapels. Cardinal Hieronymous, representing the Church of Eternal Void, addressed a large crowd: "Our loyal followers are performing the Guardians' righteous work! Those who serve the Thargoid demons are demons themselves, and we must cast them out with fire and fury." A vocal campaigner against the Far God sect, Juanita Bishop, told the media: "It might not be pretty, but what's happening now is no different to what our brave pilots are doing out there in space â€“ defending their own kind. We will do whatever it takes to protect our children from these monsters." Local security forces have been slow to respond to the incidents, and few arrests have been made. Councillor Quinn Damico commented: "The lack of an immediate clampdown is inexcusable. The Church is inciting criminal acts and persecuting a legally registered religion. I call upon the authorities to bring the full force of the law against any vigilante behaviour."^[2]^

- Public reaction to a fringe religion that worships the Thargoids is one of mistrust and hostility, according to security reports. The nameless cult believes in the coming of the so-called Far God and the subsequent extinction of all humanity bar themselves. Their hive-chapels, inspired by Thargoid design, have sprung up on several independent worlds and in a few Federation and Alliance systems. Security forces in these locations have made numerous arrests for misdemeanours directed at the sect. These include graffiti, property damage, verbal abuse and physical assault. There are no recorded cases of worshippers retaliating, defending themselves or seeking assistance. Juanita Bishop, who runs a vocal citizen-protection campaign, claims she is warning the public about a genuine danger: "If these Thargoid lovers don't want to be human anymore, they shouldn't be allowed to live among other humans! Our governments should pack these foul-smelling freaks into ships and send them off to join the aliens they love so much. And if they don't, it's up to us to stop them. Do you really want these degenerates to creep into your home at night and do obscene alien things to your family?" Many authorities have responded along the same lines as Councillor Quinn Damico of the Aranbarahun system: "I would like to assure citizens that the Far God worshippers, while strange, are essentially harmless. Furthermore, criminal acts against them, including incitement to violence, may result in prosecution. The right to freedom of religion is protected by law in all systems where the sect has a presence."^[3]^
