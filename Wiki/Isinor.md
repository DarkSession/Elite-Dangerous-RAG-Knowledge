**Isinor** is an independent system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. The system is permit-locked, and the permit can be obtained by becoming Allied with the Chapter of Isinor minor faction in any system where it has a presence. A persistent Convoy Beacon with salvageable Antiquities can be found orbiting the Earth-like World of Maodun.

The Chapter of Isinor faction was one of 14 permit-holding factions that entered into an agreement on November 24, 3307 to maintain so-called Gatekeeper megaships to preserve interstellar trade regardless of local political shifts. These Gatekeeper megaships would be permanently stationed in systems adjacent to their corresponding permit-locked systems to ensure that pilots could reliably obtain permits. Chariot of the Faithful was deployed in HR 4803 as the Chapter of Isinor's Gatekeeper megaship.^[1]^
