Further Stories Of Life On The Frontier
 		 	 

After the success of the fiction in Frontier: Elite II, Frontier: First Encounters came with a new collection of short stories;Â *Further Stories Of Life On The Frontier*, written by Manda Scott, S.L.A.M., Julian Flood, Martyn Taylor, Moira Sheehan, Jude Jones and Kathy Braben. For whatever reason, only four of these stories can be considered as being set in the Elite/Frontier Universe; the rest are just general science fiction.^[1]^

There's the continuing hostilities between the Federation and Empire, muddied by the recently formed Alliance, and an intriguing story involving the Sirius Corporation and another which touches on the growing discomfort regarding the INRA actions towards the Thargoids. The attempted assassination of the Emperor has an intriguing ending, and Elaine Meyer embarks on a stealth mission to recover a very unusual ship.^[1]^
