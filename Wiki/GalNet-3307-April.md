### Empire Attacks Neo-Marlinist Faction

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Conflict has erupted between the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group and the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid.

An investigation by ACT in the Mudhrid system confirmed that the Order of Mudhrid provided logistical support for the NMLA’s starport attacks. Their agents infiltrated other local factions to transport enzyme bombs to their targets.

The faction has now renamed itself the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid. Landgrave Arastin Delacroix, its leader, has declared a revolution against the Imperial Family. From his flagship, the Steel Majesty, he announced:

“The corrupt Duvals will never give up their power, so we must take it from them. All those who seek to change the established order – join us!”

The Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group responded by engaging their forces in battle. Senator Denton Patreus has ordered them to “take revenge for the ‘Nine Martyrs’ atrocities.”

This is the first instance of a faction openly adopting Neo-Marlinism, although it has not been officially recognised by the Marlinist Colonies. Minister Aaron Whyte commented:

“It’s a lost opportunity that Landgrave Delacroix chose to aid extremists, rather than provide a political platform to the Neo-Marlinist community. I hope we can soon replace the cycle of violence with meaningful communication.”

### Galactic Mysteries: Generation Ships

Erik Gunnarson and Francesca Wolfe investigate the abandoned relics of spacefaring communities from the early years of colonisation.

Wolfe: “Generation ships are essentially mobile cities designed to carry expanding populations, and are always an impressive sight. But there’s one I keep returning to – the Thetis, orbiting Nefertem 6 a.”

“Listening to its logs always chills my blood. They describe how a whispered phrase from an uninhabited planet somehow caused over 17,000 people to slaughter each other. Nobody knows if it was mass hysteria, psychological stress from decades in space, or… something else.”

“So many visits to the Thetis, and I still can’t work up the nerve to play its final log entry. I’ve been warned that I won’t be the same afterwards.”

Gunnarson: “Before hyperdrives, generation ships were a viable way to colonise distant star systems. Millions of people lived out their whole lives within self-contained societies, so their descendants might walk upon new worlds.”

“The tragedy is that many of these pioneering megaships vanished entirely, never reaching their destinations. But some were rediscovered, usually because of listening posts intercepting their ancient broadcasts.”

“There are various reasons why these expeditions failed. The Lazarus, now orbiting Virudnir 6, suffered mechanical breakdowns whereas the Pleione, in the Hez Ur system, had a population that only produced male babies.”

“Most disturbing are those where the crew descended into barbarism, like the Artemis at Mu Cassiopeia C 1 and the Demeter in the Mizuchi system. Along with Wolfe’s favourite – if that’s the right word – these stand as horrific monuments to our darker natures.”

“Lost generation ships rarely carry survivors, but that was the case with the Golconda, whose people now occupy an outpost on Upaniklis B 3. So perhaps more living relics are still adrift in the void, waiting to complete centuries-long missions.”

## 05 APR

### The Wedding of Hadrian Duval

Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval, leader of the isolationist group Nova Imperium, has married his consort Astrid Minerva in a closed ceremony.

Commander Minerva was a young Imperial pilot who aided Nova Imperium at the Battle of Paresa in 3305 and became a loyal supporter. Her official title is now Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval.

Princess Aisling Duval personally attended her cousin’s wedding at a secure location. She referred to it as “a precious moment of joy in these bleak times”.

The Imperial Palace and the Senate have sent congratulatory messages, and the event was covered by mainstream media.

Paresa News Network: “Astrid’s well-deserved rise to nobility has made her fellow Paresans very proud. Everyone at PNN is overjoyed for the happy couple!”

Eye on Achenar: “It’s an insult to the noble Duval bloodline when some trigger-jockey from a gutter system can sink her claws into the Emperor’s own nephew.”

The Imperial Herald: “Hadrian taking a bride at the age of 20 has surprised many. If he becomes the only Duval to produce heirs, it will place pressure on Emperor Arissa and Princess Aisling, neither of whom have consorts.”

In related news, Nova Imperium vessels are participating in the current conflict against the Neo-Marlinists of Mudhrid. Praetor Leo Magnus, head of security, is liaising with the IISS on anti-terrorism intelligence.

## 06 APR

### Federation Begins Anti-Terrorist Monitoring

The Proactive Detection Bureau has been set up by the Federal Intelligence Agency to scan civilian communications for signs of terrorist activity.

The new department was formed following congressional approval of the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act. This was drafted by Vice President Jerome Archer, who told the media:

“The PDB is a vital tool to prevent further massacres on the scale we have recently witnessed. It will unearth NMLA terrorists and other dangerous activists concealed among innocent citizens, and help keep our families safe.”

Deputy Director Bethany Blake, who has been appointed to run the Proactive Detection Bureau, explained its operations:

“Highly advanced algorithms will scan all data transmitted across public and private networks on a system-wide level. Any suspicious communications are redirected to a regional hub, for review by trained investigators.”

“It is important to understand that only specific activity within narrow parameters will be flagged, and must pass dozens of automated checkpoints before our operatives can access it.”

Shadow President Winters and civil rights groups have protested that this violates long-standing privacy laws. However, President Hudson has championed the PDB as a cornerstone of the new counter-terrorism statutes.

## 08 APR

### Neo-Marlinist Faction Defeated in Battle

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The Mudhrid system conflict has ended with the Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group overcoming the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid.

This was triggered by ACT discovering that the Neo-Marlinist faction had provided transports and logistical support for the NMLA’s attacks against nine starports.

The Epsilon Fornacis Empire Group has thanked all pilots who contributed to its triumph. Rewards are now available at Payne-Scott City in the Mudhrid system.

Landgrave Arastin Delacroix, ruler of the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, has so far evaded capture. He managed to broadcast this message:

“Those brave warriors who fought for our cause can receive recompense at the Steel Majesty. One day we will slay the Duvals and bring revolution to the Empire!”

Inspector Mara Klatt of ACT told the media:

“This is a definite victory against the NMLA. It also provides an insight into their modus operandi – promising disenfranchised or delusional leaders, such as Landgrave Delacroix, increased status in the new Republic should they succeed. We assume they used similar third parties to support the Alliance and Federation bombings.”

“Our agents are gathering information, but it’s clear that the NMLA’s network is more advanced and widespread than we first suspected.”

### The Awakening of the Adamastor

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The Adamastor, a 200 year old ‘ghost ship’ in orbit around Chukchan 5 b, has received a mysterious encrypted signal. The derelict vessel has been undergoing investigation by Alliance Salvage Guild teams since its discovery last October. They released this report:

“Months ago, we cut open one of the Adamastor’s damaged cargo holds to find an undeployed communications beacon. We managed to power it up, but it contained no data and had never been used.”

“This beacon has now automatically activated, and is receiving and rebroadcasting a long-range signal. The transmission’s source cannot be identified, but is definitely of interstellar origin. Its encoded content has yet to be deciphered.”

The Adamastor vanished in 3111 after an incident that may have involved the first historical encounter with the Thargoids. It reappeared in 3306 when it entered the Chukchan system at sublight speeds on autopilot, with no sign of its crew.

It was recently learned that in 3113 the Adamastor’s sister ship, the Hesperus, also disappeared. Both were owned by a corporation called Azimuth Biochemicals, which was absorbed by a rival named Pharmasapien. Little is known about either company, but it is believed they were competitors in the field of xenological research.

## 09 APR

### Imperial Senator Visits Marlinist Colonies

Senator Lorcan Scordato has visited the Marlinist Colonies on a fact-finding mission as part of the Empire’s anti-terrorism operations.

The Imperial Herald was permitted to publish this summary of his preliminary report:

“Considering their recent refugee status, the Marlinist communities are remarkably well-organised. Their government works along republican lines but they have not abandoned Imperial culture, with many feeling homesick for their original worlds.”

“However, their situation remains precarious, with three of their eight systems now under the control of external factions. Without increased support from the galactic community, further losses may be unavoidable.”

“Regarding the NMLA, there is widespread anger that they have made all Marlinists look like monsters. Only rarely did I sense guarded approval, with the vast majority openly condemning the terrorists.”

“The Marlinist Parliament is small but efficient, containing a spectrum of viewpoints. First Minister Fairfax is focused on cohesion and survival, Amrita Ross discussed future reintegration with the Empire, while Aaron Whyte sees Neo-Marlinism as a valid political movement if violence can be avoided.”

“Months ago these were ordinary Imperial citizens, and our shared history still binds us. Generally, I feel that the Marlinist Colonies are closer to allies than enemies in our war against the NMLA.”

## 12 APR

### Galactic Mysteries: Dredger Clans

Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency discusses the nomadic tribes that wander the galaxy in converted dredger megaships.

“It’s well known that there are many travelling communities – groups of people who prefer to live on the move rather than settle anywhere. Proudly independent, they survive on the fringes of civilisation and tend to avoid interacting with the authorities. Those commonly known as the Dredger Clans are among the most successful.”

“Dredger-class bulk cruisers convert both natural and man-made minerals into raw resources, to sustain themselves on deep-space voyages. Improved hyperdrives and fuel-scooping systems made this design redundant long ago, but some were taken over by nomads and kept operational.”

“These dredgers are now a type of generation ship. Each hosts tens of thousands of people, whose cultures have evolved – or devolved – over decades or centuries. Some are true loners while others have formed alliances, or occasionally gather to increase their gene pools.”

“Typically these clans act as scavengers, quickly passing through systems to steal anything not locked down. Several take what they need in more aggressive ways, such as raiding unprotected outposts.”

“A few have even darker reputations. I remember being told as a boy: ‘If you don’t behave, the Phagos take you away in your sleep and eat you up.’ All my childhood nightmares came surging back when I discovered there may be some truth to that story.”

“More recently, I’ve heard rumours that a rarely seen Dredger Clan has resurfaced. Naturally, Wolfe has rushed off to find out more. Hopefully she’ll be able to increase our limited knowledge of these mysterious tribes.”

## 13 APR

### Federal Reactions to Communications Surveillance Programme

There have been mixed responses to the Proactive Detection Bureau, which monitors private communications in the Federation for terrorist activity.

Mainstream newsfeeds reported on the situation:

The Federal Times: “Civil rights groups are united in protest against the PDB. The controversy was also seized upon by the corporatist movement that was formed by Jupiter Division supporters. Their spokesperson stated: ‘The government has overstepped its authority and must be replaced by direct corporate rule.’”

Sol Today: “Has everyone already forgotten Li Qing Jao station burning in the night skies above Earth? Whatever it takes to keep us safe must be done. Only people with something to hide demand secrecy.”

Vox Galactica: “Professor Irene Ralston of Olympus Village University told us that her political history students received visits by FIA agents for researching Marlinism, despite it being on the curriculum.”

The Tau Ceti Journal: “Corporations that incurred financial losses in the bombings have welcomed the PDB. But other businesses have submitted legal challenges, claiming a right to protect sensitive commercial information. Megacorps such as Caine Massey and Vandermeer are even threatening to withdraw political donations.”

## 15 APR

### Archon Delaine Campaign to Build New Starports

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

The Kumo Crew syndicate has launched an initiative to construct up to five starports to stimulate galactic trade.

Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd, an independent construction company, has been privately contracted by the Kumo Council to build fully operational Orbis stations. These will be located in uninhabited systems close to key trading regions and areas of commercial interest.

The Pegasi Sentinel newsfeed featured this statement from Archon Delaine:

“As sovereign ruler of the Kumo nation, it’s my responsibility to increase prosperity for the systems under my protection. My new starports will extend our reach and boost trading of all kinds… legitimate and otherwise.”

“I have also placed bounties on the heads of anyone who dares to interfere with my plans. The one thing we never trade in is mercy.”

The Razor Whips, one of Delaine’s loyal factions, is organising the campaign. It will reimburse pilots who deliver ceramic composites, semiconductors, polymers and water purifiers to Gabriel Enterprise in the Harma system.

The number of new starports will depend on the quantity of deliveries. The targeted locations are:

Pegasi sector PN-T C3-14, near the Harma system

HIP 18390, near the California Nebula

HIP 10792, near the Sothis system

HIP 62154, in the Coalsack Nebula

Eol Prou PC-K c9-91, in the Colonia region

## 16 APR

### Neo-Marlinists Seek Sanctuary at Marlinist Colonies

Survivors from the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid have arrived in the Marlinist Colonies, requesting political asylum from the Empire.

The faction was recently defeated by Imperial forces in the Mudhrid system, after an ACT investigation confirmed that it provided logistical support for the NMLA attacks on starports.

Landgrave Delacroix and his loyalists fled aboard the Steel Majesty megaship to the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system, which is controlled by the Marlinism Reformation Party. Minister Aaron Whyte, its elected leader, announced:

“Not every individual within the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid is an NMLA activist. We have the right to offer asylum to protect innocents from persecution, just as the Federation protected us when we were refugees.”

The Empire has officially demanded that the Neo-Marlinists be apprehended, with Senator Patreus claiming “The Landgrave of Mudhrid is a traitor and a war criminal.”

Both the Alliance and Federation have likewise insisted on their arrest. However, Shadow President Winters reminded Congress that the Marlinist Charter grants their systems the same legal powers of asylum as the Federation.

The Marlinist Parliament has declared an emergency situation. First Minister Fairfax called for a discussion of options, while Ministers Amrita Ross and Tamsin Taylor urged cooperation with the Empire.

## 19 APR

### The Adamastor Enigma

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Commanders have reported receiving anonymous instructions regarding the 200 year old derelict megaship orbiting Chukchan 5 b.

A communications beacon stored onboard the Adamastor began receiving and rebroadcasting an encrypted signal on the 8th of April. Efforts by authorities to trace and decipher the signal proved unsuccessful.

However, a number of independent pilots claim to have been contacted by an anonymous source, who provided an access key to decode the Adamastor signal.

Commander Rex Trevelyan gave this statement to Vox Galactica:

“Not long after arriving in the Chukchan system, my ship received a message from someone calling himself ‘Salvation’. He provided a decryption key, and when I downloaded the signal from the Adamastor it became readable. It seems to be an automatic SOS from its sister ship, the Hesperus.”

“I’ve heard that some Commanders have made sense of the navigational data in the signal. It feels like pilots are being recruited for something, but who exactly are we working for?”

The Pilots Federation has begun an inquiry into the situation. The identity of ‘Salvation’ remains unknown, but there are reports that the Adamastor signal contains data that has led to its sister ship.

## 20 APR

### Conditional Amnesty Agreed for Neo-Marlinists

The Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid has been granted sanctuary in the Marlinist Colonies in return for revealing the identities of the NMLA’s leaders.

The faction’s survivors arrived in the Hyades Sector RO-P b6-2 system after being defeated by Imperial forces. The Marlinism Reformation Party agreed to offer political asylum, despite all three superpowers demanding the refugees’ arrest.

Imperial Senator Lorcan Scordato, who was visiting the Colonies on a fact-finding mission, announced:

“After meeting the Neo-Marlinists and the Marlinist Parliament, I have secured an agreement. The Landgrave of Mudhrid and his inner circle will cooperate fully with ACT to provide details on the senior leadership of the NMLA. In return, they will receive life imprisonment at a local detention facility.”

“The Steel Majesty’s population will undergo security vetting by the Marlinist Constabulary to identify extremists. The remainder will be permitted to remain in the system and apply for citizenship.”

Chancellor Blaine has approved the proposal, commenting that it was “precisely the sort of creative solution the Emperor requires”. Responses from the Alliance and Federation were mixed, but there was broad agreement that targeting the NMLA was the priority.

Minister Aaron Whyte, elected leader of the Marlinism Reformation Party, publicly thanked Senator Scordato for negotiating a peaceful resolution.

## 21 APR

### Federal Surveillance Identifies Domestic Terrorists

The Proactive Detection Bureau, which monitors all civilian communications in the Federation, has detected several home-grown terrorist groups.

Deputy Director Bethany Blake of the Federal Investigations Agency told the media:

“Our combination of sophisticated algorithms and skilled operatives has unearthed over a dozen extremist organisations, all previously unknown. The FIA launched pre-emptive raids on these groups before they were able to strike against civilian targets.”

“In addition, we have arrested several thousand individuals who were conducting research into terror tactics, radical ideologies and other suspicious subjects.”

“The PDB will continue monitoring all comms networks, and liaising with local security agencies via the Federal Justice Department.”

Vice President Jerome Archer hailed these results as validation of the Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act, and stated that the PDB will help prevent the mass murder of Federal citizens.

Civil rights groups have claimed that these extremists could have been detected via conventional policing methods, rather than intercepting personal messages. Independent criminologists added that the statistical likelihood of such amateur groups committing actual attacks is low.

## 22 APR

### Archon Delaine Starport Campaign Concludes

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

An initiative by the Kumo Crew syndicate to construct new starports for increasing trade has ended successfully.

Pilots delivered large quantities of ceramic composites, semiconductors, polymers and water purifiers to Gabriel Enterprise in the Harma system. Bounty vouchers were also offered to protect the shipments during transit.

The Kumo Council has announced that rewards for both traders and bounty hunters are now available from Gabriel Enterprise via its loyal intermediaries, The Razor Whips.

Kavanagh Spaceframes Ltd will now fulfil its contract and construct new Orbis starports. These will be in place on the 29th of April 3307 at the following locations:

Pegasi sector PN-T C3-14, near the Harma system

HIP 18390, near the California Nebula

HIP 10792, near the Sothis system

HIP 62154, in the Coalsack Nebula

Eol Prou PC-K c9-91, in the Colonia region

A statement from Archon Delaine was published by The Pegasi Sentinel:

“I am pleased to see that our trade routes can now extend into fresh territories. My people will be very grateful, I’m sure.”

“What pleases me less is the huge number of criminal scum that tried to disrupt the project. This has forced me to invent some very creative reprisals, which I look forward to inflicting shortly.”

### Aegis Appeals For Guardian Artefacts

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Ancient objects left behind by the Guardians have been requested by Aegis for a new anti-xeno research programme.

The Guardians were an intelligent humanoid species whose civilisation collapsed over a million years ago, and who were engaged in hostilities with the Thargoid race.

Professor Alba Tesreau, head of Aegis Research, gave this statement:

“At the Galactic Summit, Aegis agreed to undertake a fresh analysis of Guardian technology. The hope is that this will lead to the development of more effective defences against the Thargoids. We therefore require new samples to compare with Ram Tah’s groundbreaking work on this mysterious species.”

“Guardian artefacts including those previously identified as caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns are needed. These can be unearthed from the ancient ruins scattered across dozens of worlds.”

“I beseech the galactic community to support this project. It is vital that Aegis continues to receive funding, and to achieve this we must push the boundaries of our knowledge even further.”

Pilots are asked to deliver their shipments to Aegis Research at the Alexandria megaship in the Delphi system.

## 23 APR

### Winters Claims Civilian Surveillance is Illegal

Shadow President Felicia Winters has claimed that the Proactive Detection Bureau is unconstitutional as it violates the Federal Accord.

In an address before Congress, she said:

“The Federation’s constitution explicitly guarantees citizens the right to data security and privacy. The PDB tramples over this by raiding everyone’s personal communications, casting aside decency and dignity so that algorithms can probe into every aspect of our lives.”

“Furthermore, if ACT’s hypothesis is correct and the NMLA is using an advanced dark-comms network, then the PDB’s existence is baseless and unjustifiable.”

Vice President Jerome Archer responded:

“The Domestic Counter-Terrorism Act is emergency legislation that temporarily suspends constitutional statutes, until we are satisfied that the terrorist threat has been negated.”

“Following the PDB’s success in uncovering extremist groups, we are widening the search parameters to include other related criminal activity.”

Opinion polls suggest that a slim majority of Federal citizens accept that some liberties must be sacrificed in return for increased security.

However, according to the civil rights organisation Advocacy, the speed with which the PDB gained access to data hubs suggested that “The infrastructure was already in place – all the government needed was an opportunity to make it legal.”

## 26 APR

### Neo-Marlinists Expose Hadrian Duval as NMLA Leader

Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval of Nova Imperium is the mastermind behind the NMLA, according to classified information leaked from within ACT.

Independent journalist Flint ‘Firemaker’ Lafosse published the details on the Rewired network:

“Hadrian Duval: the illegitimate embarrassment of the Imperial Family, or their secret terrorist nemesis? That’s the story being told by survivors from the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid, who gave up their secrets to save their own skins.”

“According to my source, Landgrave Delacroix confessed to ACT that his faction transported enzyme bombs and Nova Imperium assassins to their targets on the direct orders of Hadrian Duval, who promised rewards and political power in return.”

“Delacroix also revealed that Hadrian was converted to Neo-Marlinism a year ago by his consort Astrid Minerva, a top NMLA agent. She convinced him that becoming Emperor would be much easier if all the other Duvals were dead!”

“As for the NMLA’s attempt on Hadrian’s life last October, that was faked in order to gain the Imperial Family’s trust. Just another false flag operation – which, as we truth-seekers know, can be found everywhere.”

As yet this information has not been verified, and its source remains anonymous. There has been no comment from either ACT or Nova Imperium.

## 27 APR

### Galactic Mysteries: The Hesperus

Francesca Wolfe of the Wallglass Investigations Agency examines the Hesperus megaship and the Dredger Clan that caused its recent discovery.

“When the Adamastor derelict received a strange signal, smart money was on it originating from its sister ship, the Hesperus. Both were owned by Azimuth Biochemicals and had vanished 200 years ago.”

“After a united effort to decode and trace the signal, independent pilots located the Hesperus in an asteroid belt around the second star of the Perseus Dark Region KC-V C2-2 system. Like the Adamastor, it was devoid of life – but not alone.”

“Alongside it was a dredger, whose proximity had triggered the Hesperus’s mayday. This was a rare sighting of a Dredger Clan, one of the nomadic tribes that Gunnarson recently discussed.”

“The Scriveners Clan was originally a fleet of research vessels for a long-forgotten academic consortium. Over centuries they became a self-sufficient society, constantly acquiring materials and information. They’re not aggressive, but shun outsiders and jealously guard their ‘Knowledge Core’. I’m fascinated by mentions of research-sergeants and lector-generals, suggesting their culture is a merger of scholastic and military.”

“With the Hesperus claimed as salvage by the Scriveners and its drives stripped, all chance of learning more was lost. Luckily, four encoded data files had resisted upload, and a gap in the dredger’s antiquated firewalls allowed pilots to hack them.”

“The decrypted logs have now been preserved for posterity in a nearby tourist beacon. They tell a disturbing story of corporate rivalry, murder and revenge, but also leave many unanswered questions...”

“We know that survivors abandoned ship to continue searching for ‘alien artefacts’. Did they all die in space or did they find something? What did Azimuth’s probes detect back in 3113? And who the hell is ‘Salvation’, the shadowy figure who contacted pilots to find the Hesperus?”

## 28 APR

### Hadrian Duval Refutes NMLA Allegations

ACT has confirmed receiving evidence that NMLA attacks were orchestrated by Imperator Hadrian Augustus Duval, who immediately denied the claim.

Landgrave Delacroix of the Neo-Marlinist Order of Mudhrid provided details to ACT that the isolationist group Nova Imperium is at the heart of the NMLA. In response, Hadrian Duval made this statement:

“These accusations are completely false. Our political stance is the exact opposite of Marlinism, since we believe in restoring the Empire’s traditions. Nova Imperium forces even fought against the terrorists in Mudhrid, as required by the Treaty of Paresa.”

“As for Lady Astrid being a ‘top NMLA agent’, my wife has been a loyal Imperial Commander since she first piloted a ship.”

Princess Aisling Duval has publicly decried the allegation and offered support to Hadrian Duval. However, Senator Zemina Torval told the Senate:

“Should we be surprised that an extremist organisation performs extreme acts? That this arrogant boy who declares himself ‘Imperator’ should turn to violent rebellion once again? Enemies of the Empire must be punished, even those with Duval blood.”

ACT is fully investigating the Landgrave’s evidence and has asked for patience, despite urgent demands for action from the Alliance, Empire and Federation.

## 29 APR

### Guardian Artefacts Collected for Aegis Project

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Aegis’s anti-xeno research programme has launched with the mass delivery of artefacts constructed by the Guardians.

Many ancient caskets, orbs, relics, tablets, totems and urns were found in the ruins of the mysterious civilisation that collapsed over a million years ago. Pilots then transported these to the Delphi system for analysis.

Professor Alba Tesreau made this announcement:

“Everyone at Aegis is thankful for the impressive effort made by the galactic community. If we can gain new insights into Guardian technology from these samples, then funding and resources for our work may continue.”

Aegis has agreed to pursue the development of weaponry and defences that might prove more effective against the Thargoids. However, as yet the research is in its early stages and there are no signs of imminent breakthroughs.

Pilots who delivered Guardian artefacts can now collect their rewards from Aegis Research at the Alexandria megaship in the Delphi system.

### Federal Leaders Launch Rival Data Requests

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Data deliveries are required by competing initiatives to increase or decrease civilian surveillance in the Federation.

President Zachary Hudson has asked the public to contribute to making the Proactive Detection Bureau more effective:

“The PDB requires access to lesser-known comms channels where terrorists and criminals lurk. Supplying it with data from multiple sources will allow us to root out more potential threats.”

To counter this campaign, Shadow President Felicia Winters aims to protect personal communications from being intercepted:

“My duty is to help citizens preserve their constitutional right to privacy. If enough data can be gathered for baseline testing, we will distribute legal technology and techniques to secure against government intrusion.”

Both campaigns require deliveries of the following data types: anomalous bulk scan data, exceptional scrambled emission data, specialised legacy firmware and unusual encrypted files.

To support President Hudson, pilots should deliver data to Gresley Dock in the Nanomam system.

To support Shadow President Winters, pilots should deliver data to Ito Orbital in the Rhea system.

Political analysts believe that since Hudson and Winters are organising these projects personally, there may be repercussions for the security and stability of the systems where each has influence.

## 30 APR

### Kumo Crew Starports Open for Business

\*Pilots Federation ALERT\*

Five new starports constructed by Archon Delaine’s recent campaign have now become fully operational.

The Orbis stations, which are run by the Kumo Council faction, are listed below:

Kumo City in the Pegasi sector PN-T C3-14 system (Harma region)

California Freeport in the HIP 18390 system (California Nebula)

Crimson Exchange in the HIP 10792 system (Sothis region)

Fort Xeno in the HIP 62154 system (Coalsack Nebula)

Delaine Terminus in the Eol Prou PC-K c9-91 system (Colonia region)

The starports will provide a full range of services, although their low populations bring concerns that they may be under-staffed. Additionally, security agencies in nearby systems expressed fears that since they are operated by the Kumo Crew syndicate, they are likely to harbour black markets and promote illegal activity.

Arch-Corsair Kay Volantyne, a senior member of the Kumo Council, addressed this when she told The Pegasi Sentinel:

“These starports exist solely to encourage trade, which is the lifeblood of our galaxy. Sometimes a little lifeblood can get spilled here and there, so I’m sure our new neighbours will welcome our protection, yes?”

Other factions have appeared in the five systems, including subsidiaries of Sirius Corporation. Several newsfeeds have speculated about an ambiguous connection between the syndicate and the megacorp, whose financial support might explain how the Kumo Crew managed to extend so far beyond its territory.
