**Battlecruisers**Â are a class of large, heavily-armed Capital Ships that occupy a middleground between cruisers and battleships in terms of speed, firepower, and armour. They possess less armour than hulking battleships, but are consequently faster, and they wield larger arsenals than cruisers. In the 34th century, battlecruisers in active service include the Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser and Majestic-Class Interdictor.

Battlecruisers are long-range, independent ships that can subjugate entire systems. They are heavily armed and capable of deploying large fighter squadrons. In addition to their impressive capacity for hard power projection, battlecruisers can also carry out ambassadorial missions for soft power projection.
