A **Titan Partial Tissue Sample** is a sample of the hull of a Thargoid Titan that has been extracted by a Research Limpet. The sample is corrosive to ship modules, and can only be safely transported using a Corrosion Resistant Cargo Rack. 

It can be found floating around in Thargoid Titan graveyards.
