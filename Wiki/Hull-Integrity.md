# Hull Integrity
The ship status icon shows that hull integrity is 11% with an intact shield. 
 		 	 

**Hull Integrity** is a feature of every ship and SRV. All ships have a hull percentage. The hull bar is located between the speedometer and Power Distributor pip in the HUD. Every ship is equipped with a Shield Generator which protects the vessel from physical damage. If the shield is down, the hull will be vulnerable to any external damage. The ship gets destroyed if the hull reaches 0%. You can rebuy a replacement of the ship for credits at a station. 

## Hull damage

There are 4 hull damage types:  

1. Thermal: causes high shield damage, but low hull damage.
2. Kinetic: is the opposite of thermal with high hull damage, but low shield damage.
3. Explosive: deals high hull and external module damage.
4. Absolute: ignores resistances. The damage can be reduced by using Bulkheads.

Ships in Supercruise cannot be damaged by collisions or weapons fire, but they can still suffer damage from overheating, caustic damage, or from an emergency drop out of supercruise. Heat accumulates near a star, and by using Frame Shift Drive (SCO). Caustic damage is almost entirely caused by hazards of Thargoid origin.

Passenger Carriers must have 100% hull integrity to take on passenger contracts. If a ship suffers hull damage while passengers are aboard, the passengers will be frightened, reducing their satisfaction level. 

## Repair

To repair hull integrity, you can use credits to pay for repairs while docked at any location offering repair facilities. Ships equipped with a Repair Limpet Controller can use limpets to repair ships, including themselves. 

A Hull Reinforcement Package can be installed in the Internal Compartment to reduce incoming hull damage.
