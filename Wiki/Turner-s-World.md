Turner's World is named after Mic Turner, the late co-owner of Argent Aerodynamics Amalgamated, Inc. Mic Turner was known as an explorer prodigy specialized in the northern sectors and was one of the founders of the Alliance of Independent Systems when Alioth rose against both the Federation and the Empire.^[2]^

The Alliance Assembly is located in Garden City on Turner's World, which was built close to the old industrial and ship-building city of New Rossyth. The Alliance's member systems are represented by their Council Members in the Assembly, but sessions of the Assembly are conducted virtually.^[3]^^[4]^
