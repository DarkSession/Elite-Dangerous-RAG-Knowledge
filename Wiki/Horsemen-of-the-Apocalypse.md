### History

In 2155, the corporation Interstellar Prison Facilities or IPF, was established with the goal of creating prison colonies for the extraction of resources. The plan was to utilize prisoners for dangerous and often fatal mining operations on planets outside Sol, as these individuals were deemed expendable.

Construction on the first colony's megaship, named The Horsemen, began a year later in 2156. The ship was designed to accommodate 4000 prisoners in sleeper pods and a crew of 250. It was also equipped to carry all the necessary materials and equipment to establish a colony with mining operations on a planet.

Sleeper pods, a precursor to the more advanced cryogenic stasis pods, were used to induce a deep sleep state through lower temperatures and chemicals. However, this technology was considered inhumane as it resulted in nightmares and, in some cases, insanity when used for extended periods. For some unknown reason, sometimes dreams could move over from one person to another and even change their beliefs on a fundamental level.

Due to the economic crash of 2157, IPF faced financial difficulties and was forced to make cost-cutting measures in the construction of the megaship, The Horsemen. Cheaper components were used, and more sleeper pods than the original design could handle were installed. Additionally, security measures were reduced to increase profits. Despite these changes, the megaship was completed in late 2158, slightly over budget.

The Horsemen now housed 8000 sleeper pods and a skeleton crew of only 50. To maintain control over such a large number of prisoners, an AI-controlled system of electrified collars was implemented. These collars were capable of inflicting pain or unconsciousness as a means of punishment and were intended to instill fear in the prisoners to prevent riots. This type of collar was a common sight in prisons on Sol, during this time. Before the sleeping pod was closed, the collar was removed because the collar battery wouldnâ€™t last the trip without recharging. The idea was to put the collar back on the prisoner before they would awake to keep control over the prisoners.

On the 10 of January 2159, the megaship The Horsemen, was finally ready for its maiden voyage, filled with prisoners and crew. Among the prisoners was a 59 year old male called, Gale Ingram. Mr. Ingram was sentenced to prison because of preaching his Doomsday Christan beliefs to others. He believed that the Apocalypse was coming together with the four horsemen as stated in the bible.

As The Horsemen embarked on its journey, Gale Ingram was placed in his sleeper pod and the collar was removed. He had no idea what lay ahead for him and the other prisoners. For the first few weeks, everything seemed to be going smoothly. The AI-controlled system of electrified collars kept the prisoners in line, and the crew carried out their duties without any issues.

But things started to change as the journey progressed. The cheaper components used in the construction of The Horsemen began to fail, causing frequent malfunctions and delays. The crew struggled to keep up with repairs, and tensions started to rise.

Meanwhile, Gale Ingram and the other prisoners began to experience strange and vivid dreams. They started to have visions of the four horsemen of the Apocalypse, just as Ingram had predicted. But these weren't just regular dreams. They were so intense that they felt real, and some prisoners even claimed that they could feel the presence of the horsemen around them.

As time passed, the dreams started to become more and more bizarre. Some prisoners reported seeing the horsemen leading them out of their pods and into the ship's corridors. Others claimed that they were transported to different planets where they were forced to mine for resources. These dreams began to affect the prisoners' mental health, causing them to become increasingly agitated and paranoid.

Ingram, however, was different. He believed that the dreams were a sign from God, and that he was chosen to lead the prisoners to salvation. He started preaching to anyone who would listen, and soon his message began to spread throughout the ship.

As the situation onboard The Horsemen continued to deteriorate, the crew became increasingly overwhelmed. The AI-controlled system of electrified collars malfunctioned, and the prisoners began to rebel. Ingram and his followers led a mass uprising, taking control of the ship and overpowering the remaining crew.

As chaos engulfed their vessel, the Horsemen veered off course and ended up in the Hors system with extensive fires raging across their decks due to the malfunctioning electronics. The situation rapidly spiraled out of control, leaving the crew members scrambling for their lives amidst the flames. The inferno also wreaked havoc on the sleeper pods, damaging many of them beyond repair. In some cases, the control systems for the pods malfunctioned, causing the prisoners within to awaken prematurely, adding to the pandemonium.

After the chaos caused by the fire and malfunctioning electronics, a group of prisoners, including Ingram, saw their chance to escape and fulfill their destiny. They managed to rally 400 other prisoners and board settlement building crafts that were aboard the capital ship. As they descended to a nearby planet, they became known as the Clan of Hors, after their new-found home in the Hors system.

Once the Clan of Hors had settled on the planet, Ingram emerged as their natural leader, and his followers viewed him as a prophet who had led them to salvation. They quickly established a new society, free from the oppression of their former captors.

The Horsemen of the Apocalypse were established as the leaders of this new society, with a council of Elders known as the Four Horsemen. It was believed that the Horsemen of the Apocalypse were the avatars of beings called Reapers, who were immortal and completely neutral. They did not care for deals, fate, or even each other at times, as their only concern was to maintain the "Natural Order" of life and death. As a result, the Horsemen of the Apocalypse were also completely neutral, aligned with neither Good nor Evil. They did not fear death, as they believed that they would always be reincarnated into another body.

As time went on, the Clan of Hors continued to thrive under the leadership of Ingram and the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. They built a new society based on principles of equality and justice, and the Four Horsemen council ensured that these values were upheld.

One of the key beliefs of the Clan of Hors was the idea of reincarnation. They believed that all beings, including humans, were constantly being reborn into new bodies. This belief was reinforced by the presence of the Reapers, who were seen as the ultimate embodiment of this cycle of death and rebirth.

The Horsemen of the Apocalypse were seen as the avatars of the Reapers, charged with maintaining the natural order of life and death in the universe. They were believed to be completely neutral beings, caring neither for Good nor Evil, and only concerned with ensuring that the cycle of life and death continued uninterrupted.

The Four Horsemen council consisted of the eldest and wisest members of the Clan of Hors, who were charged with advising and guiding the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. They were seen as the keepers of wisdom and knowledge, and their opinions were highly valued by the rest of the community.

Over time, the Clan of Hors grew and expanded, building new settlements and forming alliances with neighboring communities. Ingram remained the spiritual leader of the community, and his message of hope and salvation continued to inspire and guide his followers.

However, not all was peaceful within the community. As the Clan of Hors grew in size and power, factions began to form, each with their own beliefs and goals. Some believed that the community should be more aggressive in defending itself against outside threats, while others advocated for a more peaceful and cooperative approach.

The Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as the ultimate guardians of the community's beliefs and values, were often called upon to mediate these disputes and ensure that the Clan of Hors remained united and strong. Despite these challenges, the Clan of Hors continued to thrive and grow, thanks in no small part to the leadership and guidance of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse.
