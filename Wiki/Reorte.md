## History

Reorte was among the second wave of systems colonised in the Old Worlds region in the early 25th century.^[1]^ By the 28th century, the shipbuilding company Faulcon Manspace was founded in the system, and quickly rose to prominence following the success of its first fighter design, the original Viper. In 2982, Faulcon Manspace merged with one of its largest licensed manufacturers, deLacy ShipWorks, to create Faulcon DeLacy, which has held the title of the largest independent ship manufacturer in the galaxy ever since.^[2]^ As one of the Old Worlds, Reorte was a founding member of the Galactic Cooperative in 2696.^[1]^

### Alliance membership

By 3300, with the Galactic Cooperative long since collapsed, Reorte had become a key member of the Alliance. Early in April 3301, a local pirate group launched an insurgency in Reorte in a bid to seize control of the Lave cluster. The pirates captured the Starport of Davies High and declared the region would be renamed "New Caribbean". After three weeks of fighting, the Alliance Elite Diplomatic Corps (AEDC) successfully liberated Reorte using undercover agents and local minor factions.^[3]^

In December 3305, Reorte was selected to host the Alliance's week-long end-of-year festivities. Billions of people flocked to the system, including traders, performance artists, and chefs. A synchronous multi-continental fireworks display was conducted on the planet Home, and Davies High featured a culinary celebration with dishes from across the galaxy. The Reorte Mining Coalition organised a Community Goal to supply the event, and Alliance Prime Minister Edmund Mahon oversaw the opening and closing ceremonies as the guest of honour.^[4]^^[5]^

### Protests against Sirius Corporation

The Sirius Corporation megaship Chariot of Rhea arrived in Reorte on January 14, 3308. It was one of four megaships that the megacorporation deployed to establish a permanent presence in Alliance territory at the invitation of Prime Minister Mahon, another development brought about by the new strategic defence pact between Sirius and the Alliance to counter the threat of Thargoid invasion.^[6]^ Many Old Worlds systems expressed scepticism of the pact, however, and Mahon failed to consult the Reorte Mining Coalition about accommodating Sirius Corp in Reorte. In response, CEO Fergus Cassidy had the Chariot of Rhea blockaded on January 24 and ordered it to depart the system.^[7]^

Tensions escalated into open conflict on January 27 after Sirius Corp refused to relocate its megaship, with the Reorte Mining Coalition taking aggressive action to expel what it considered an illegal incursion by a foreign entity. The Prime Minister ordered the Reorte Mining Coalition to stand down, but Reorte's Assembly representative, Councillor Ainsley Niven, claimed that his people were justified in defending themselves since Reorte's government had not been invited to ratify the strategic defence pact.^[8]^ The Reorte Mining Coalition forced Sirius Corp to retreat from the system on February 3, 3308, and Captain Delfina Dominguez of the Sirius Navy announced the Chariot of Rhea would evacuate to Leesti pending discussions with Allied leaders.^[9]^ The incident caused more members of the Assembly to agree with Councillor Nakato Kaine's skepticism of the strategic defence pact,^[10]^ and on February 25, the Assembly formally censured Mahon for "disregarding the Alliance's principles by unilaterally forcing cooperation with Sirius Corporation".^[11]^

The conflict failed to kill the defence pact, however, and Reorte returned to the spotlight on March 14, 3308 when the Reorte Mining Coalition threatened to withdraw the system from the Alliance in response to the Assembly agreeing to allow Sirius Corp a three-month probationary period to demonstrate the pact's value. CEO Cassidy accused Sirius Corp of cynically pushing for the probationary period to buy time to pressure Alliance officials into accepting the pact. Councillor Niven argued against Reorte Mining Coalition seeking independence, but reported that the faction was convinced that severing ties with the Alliance was less of a risk than giving Sirius Corp access to Reorte. This latest protest undercut Prime Minister Mahon's campaign to promote acceptance of Sirus Corp and prompted speculation that the Alliance might see a wave of independence movements similar to the Federal Rebellion of 3307.^[12]^
