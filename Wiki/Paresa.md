**Paresa** is an Imperial system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. It is the headquarters of Nova Paresa, a radical Imperial faction that advocates traditionalism and isolationism. Between January 3305 and November 3306, Nova Paresa, then known as Nova Imperium, had been outlawed by the Empire for sedition, but the Treaty of Paresa decriminalized the group, and it became a staunch ally in subsequent efforts to stamp out the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army terrorist group.

## History

### Battle of Paresa

Sometime in 3304, Paresa became the headquarters of Nova Imperium, an extremist faction of Imperial soldiers, traditionalists, and sympathizers who sought to depose Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval and replace her with her nephew Hadrian Augustus Duval, as well as withdraw the Empire from cooperation with the rest of human civilisation in order to focus on defending the Imperial people from the Thargoids.^[1]^^[2]^^[3]^ After weeks of rising tensions in late 3304 in which Nova Imperium appeared to be gaining political momentum, Imperial loyalists finally confronted Nova Imperium in the Battle of Paresa after the group began illgally assembling an armada in January 3305.^[4]^^[5]^^[6]^ The battle ended with the capture of Imperator Kaeso Mordanticus,^[7]^ and was followed by his public execution and an Empire-wide purge of Nova Imperium cells and supporters.^[8]^^[9]^ The broken remnants of Nova Imperium reorganised in Paresa under the Imperator's successor, Hadrian Augustus Duval,^[10]^ but still faced opposition from independent pilots who supported the Imperial establishment.

### NMLA terror

In October 3306, Imperator Hadrian was critically wounded by a Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army hit squad that breached the command deck of Dyson City, Nova Imperium's headquarters. The NMLA had recently assassinated Prince Harold Duval, and sought to eliminate all members of the Imperial Family to bring about a democratic revolution within the Empire.^[11]^ On October 28, 3306, Princess Aisling Duval arrived in Paresa aboard the Majestic-Class Interdictor INV Achenar's Courage to offer the Imperator protection and medical assistance.^[12]^

After Hadrian recovered, he announced on November 10, 3306 that he would seek reintegration into the Imperial Family, signalling a new direction for Nova Imperium.^[13]^ While Emperor Arissa denied Hadrian the royal title of prince and any formal position within the Imperial Family in a decree on November 16, he was recognized as a Duval by blood and he and his followers were granted royal pardons. In addition, the Imperial Senate ratified the Treaty of Paresa, which decriminalized Nova Imperium in exchange for acknowledgement of Arissa Lavigny-Duval as the Empire's rightful ruler and contributions in future operations against the NMLA.^[14]^

### Federal incursion

The megaship Harmony's Shield, commanded by the Federation-aligned minor faction League of Mandu, arrived in Paresa on April 29, 3307. The development occurred amid allegations that Imperator Hadrian and his wife, Lady Astrid Minerva-Duval, were leading members of the NMLA and had masterminded the terrorist group's campaign of bombings and assassinations that had started in September 3306. Although the Affiliated Counter-Terrorism unit cautioned that the allegations had not yet been investigated, the Federation, Empire, and Alliance demanded action.^[15]^^[16]^ The League of Mandu believed the allegations and sought to eradicate Nova Imperium in revenge for Nine Martyrs. The Empire-aligned Peraesii Empire Consulate demanded the League's withdrawal, but also pledged to purge the NMLA from Paresa. Imperator Hadrian protested his innocence, but declared that Nova Imperium would defend itself if necessary.^[17]^

The League of Mandu launched military operations on May 6, and Nova Imperium called on the Empire to honour the Treaty of Paresa and come to its defence.^[18]^ Media outlets across the Core Systems warned on May 11 that the conflict in Paresa could pull the Federation and Empire into a full-scale war, as the potential death of Hadrian Duval at the hands of Federal forces would demand retribution from the Emperor even if Hadrian is proven to be a terrorist.^[19]^ Fortunately, the Paresa conflict ended on May 13 without escalating further. Nova Imperium achieved a decisive victory over the invaders, and Federal Ambassador Catherine Carlisle informed the public that the League of Mandu had acted rashly and would soon leave Imperial territory.^[20]^

Inspector Mara Klatt of ACT reported on May 21 that the Landgrave's claims that Hadrian Duval was behind the NMLA could not be authenticated, and that it seemed highly plausible that the NMLA had faked Hadrian's identity. A vindicated Imperator thanked his supporters for defending Nova Imperium and Paresa.^[21]^

### Dyson City bombing

The NMLA bombed Dyson City on October 14, 3307 in an attempt to assassinate Hadrian and his pregnant wife. ACT intercepted a transmission discussing the planned attack and the Praetorian Guard managed to evacuate the Imperator's family only minutes before the bombing occurred, but the other residents of the starport were less fortunate. It was estimated that over 15,000 perished in the explosions, and a similar number were injured. Nova Imperium declared a system-wide state of emergency, and the Empire confirmed it would provide assistance in accordance with the Treaty of Paresa.^[22]^ In the bombing's aftermath, Imperator Hadrian decided to accept the Imperial Senate's offer of protection for himself and Lady Astrid for the sake of the Duval bloodline's survival. On November 2, 3307, Hadrian abdicated his position, discontinued the title of Imperator, and renamed Nova Imperium to Nova Paresa. Praetor Leo Magnus, up that point the head of Hadrian's personal Praetorian Guard, was endorsed to become Nova Paresa's new leader.^[23]^ Magnus assumed the role later that month after resigning from ACT.^[24]^
