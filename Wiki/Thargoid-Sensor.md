> These strange objects are of Thargoid origin. They have the ability to repair themselves by extracting non-organic material from their immediate environment, and this self-repair mechanism can severely damage starships and other machinery. They can also scan nearby vessels and celestial bodies, and transmit information about the scanned object in an encrypted form.

**Thargoid Sensors**, originally known as **Unknown Artefacts** or **UAs**, are devices of unknown purpose created by the Thargoids and found at numerous sites across the galaxy. They can appear on the surface of any planet where any other planet has an ammonia atmospheres present, most commonly an Ammonia Gas Giant. Originally, they were concrentrated in the Pleiades Nebula. 

The first of these objects was discovered by independent pilots on May 4, 3301, although it is believed that the Federation was already researching them by then. When Starports began going offline due to technical problems caused by Unknown Artefacts sold on local black markets, a phenomenon first reported in the Warkushanui system, it became a popular practice among outlaw pilots to sell the objects with the express aim of shutting certain Starports down. On June 26, 3303, it was discovered that the objects could be used to open doors in Thargoid Surface Sites, directly linking them to the Thargoids for the first time. On September 26, 3303, Unknown Artefacts were formally reclassified as Thargoid Sensors.

Thargoid Sensors are approximately two metres long, with a "head" resting atop a segmented stalk supporting three columns of canister-like objects. They emit constant noises that can be heard in close proximity. If shot with weapons or rammed, the Sensor will break up into a number of Materials called Sensor Fragments. A Thargoid Sensor will inflict constant corrosive damage to random ship modules, similar to Toxic Waste, unless transported in a Corrosion Resistant Cargo Rack. If a Sensor is ejected from a cargo hold, it will degrade over time and disintegrate in about six minutes; the degradation can be halted and reversed by returning it to a cargo hold. Note that if a Thargoid Interceptor detects a ship is carrying a Thargoid Sensor, it will immediately become hostile.

It appears that the Thargoid Sensor performs some kind of scan of the closest celestial object or station and then emits a highly distorted Morse code which represents that body.^[1]^^[2]^ A Sensor will also scan all ships within 1 kilometre, and point and align itself with Merope, a star system in the Pleiades Nebula. Recordings and decoding of Sensor data also show that it produces a basic line drawing of the ship it scans.

Thargoid Sensors were originally rare,^[3]^ but have become common in systems with Ammonia Gas Giants. Any landable planet can have a sensor which will be noted by a Nonhuman Signature. They can also be found in a 150 ly radius of Merope at Non-Human Signal Sources or Crashed Thargoid Ships. A Threat Level 4 Non-Human Signal Source will usually contain a single Thargoid Sensor, though if a Thargoid Interceptor is present it will become hostile if the Sensor is retrieved. Alien Crash Sites sometimes contain salvageable Thargoid Sensors found near the wreckage. They can also be found at certain Shipwrecks, such as the crashed Anaconda on LTT 1935 6 a. Outside of the zone centered on the Pleiades Nebula, they may also be found in other regions known for Thargoid activity, such as the Witch Head Nebula and Coalsack Nebula, and on planets known as Nonhuman Signatures.

Sensors can also be obtained from Threat Level 4 Military Convoys, where they are being transported by a Type-9 Heavy and can be stolen using Hatch Breakers. There are two convoy configurations: the first includes the Type-9, a Vulture, two Anacondas, and assorted other ships, and the second includes the Type-9 with an escort of four Anacondas. The Type-9 will usually charge its Frame Shift Drive and jump to another system to escape, so it is recommended to attack in a Wing, with one member focusing on the Type-9 while the others distract the escorts.

Crashed Sensor Probes can also be found on landable bodies with materials beside them all across the galaxy. They are great for Sensor fragment farming. The system must have an Ammonia Gas Giant, or sometimes other worlds with an ammonia presence, for sensors to appear. It is not a sign of any Thargoid presence in the system or nearby. They will show up as Non-Human Signature after a surface scan of a candidate body. Example locations to usually find them are Juenae RX-L c10-8193 and Pleiades Sector FG-Y d32.

## UA Bombing

"UA Bombing" was the colloquial term for the practice of selling Thargoid Sensors en masse at a specific station with a black market, with the goal of shutting that station down using the Sensors' technology-disrupting properties. Stations that were shut down could still be docked with, but had most services disabled, similar to a Lockdown state. While the effects of UA Bombing were not permanent and would reverse over time even without intervention, the suspension of vital station services for several weeks could be an inconvenience.

UA Bombing required a significant quantity of Thargoid Sensors, up to 100, though the number varied. The Sensors had to all be sold at the same station within the same week for the UA Bombing to be successful. Once enough Sensors were sold, the station would experience "technical issues" and be "on the brink of closure". At that time, selling thousands of units of Meta-Alloys at that station before the next weekly server downtime period could counteract the Sensors and prevent the shutdown entirely. If no action was taken, then after the weekly server downtime the station was forced to shutdown. If this occurred, the station would automatically begin repairing itself, but the process took several weeks on its own. Meta-Alloys could be sold there to increase the pace of repairs and shorten the shutdown period.

On November 29, 3304, Aegis announced a breakthrough in Meta-Alloy research that allowed extremely small quantities of Meta-Alloys to provide sufficient protection against Thargoid Sensor-related interference, and arranged for shipments of Meta-Alloys to be distributed to affected stations. This effectively marked the end of UA Bombing, as Thargoid Sensors ceased to cause technological damage to stations, and the sale of Thargoid commodities in general was legalized.^[4]^^[5]^

> 
> Only recently discovered, these mysterious artefacts currently have no designation. Despite much conjecture as to the nature of these objects, it appears that the scientific community is unwilling or unable to openly identify the artefacts' origins. Such mystery only serves to make these objects more widely sought after by wealthy individuals and organisations alike, no matter that their unidentified status automatically prohibits them from being sold on any legal market.

**28 April**: Michael Brookes comes into the forum thread and says, *"Have you listened to them?"* Garbled Morse code has since been discovered to be in the 'Chittering' part of the sound;^[10]^ Multiple video and audio recordings of Thargoid Sensor noises were compiled and analyzed by pilots in an effort to decode their meanings.

**27 June**: CMDR Kerrash talks about various things, including Thargoid conjecture (*"They are coming."*), and the UA and confirms there is something to it, and appeals, *"If any people watching have got in with the UA thing and got halfway in and not looked into it anymore, please pleeease carry on looking, there is something there, there is an interesting secret there, please look, and the SAP 8 containers as well, there is something going on, don't give up!."*^[25]^

**5 July**: CMDR Kerrash comes into the new thread, asks, *"Has anybody cracked it yet?"* when gently prodded follows up, *"Frontier did not spend all this effort in making a wild goose chase, I would imagine quite the fanfare when the truth is uncovered.
