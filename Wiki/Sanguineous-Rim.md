# Sanguineous Rim
The **Sanguineous Rim** is galactic region #34 in the Milky Way. It is bordered by Inner Orion Spur, Outer Orion Spur, Achilles's Altar, Kepler's Crest, and Elysian Shore.

It is speculated that the Sanguineous Rim contains the principal territory of the Thargoids. The Pilots Federation has permit-locked the sub-regions where high concentrations of Thargoids are believed to reside. A handful of nebulae in the region contain isolated Asteroid Bases built by human explorers in 3303.
