**YKE Technologies** (YTEC) is an Independent Research Corporation that specializes in Human-Thargoid relations. The organization's primary goal is to bring an end to the Second Thargoid War through peaceful means. YKE Personnel primitively communicate with the Thargoids through a variety of non-hostile exchanges, including routine Meta-Alloy deliveries. A majority within the organization believe that it is possible to negotiate a treaty or cease fire,  which would inevitably save more lives and end the ongoing conflict.  

On July 12h, 3308, YKE Technologies was finally able to incorporate in HIP 69738.  Notably, the Pilot's Federation mysteriously denied YTEC requests to incorporate within the Mech system. Little is know as to why the applications for entry were denied, as the system itself appeared to meet all known requirements. 

Members of this organization are representatives of a Corporate Entity and are seen as such in the eyes of the law. Representatives must strictly abide by both Corporate & YKE Network Policy. Coordination is vital to both the physical & informational integrity of YKE Technologies.

## Timeline

30 AUG 3308
- Captain Milly Woodard, head of external operations, released a statement on behalf of YKE Technologies regarding the Proteus Wave: "We stand vehemently against the former and current iteration of Azimuth Biotech. We do not tolerate such negligence. It has become strikingly clear that Azimuth seeks to monopolize Thargoid Technology whilst sacrificing countless lives in the process. Upon further investigation into the Aftermath of HIP 22460, YKE research teams discovered that Azimuth was attempting to procure a Thargoid Mothership. A successful initiative in May 3307 resulted in enormous quantities of Guardian artefacts being delivered to the Aegis megaship Alexandria. Thargoid vessels were drawn to the concentration of Guardian technology, and pursued the Alexandria from system to system. When the megaship did not emerge from a hyperspace jump, it was assumed to have been intercepted and destroyed. However, logs were discovered that indicated Azimuth was responsible for the loss of the Alexandria. The Guardian artefacts were never recovered. Shortly after in September 3307, Salvation warned of an impending Thargoid attack in the Cornsar system. Aegis dismissed this as highly unlikely, but Thargoid vessels eventually invaded. Salvation requested for vital equipment to be transported from a Taurus Mining Ventures megaship to Cornsar. The initiative was for a "prototype weapon" that he was constructing. Four days later, the Thargoid Invasion force retreated. We suspect that Azimuth attracted the Thargoids in Cornsar by utilizing the Guardian Technology stolen from the Alexandria. Upon visiting the Cornsar system, YKE research personnel confirmed that this "prototype weapon" was a previous iteration of the Proteus Wave superweapon. Reports gathered from that time indicate Thargoid activity was considerably less active throughout the invasion when compared to the Aftermath of HIP 22460. Crashed Thargoid vessels were located on planetary bodies following the incident, though little evidence of what happened remained. This led us to believe that Azimuth's initial test was internally deemed unsuccessful, despite repelling the Invasion. Our teams were also within HIP 22460 prior to the Proteus Wave's activation. This allowed us to obtain critical information on Azimuth's motives. Fort Asch is a large abandoned surface base on HIP 22460 7 c formerly run by Azimuth Biochemicals. Logs were acquired from several data points, which outlined the organizations intentions. Fort Asch was the primary location for Project Seraph – an attempt to make human controlled Thargoid ships by Azimuth Biochemicals. The Project was suspended following a Thargoid attack on a Federal Convoy in the Pleiades region. Fearing unsolicited attention from the superpowers, Caleb Wycherley suspended Project Seraph in an attempt to hide Azimuth's research. From what our teams have gathered through the logs, it appears that Project Seraph was paused in 3303. On June 20th, 3308, Salvation announced that his partner organization Taurus Mining Ventures is a modern incarnation of Azimuth Biochemicals. Fifteen days after the announcement, on July 5th, 3308, Salvation urgently requested deliveries for Guardian artefacts to HIP 22460. On July 8th, 3308, the Thargoids invaded HIP 22460, mirroring the Thargoid Invasion of Cornsar. The superweapon was inserted into a Thargoid surface site, a sharp contrast from the previous iteration. The Proteus Wave was built to achieve what the prototype could not. Salvation publicly claimed the unique properties of the site would greatly amplify the weapon’s signal. YKE Technologies suspects this to be false. CEO Dylan D was in HIP 22460 to observe the Proteus Wave's activation, and was fortunate enough to escape the Aftermath. He reported a strange unidentified sound that seemingly had no source. This claim was corroborated by several others who escaped. We suspect this to be Azimuth's objective. A signal to the mothership."^[1]^

07 SEP 3308

- Professor Carmen Vance, Director of Stellar Cartographics, confirmed in a public statement that YKE Technologies has pledged towards The Thargoid Advocacy Project: "Informal Communication was established between YTEC personnel and the Thargoid species. The YKE Albatross research carrier was deployed in orbit around planet 4 A, in the Etain system. The crew began preparing an envoy vessel for the journey. The ship was loaded with several stolen Thargoid artifacts which we intended to return. To avoid miscommunication, the artifacts were recovered from AX Carriers rather than harvested directly by YTEC personnel. Upon arrival, the envoy was greeted by several Interceptors, who were receptive to their efforts. The envoy transferred over 500 metric tons of Meta Alloys, Unclassified Relics, and stolen Thargoid samples that had been confiscated by YKE personnel. This interaction taught us one crucial truth; Peace with the Thargoids is not only possible, but of the utmost importance. From this day forward, the Sanctum will be our primary location for Inter-species communication."^[2]^

- Multiple Diamondback Scouts bearing the 'SVI' identification code were spotted in the Uncenii system. This nomenclature is used by the secret enforcement wing of Azimuth Biotech, Black Flight. Its chief duties involve monitoring for Thargoid activity, and preventing the public from discovering any Thargoid-related sites and technology by any means necessary. Pilot reports indicate that the encounter took place within a Convoy Dispersal Pattern signal source; Threat Level 4. Fortunately for YKE Tech, footage of the encounter was captured and returned to Coppel Base.^[3]^

16 MAR 3309 

- Chief Executive Officer Dylan D released an official, but brief report on the 'Nemesis' situation: "A lot has developed in the last 24 hours. Aden Tanner of AEGIS has made widespread contact with members of the Pilot's Federation to investigate Seo Jin-ae's recent disappearance. We were under the impression that AEGIS no longer retained contact, so this was an unanticipated development. Upon further investigation, several data packets were left behind by both Seo and the attackers which enabled us to figure out roughly what happened. She met with Aden Tanner to discuss her findings about the 'Nemesis Protocol'. The contents of said discussion were transposed onto a 'Hacked' Comms Beacon, seemingly left behind by Seo herself for us to scan. It should be noted this conversation between Aden Tanner and Seo Jin-ae was remote, through voice comms. During this meeting, Ms. Seo shared a dense folder of evidence that could potentially prove Salvation, former CEO of Azimuth Biotech, is still alive. The parameters of the 'Nemesis' protocol are still being analyzed by our personnel, and more information will be shared on this particular situation in the near future. Mr. Tanner and Ms. Seo had a productive conversation until they were interrupted by unidentified ships, which forced her to flee into the Shangdi system. Ms. Seo tried to lose the unidentified ships by jumping into various signal sources, but was eventually forced to engage them in the Ankaa system. YTEC personnel share little consensus on the encounter due to the nature of the circumstances. We suspect Seo's neural connection with the Thargoid network, through her implant, triggered a defensive response from the Thargoids themselves. The Thargoids arrived and responded as if Seo was one of their own, which led to the attackers' destruction and vibrant reaction. We are confident that Seo was assisted by Non-Human pilots. YKE Technologies will continue to monitor the situation and keep the employed body updated on any further developments. Our commitment to advancing human-Thargoid communication remains unwavering. We must pick up where she has left off, and figure out what Salvation was truly up to."^[5]^

31 MAR 3309

- A lengthy write-up was shared by CMDR Dylan D, on behalf of the Board of Directors, regarding increasing Federal scrutiny against the Far God Cult: "YKE Technologies, a vocal advocate of inter-species peace, feels the need to address the ongoing persecution of the Order of the Far God and extend our support and offer amnesty to this pacifistic group within YTEC core systems. Despite popular belief that the Order is malicious, we are confident based strictly on example that this group will not negatively impact any system which it inhabits, nor will they work to undermine Anti-xeno operations as the Federal Naval Intelligence Office suggests. It is a matter of public record that the Order of the Far God, otherwise known as the Far God Cult, has been routinely victimized by various organizations in the galaxy, including the F.N.I.O. This topic was originally broached by the Wallglass Investigations Agency in their report: ‘Galactic Mysteries: The Far God Cult’, published on July 19th, 3307. Since this publication, Zachary Hudson has corroborated the claim by acting in bad faith against the rights of Federal citizens, through long-term campaigns against the Order to revoke their right to expression. After extensive analysis, we have determined that this group’s core tenet is one of pacifism, a trait that inherently prevents them from offensive maneuvers of any kind. While the Order's beliefs and practices may be rightfully considered unconventional extremism, they have never posed a threat to any individual or organization, and their beliefs are confined to only words. Only one example exists where the Order of the Far God has acted in defense of another, with Ms. Seo's recent situation. The Order even cooperated with AEGIS, a joint initiative between the three superpowers, by allowing Ms. Seo to leave on her own accord. YKE Technologies firmly believes in upholding the principles of peace and cooperation, and we strongly condemn any actions that seek to suppress or discriminate against individuals or groups based on their beliefs. We find it hypocritical that Federal resources have not been diverted towards responding to Azimuth Biotech and their 'Nemesis' device. The populations of Wandrama seem to believe that action is required, so why is there a stronger Federal response for pacifist fatalists? With the upcoming Federal Elections approaching this summer, we urge all candidates to consider the impact of their stance on issues such as this. We believe that support for diversity and inclusivity is vital to gaining the trust and respect of the citizens they seek to represent. We caution those on the ballot who choose to perpetuate discrimination and persecution for the sake of profit, to tread the line carefully. Therefore, we would like to offer our full support to the Order of the Far God and extend our hand in amnesty to any members of the True Chapters who may have faced persecution or discrimination in the past. Our systems are open to you. We call on all commanders and organizations in the galaxy to recognize the Order's right to exist and practice their beliefs, no matter how esoteric, in peace. It's integral that we as a community approach the Order with an open mind, otherwise we jeopardize what moral integrity we have left. The potential inter-species milestones within their research should be considered, as their own void temples are routine hot-spots for Non-Hostile inter-species activity. Their progress, albeit suppressed, runs laps around the Thargoid Advocacy Project. This proclamation does not align YKE Technologies with the Order of the Far God, we simply believe in the freedom of religion. With this in mind, we urge the Federation, specifically Zachary Hudson, to reconsider their stance on the Order and work towards a more peaceful and cooperative future. Humanity should not be splintered, especially now. YKE Technologies remains committed to fostering a culture of inclusivity and progress, and we stand in solidarity with the Order of the Far God and any individuals or groups who have faced discrimination or persecution."^[6]^
