Neptune with rings
 		 	 

**Neptune** is the 8th planet in the Sol system. Like Uranus, it is in a class of planets known as Ice Giants and is mainly composed of methane and ammonium ices. Neptune is a pristine gas giant, with relatively little storms happening on its cold surface. Neptune, like all of Sol's Gas Giants, has many moons but Triton is the largest and most prominent. Neptune has a ring system, although it is extremely thin, much thinner than Jupiter's.
