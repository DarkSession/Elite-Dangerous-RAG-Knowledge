Taurus Dark Region
 		 	 

The **Taurus Dark Region** is a nebula in interstellar space approximately 460 ly away from Sol. As a dark region, it is a nebula that does not encompass any stars. It is dense enough that it completely obscures light from objects behind it, such as stars and emission or reflection nebulae. The Taurus Dark Region lends its name to the sector it is located in, which is noted to be a significant travel hazard due to the scarcity of star types that can be scooped for fuel.
