**Mbooni** is an independent system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. Access to Mbooni is restricted, and requires a permit that can only be obtained by assisting Salvation and Taurus Mining Ventures with their anti-Thargoid projects. This permit is currently acquired by achieving allied status with Azimuth Biotech(formerly Taurus), and completing the a permit issuance mission from the *Glorious Prospect* megaship in nearby system **LHS 1163**.

At some point, Taurus Mining Ventures gained control of Mbooni's permit rights and deployed a megaship named the Bright Sentinel there. On September 23, 3307, independent pilots who assisted Salvation's efforts to build and test a prototype anti-xeno superweapon in the Cornsar system were granted the Mbooni permit in order to receive their rewards at Bright Sentinel. On October 28, 3307, Bright Sentinel departed for a three-week tour in Merope, but left behind a new permanent colony, Prospect's Deep, on the surface of Mbooni 3 A. Bright Sentinel left again on December 9, 3307 to deploy an anti-xeno superweapon in Maia.

The Guardian Technology Broker at Prospect's Deep offer the Modified Gauss Cannon, Modified Plasma Charger, and Modified Shard Cannon.
