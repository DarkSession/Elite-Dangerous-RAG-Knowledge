A **Guardian Relic** is a Guardian artefact that can be salvaged from Ancient Ruins and Guardian Structures.

## Overview

> 
> 
> The blue crystals are part power source, part computer, part key — and apparently played a central role in Guardian technology. Remarkably, it seems the crystals were grown rather than mined. The log is light on details, but from what Ram Tah has been able to piece together, each crystal was designed to fulfill a specific purpose within the Guardian’s technological network. And, like the panels found at many Guardian sites, the relics incorporate nanobot technology.
