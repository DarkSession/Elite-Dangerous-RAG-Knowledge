Pluto and Charon
 		 	 

**Pluto** is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt in the Sol system. It has rugged icy mountains and flat ice plains. Great blocks of Pluto's water ice crust are jammed together. The plains have rugged icy craters. Cryovolcanoes have been spotted on the surface. From 1930 to 2006, Pluto was considered a regular planet, but it was reclassified after the International Astronomical Union formally defined the term "planet" for the first time.
