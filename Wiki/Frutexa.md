Frutexa Flabellum
 		 	 

> 
> 
> Robust woody plants with deep rooting structures  to gather liquids and hold themselves in place where the ground may be unstable. They are photosynthetic organisms with specialised photoreceptors that work even in low light conditions. As such they are highly successful, and are widespread and diverse in nature. Their small leaf structures protect them against extremely low temperatures and liquid loss in higher temperatures.

**Frutexa** are a species of alien organism found on planets and moons with thin atmospheres across the galaxy. Frutexa are also called shrubs. They can be sampled with the Genetic Sampler and scanned with the Short Range Composition Scanner.  They have a clonal colony range of 150m.

## Description

Frutexa are named after bushes, which they resemble. They appear on plains and on rockside in mountains and hilly areas. Flying low aids observation.^[1]^
