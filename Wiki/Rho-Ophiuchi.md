# Rho Ophiuchi
Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex
 		 	 

The **Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex** in the Inner Orion Spur consists of two nebulae: the dark absorption Rho Ophiuchi Nebula (IC 4603), and the small reflection Rho Ophiuchus Nebula (IC 4604). These may also be considered part of The Great Rift. The complex is one the closest star-forming regions to Sol, with an estimated 3000 solar masses of material.^[1]^

The reflection nebula has vivid red hues, and no stars currently inside the nebula proper. The dark nebula is only a few light years across and has no internal bodies. The nebula complex is illuminated by the triple star system 5 Rho Ophiuchi.^[1]^
