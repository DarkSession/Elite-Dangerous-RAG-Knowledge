**Carcosa** is a system within the Colonia Region. On October 20, 3303, a criminal organization based out of the Carcosa system called The Nameless started attacking ships in the Colonia system. In response, the Colonia Council issued a call for aid from the galactic community to quell the insurgents. Likewise, The Nameless attempted to entice independent pilots to join their side and usurp the Colonia Council.^[1]^ By October 27, the Colonia Council had successfully rebuffed The Nameless and restored order, but the brief conflict had tarnished the Colonia Region's record of peace.^[2]^
