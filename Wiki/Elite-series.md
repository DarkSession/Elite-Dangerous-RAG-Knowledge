Elite - 30 Years on the Frontier
 		 	 

The **Elite series** is the longest running space simulation series in history, tracing its origin to 1984. This record is verified by Guinness World Records.^[1]^

## History

The critically-acclaimed *Elite* series started with the original *Elite*, co-created by David Braben and Ian Bell in 1984. Elite's open-ended game model, advanced game engine and revolutionary 3D graphics ensured that it was ported to virtually every contemporary home computer system, and earned it a place as a classic and a genre maker in gaming history. According to Guinness World Records: *"Elite was the first game to feature a (3D) procedurally generated world."*^[2]^

The sequel *Frontier: Elite II* was released in 1993. The third title and direct sequel *Frontier: First Encounters* was published in 1995. Guinness World Records states *"Frontier: Elite II was the first game to feature procedurally generated star systems."* and *"Frontier: First Encounters was the first game to contain procedurally generated terrain and textures."*^[2]^

Over a quarter of a century after the original, David Braben of Frontier Developments launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to verify whether there's broader interest in a fourth game in November 2012. Frontier had been working on the game as a "skunk-works" background activity for some time prior to its Kickstarter launch.

Elite Dangerous was released for Windows PC on December 16, 2014. Since then it has had many updates, seasons of expansions like Elite Dangerous: Horizons and launched on multiple platforms. Elite Dangerous: Beyond is scheduled for release in Q1 2018.

On 18 June 2015, David Braben and Frontier Developments received a certificate from Guinness World Records, because Elite is officially the longest running space simulation series in history. The certificate says *"The longest running space simulation series is Elite created by David Braben and Ian Bell and was released on 20 September 1984. Officially amazing."*^[1]^

Every Elite game and media takes place in the same fictional universe called the Elite Universe.
