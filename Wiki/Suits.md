**Suits** are standard gear for commanders aboard ships and on the ground. There are 4 suit models with different tools and functions. Suits can be upgraded, modified, and saved to Loadouts.

## Suit models

These are the available suit models. Originally, only the default Flight Suit was available, but 3 models were added in *ED: Odyssey..^[1]^^[2]^*

## Activities

The properties of each suit make it ideal for specific activities.

- The Flight Suit is the most basic and limits you to courier missions. This default suit is intended for pilots onboard ships.
- The Artemis Suit is essential for exobiologist activities, because it has the Genetic Sampler.
- The Maverick Suit is best for faction raid and settlement raid missions, and its Arc Cutter is required for many salvage missions.
- The Dominator Suit is designed for combat, boasting two primary weapons and increased slots for combat consumables. It lacks a third tool slot.

Scan kills with the Profile Analyser to collect any additional bounties.

Initially it may be tough without an upgraded Maverick suit. However, ground settlements that are owned by an Anarchy faction allow you to do anything without incurring fines or bounties. So Anarchy settlements are best to farm for materials to upgrade your suit.

## Functions

### Protection

All space suits provide breathable air and limited protection from vacuum and extreme environments as long as they are powered. Shields can also be activated to absorb a limited amount of weapons fire, and are a must in combat situations as an unshielded suit is relatively flimsy, particularly against kinetic, plasma, and explosive damage sources.

Suits also have finite tolerances for extreme environments. They can only withstand gravitational forces up to 2.69 G, and temperatures up to 700 K. A suit will also need to expend additional energy to regulate the wearer's body temperature in environments that fall above or below an approximate safe zone of 182 K.^[3]^^[4]^ In the event a commander disembarks from their ship on a planet that is above the 700 K limit, their suit will be unable to compensate for the added heat and they will sustain continuous health damage.

### Batteries

Venturing into an especially hot or cold environment, activating shields, and using the suit's built-in flashlight all drain additional power from the suit's battery. When a suit battery nears exhaustion, it will automatically terminate non-vital processes such as the flashlight to try and extend battery life. When a battery runs dry, the suit will stop producing air and the wearer will have only a limited supply of reserve oxygen before they suffocate. Suits will not expend power when the wearer is in a normalised environment with breathable air.

Suit batteries can be replenished in the field with portable Energy Cells, or by using the Energylink tool to draw power from a Suit Recharge Socket, which can be found throughout settlements. Entering a ship or vehicle will fully restore a suit's batteries and health.

### Backpack

A space suit's backpack allows the wearer to carry several  (such as grenades and healthpacks), as well as a limited amount of Components, Goods, and Data. Each model of suit offers a differing amount of carrying capacity, with the Maverick Suit boasting the largest.

Suit backpacks are also equipped with a limited jetpack function that can allow the wearer to jump to significant heights or leap great distances, especially on low-gravity worlds. Using a backpack's maneuvering thrusters quickly drains the suit battery, but can provide an advantage in combat situations or be used to quickly reach areas that are otherwise difficult to access, such as settlement rooftops.

## Upgrading and Engineering

Certain Components and Goods can be used to upgrade a suit's resilience and allow more Engineering modifications to be added to it. New suits begin at Grade 1, and can be upgraded to Grade 5 (except for the Flight Suit, which cannot be upgraded). 

Pioneer Supplies stores occasionally stock suits at up to Grade 3 that may also come with one or more Engineer modifications pre-installed; these high-grade suits are one-of-a-kind and cost substantially more than normal stock.^[5]^ Upgrading can be performed at any Pioneer Supplies store, and will reset all suit cosmetics.

### Method

Upgrading a suit requires a considerable investment of components, goods, and data. As credits are much easier to come by in large quantities than materials, buying pre-upgraded suits from Pioneer Supplies stores is a convenient way to obtain suits up to Grade 3, which is enough to handle most on-foot activities competently. All pre-upgraded suits are first-come-first-served, but stores will restock once a week (normally on Thursdays). Further materials can be stolen from Settlements, salvaged from planetary Points of Interest, or given as rewards for completing on-foot missions (found in station Concourses or at settlements).

### Modifications

Modifications can be installed on suits by unlocking and visiting Engineers who specialise in pilot equipment. Each modification requires a one-time payment of items and credits to install. Note that once a modification is added, it cannot be removed from the suit or replaced. If other modifications are desired, another suit of the same model must be purchased and upgraded to hold those mods. Multiple specialised Loadouts can be created to prepare for different situations.
