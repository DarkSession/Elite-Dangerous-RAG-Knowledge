## Overview

It has improved performance and stats compared to previous iterations of the Cobra.^[5]^ It has a new redesigned cockpit. The pilot's seat is in the center, with two multicrew seats on either side. The large cockpit windows offer great visibility.^[5]^ The floor is wide and transparent.

^[6]^ With exceptional cargo capacity for its size, the Cobra MK V is by far the best small ship for the trading and mining roles, and arguably the best in its price range, almost matching the Type 6 in cargo capacity while having a better range of hard points, allowing it to equip all available mining tools.

In combat, the Cobra Mk V excels, outclassing its own predecessors and all other small ships with the exception of the Vulture.  Compared to the Vulture, the Cobra is faster, but the Vulture surpasses it in armour, manoeuvrability, shields and firepower, generally making it the superior ship in combat. The Cobra is, however, more versatile and considerably less expensive than the specialized Vulture, and its greater speed allows it to easily disengage and escape any losing engagement.

With a well above average jump range and a relatively low price point, the Cobra also performs admirably as an explorer, once again beating out its predecessors and most other small ships, but is slightly outclassed in jump range by the cheaper Dolphin and significantly outclassed by the equally priced Diamondback Explorer. However, the Cobra's arguably superior optional internals, including a class 5, as well as its greater visibility, improved manoeuvrability and two multi crew seats arguably make it more attractive in the role despite the lower maximum range.

Cobra Mk V hardpoints convergence
 		 	 

The Cobra Mk V has three medium hardpoints, one on top of the ship behind the cockpit and two underneath towards the front of the wings, and two small hardpoints, on top of the ship roughly even with the pilot's seat.
