> A small colony of brightly coloured micro-organisms form a mesmerising, ever changing fashion statement. Capable of self-sustaining, the colony will feed on dirt and skin flakes, keeping the wearer clean and healthy. When mature, the micro-organisms lose their bright colors and excrete a heady natural perfume.
