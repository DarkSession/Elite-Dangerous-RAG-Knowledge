## Usage

The Caustic Sink Launcher will automatically remove caustic damage from the equipped ship and absorb future caustic damage until the loaded caustic sink is full. The expended caustic sink must then be manually ejected before a new caustic sink can be loaded and absorb more caustic damage.

Caustic sinks can be restocked at Starports, or via Synthesis.
