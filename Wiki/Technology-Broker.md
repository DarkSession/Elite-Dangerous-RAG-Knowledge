A Guardian Technology Broker
 		 	 

A **Technology Broker** is a dealer in new and rare technologies and items. These contacts appear in various stations across human-inhabited space and can generally be found in highly populated systems with a high security level.^[1]^ There are two types of Tech Brokers distinguished by the type of technology they offer from their inventories: Human and Guardian.

Visit Technology Brokers to see what items they currently have available and unlock those items by handing in the requested commodities and materials. Note that all requested commodities and materials must be given simultaneously, the Technology Broker cannot be paid in separate installments. Afterwards, the unlocked item will be permanently available for purchase with credits in Outfitting at any station with a Technology Broker of the same type.^[1]^

A subset of Technology Broker items are pre-Engineered modules, and unlocking these items involves a different process. Instead of permanently unlocking the module for purchase with credits, one payment of the requested resources will immediately grant one pre-Engineered module which is placed in storage in local Outfitting. More of these modules can be obtained only by paying more resources each time.

## Notes

- Technology Brokers were added with *Elite Dangerous: Beyond* Chapter One (3.0) on February 27, 2018. Their services are only available to owners of *Elite Dangerous: Horizons*.
- From October 15, 2020 to October 29, 2020, the Technology Broker at Bray Landing in Yuanjia gained all unlockable items, with the exception of the three Guardian Ship-Launched Fighters and the Thargoid Interceptor Bobblehead, and offered them at discounted rates. Guardian items required 75% less requested commodities and materials, while Human items required 50% less. This discount was made available during a Community Goal to protect the Witch Head Nebula from a Thargoid invasion, and was extended to two weeks after all six tiers of the CG were completed.
