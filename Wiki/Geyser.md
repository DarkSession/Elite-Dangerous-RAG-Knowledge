Geyser in BD+74 526 B 3 a
 		 	 

**Geysers** are vents in the surface of a planet or moon which periodically release hot water or steam. Geysers can take time to build up the correct amount of pressure to erupt, so they are not always active, which can make them difficult to spot from high altitudes.

## Types

There is 1 type of geyser:

- Water Geysers

## Geyser jump

Geyser jets can be used to propel an On Foot commander or SRV into the air by walking or driving directly on top of the ejecta.

## Notes

- Prior to *Elite Dangerous: Beyond* Chapter 4, explorers would document the planetary body, latitude, and longitude of geyser locations for later reference. Manual discovery of these locations could take many hours or even days. Chapter 4's improvements to discovery tools enabled automatic logging of these locations in the Codex for easy reference. An unfortunate side effect of that update is that some classic geologic locations were erased or heavily modified.
