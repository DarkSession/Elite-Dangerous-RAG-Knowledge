The **Seeker Missile Rack** is a weapon module that launches heat-seeking, explosive-tipped missiles. When launched after acquiring a lock on a target, seeker missiles will continuously pursue that target until they either successfully detonate or run out of propellant. The seeker missile's lock can only be broken by an Electronic Countermeasure, or the missile itself is destroyed by a collision, weapon fire, or a Point Defence Turret. Seeker missiles travel more slowly and inflict less damage than dumbfire missiles, and are most effective against the unshielded hulls of ships.

## Engineered Seeker Missile Rack V1

A pre-Engineered Class 2 Seeker Missile Rack with Lightweight, High Capacity, and Thermal Cascade named "Engineered Seeker Missile Rack V1" can be purchased at Human Technology Brokers. Unlike unlocking most other Technology Broker items, which makes them permanently available for purchase with credits at station outfitting services, unlocking the Engineered Seeker Missile Rack V1 immediately places one module in local storage at no additional cost. The module must also be unlocked repeatedly in order to obtain multiple copies. This pre-engineered module cannot be further modified at an engineer.

Unlocking requires the following Materials and Commodities:

- 16 Proto Radiolic Alloys
- 24 Conductive Ceramics
- 26 Hybrid Capacitors
- 28 Phosphorus
- 10 Osmium
