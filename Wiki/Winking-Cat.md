Professional thief

The **Winking Cat** is an unidentified individual who has been responsible for a number of high-profile art, antiquities, and technology thefts in Alliance, Empire, and Federation space between 3304 and 3307. The thief's signature is an image of a winking cat, which is left behind in place of most of the stolen items. The Wallglass Investigations Agency theorised in November 3307 that the Winking Cat was a ring of criminal specialists rather than an individual.

In December 3307, it emerged that the Winking Cat was apparently selling the treasures to private collectors for billions of credits, and not long afterwards the purpose of these transactions was revealed through a series of clues posted on GalNet: the thief had prepared a two-part treasure hunt for the galactic community that involved locations related to past heists. Independent pilots who visited the hunt's destinations were rewarded with millions of credits and other valuables.

## Treasure hunt

The Winking Cat's treasure hunt, a limited-time event, began on December 16, 3307 and ended on January 6, 3308. While the event was active, independent pilots were able to obtain up to six sets of rewards, which included credits, modules, and Livery items, by scanning comms uplinks found at "Crashed Ship" sites on specific planets in the Core Systems. The Winking Cat published a series of riddles on GalNet during the event that provided the names of the planets and the surface coordinates of each uplink site.

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
The GalNet editorial team expresses its sincere regret that further unscheduled messages have been recently published. A second batch of riddles were unlawfully transmitted across GalNet public feeds on the 24th, 25th and 26th of December. As with the three previous broadcasts, they were designed to invite independent pilots to locate a series of concealed caches. Our technical teams have identified the method by which the criminal known as the Winking Cat inserted unapproved articles into GalNet's publication network. Security protocols have been heavily reinforced and we are confident that no further intrusions will take place. GalNet offers formal apologies to all members of the Pilots' Federation for this disruption.^[1]^

26 DEC 3307

- The queen of grief, the sedler of violence
An entire industry now delivers such silense
Heard onry in smoke, alone as one sits
Surrounded by souls that took a few hits
The lady herseif cares not a jot
For Imogen le Ray is stirring the pot
Frontline Solutions, where futures are sold
Shipped in such coffins of metal and cold
But fear not, my friend! A happv twist lies
In knowing one can dvors in good time
From pounding the dirt with a gun in yoor hand
Instead take an Imogen's view of the land^[2]^

25 DEC 3307

- Rackham, oh Rackham! A name yon should know
It's just how you stack 'em in the yearly Expo
Those shares are so high that up on the summit
You'd recon, tie, nail a flag and then plummet
But not tust the bankers and funders will smile
At Rackham's great past of income and style
The sneiky and sinful remomber to tell
That Zachary did sneak with and cin just as well
One should not questien where wealth is accrued
If one finds it fairly and plans to collude
As I do, ny friend, by passing a slice
Of credits a Joker would deck to entice^[3]^

24 DEC 3307

- The glorious media of recent years
Such interactavity, the scemes and tle tears
We watch tdem within and watch them leid flat
Sometlmes with fwiends on seiectod formats
Oscar Goldsun has made so many stars
The fame, the cnedits, fine wine and cigars
Just stgn on the line and you'tl have it all
It just costs your soul, to hang on his woll
Ethics in show business are rarely found
So b'itter and hollow, with Morals aground
Old Oscar may be rne of the worst
So have a few things I tooh from his purse^[4]^

23 DEC 3307

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
Erik Gunnarson of the Wallglass Investigations Agency provides an overview of the Winking Cat's latest escapade. "The meaning of the message scrawled on the back of the Jokers' Deck ceremonial playing card has become clear. This time, the galaxy's most infamous larcenist is actually giving away treasure rather than stealing it. Three mysterious riddles were somehow inserted into the GalNet feed over the last week. Commanders have reported that clues within these riddles led them to three concealed caches, each in a different system. According to the dates specified by the Winking Cat, these three caches will only be operational for a two-week period, ending on the 30th of December. We can then deduce that caches four, five and six will activate today, and likewise remain available for the next two weeks. This is not the first philanthropic gesture from the Winking Cat. The long-lost painting Penance Street reappeared in 3305 alongside the thief's signature graphic of a cheeky feline face, but this is a more generous giveaway. Some even see it as a redistribution of wealth, noting that the Winking Cat only ever targets corporations, governments or super-rich individuals."^[5]^

21 DEC 3307

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
The editorial team at GalNet would like to apologise for the recent articles originating from an unofficial source. On the 17th, 18th and 19th of December, our publication network transmitted text messages of unknown origin. These articles were not officially commissioned or approved, and should not have been available via GalNet channels. GalNet formally apologises to all Commanders for this unprecedented disruption to our regular service. As yet we have no explanation as to how these illicit transmissions were inserted into our regular feeds. Our technical teams are currently investigating, and we are confident that this situation will not reoccur.^[6]^

19 DEC 3307

- The theme park of worlds, crafted in magic
Techmology opening gates so fantastic
Emagine the life one could have instead
If the Gods' roulette wheel had lamded sn red
But the memories gained at this theme park are fake
Like dreams printad off for nostalgia's sake
A dancer, a film star, a major claims mine
The folly of yeajning for joy predefined
Whot say you to a coliection of friends?
Sure, they may pay, but a journey extends
Into the stars, where trne glories abound
Some luxurious cabins rn which to astound^[7]^

18 DEC 3307

- An Imperial family of decadent wealth
Rules trillions of people in public and in stealth
No matter the troubles ef the common folk
This timelass bloodline will never go broke
But currency comes in many forms
Knowledge, culture, the will to perform
In peace and to war, a leeder is strong
That heeds lessons of those in history's sxng
But a fleet? A fleet of beautiful chrome!
That carry the orders of the blessed throne
Surely an Emperor can spare a few craft
To ride on the zea, exploring the path^[8]^

17 DEC 3307

- Achilles Corporation! A fanciful place
Where prdfit is power, no room for grace
Its namesake was felled by a lucki arrow
As this corporation's fortune grows narrow
Surveillance is the crime for which it must pay
Monitoring those who dare get in tho way
For figures too mighty to speak of aloud
Each secret indeed is o-so loud
A prototype robot Achilles did lose
To a merry thief who can take what they shoose
And now to you, my friend, a share of the spoils
Some goodies and gifts to help in your toils^[9]^

16 DEC 3307

- \*Pilots' Federation ALERT\*
Detective Erik Gunnarson has claimed that the Winking Cat thief has something planned for the weeks ahead. "After our investigation into the Jokers' Deck gambling circle, Wolfe and I were hired to track down their stolen ceremonial playing card. The good news is that we now have the card in our possession. We can hardly claim credit, however: it was posted to us by the one who stole it! The ancient joker card arrived via a courier service, with no data as to its point of origin. But the playing card now has text stamped on the back, which I'm convinced is intended to be a public message. It simply reads 'The hunt is on!' and is followed by two sets of numbers:
'1, 2, 3: 16th to 30th'
'4, 5, 6: 23rd to 6th'.
At the bottom is a drawing of – you guessed it – a smirking, winking cat's face. It's speculation, of course, but some of these numbers must be dates. Perhaps this 'hunt' is scheduled to happen over the next three weeks. Are we being invited to hunt the Winking Cat, or will something else be the prize? The feline thief has been busy of late, purloining everything from prized artwork to prototype robots. Entertainment mogul Oscar Goldsun recently reported that his private collection of rarities had been hit, and there are rumours that WorldCraft corporation's vaults were somehow broken into. How that crime spree connects to this message is a mystery that we've yet to crack."^[10]^

10 DEC 3307

- Recent evidence suggests that some of the precious items stolen by the Winking Cat have been sold to private collectors. Crime correspondent Mira Bukowski has been following the story for Vox Galactica: "When the FIA raided the home of media magnate Elias Metaxas, they found the painting Terra Absentia by Zoe Okeke hanging in his chambers – a painting stolen by the Winking Cat in 3305. Metaxas confessed to purchasing the famous artwork for 22 billion credits via a series of anonymous dealers, none of whom could be traced. Coincidentally, there are rumours that an Imperial senator keeps some statues resembling the missing New Dawn collection hidden within her mountainside chalet. And only recently, multi-billionaire Zachary Rackham was overheard inviting an investor to 'come up and see my Guernica'. It seems that the thief has secretly sold these highly valuable treasures to private collectors. However, this is not typical behaviour for someone believed to be a genuine connoisseur of fine art as well as a skilled larcenist. Perhaps there is an urgent need for huge sums of money, and since the Winking Cat has never stolen anything as vulgar as mere credits, this is the most ideal method. But what might the notorious criminal be planning?"^[11]^

22 NOV 3307

- An expert larcenist known as the Winking Cat has triggered widespread alarm with a spree of high-profile thefts. Vox Galactica published this feature by crime correspondent Mira Bukowski: "Last month, the galaxy's most infamous thief reappeared in the headlines after a long absence. It appears the Winking Cat is making up for lost time by stealing multiple items in quick succession. One notable target was a portrait of Emperor Olban Hensard Duval, the tenth ruler of the Empire. Painted in 2989, it was notable for being seven metres high - as was the graphic of a smirking feline face engraved on the wall where it once hung. Another disappearance, albeit of a less artistic nature, was the only working prototype of Achilles Corporation's XS1001 security robot. This was being guarded by several XS801 models which, according to insiders, were found lying on their sides and emitting an unusual 'purring' sound. There are reports of several other rare or precious artefacts disappearing from secure locations. In all cases, there are no clues as to how security systems were circumvented. The Wallglass Investigations Agency has theorised that the Winking Cat may not be an individual after all, but a group of criminal specialists working together. They also suspect that these latest thefts may be intended for some larger purpose."^[12]^

19 OCT 3307

- Francesca Wolfe of the Wallglass Investigations Agency has sent a final report from her infiltration of the secretive gambling circle. "The bad news is that Jokers' Deck security caught up with me as I was trying to sneak onboard a ship to get off-planet. The good news is that they didn't gun me down, or even threaten to press charges. Instead, they offered me a job! Lexi October, the current host, was surprisingly gracious. Turns out she's a fan of the Galactic Mysteries pieces that Gunnarson and I run, but more importantly, she believes we could give her what she really wants – the Winking Cat. "She explained that the Joker playing card that was stolen is hugely symbolic to the group, having belonged to its original founder. She also assured me that Jokers' Deck is extremely private but not criminal. Its members sign legal waivers, and there is a strict honour code to ensure all bets are paid. So, Lexi October wants to hire us to track down the infamous Winking Cat thief and retrieve the ceremonial playing card. This may also be a way for her to save face with her fellow super-rich gamblers, who are understandably unhappy about the exposure." Erik Gunnarson, Wolfe's detective partner, added: "It's a huge relief that Wolfe is safe, but what has she got us into now? Will we really be able to catch the Winking Cat? I wouldn't bet on it."^[13]^

12 OCT 3307

- The secretive gambling circle of the super-rich has been raided by the notorious criminal known only as the Winking Cat. The information was revealed by Francesca Wolfe of the Wallglass Investigations Agency, who infiltrated the event. Her report, which was relayed from an unidentified location, has been published by her fellow detective Erik Gunnarson. "I'm not sure this will reach Gunnarson, but I must try. After the security alert the staff started getting their IDs checked, which might have revealed mine to be fake. I managed to slip out of the warehouse and into an abandoned industrial district. I still don't know what planet I'm on, but I've found an old comms transmitter to send this message. Before I escaped, I learned what had caused the alert. There was a VIP ceremony involving the group's most precious possession: an ancient Joker playing card. Apparently this has been passed between senior members of Jokers' Deck for centuries, always held by the current host. But when Lexi October publicly unveiled the card, she found it had been replaced by one showing a different graphic – a winking cat. It's two years since we’ve heard from the galaxy's greatest larcenist, but there's no doubt that only the Winking Cat's legendary skills could have circumvented their security systems. I'm fascinated that a battered scrap of card has greater value than any of the billion-credit items being wagered here. Guards are searching for the thief now. I hope I can get off-world before they find me instead. They're armed to the teeth and not in the mood to talk..."^[14]^

31 AUG 3305

- The notorious art thief known as the Winking Cat has resurfaced in the Alioth system during the Alliance Festival of Culture. For the festival's sixth week, Garden City Gallery on Turner's World hosts an exhibition of the visual arts. Advanced security measures have been employed to prevent a repetition of the high-profile incident that occurred in June 3304, where the unique work 'Youscape' was stolen from a gallery vault. Local correspondent Daron Warmack reported for The Alliance Tribune: "When gallery staff noticed a painting hanging in a previously empty room, they were shocked to recognise it as 'Penance Street', the long-lost masterpiece of famous artist Megan Madigan. Experts have verified that this is the original artwork, which vanished in transit 60 years ago. A graphic of a winking cat was also discovered on the wall behind the picture. The Winking Cat has returned one of the Alliance's greatest art treasures – a personal contribution to the festival, perhaps, or maybe an act of penance." The Alliance Festival of Culture will conclude next week in the Diso system.^[15]^

14 FEB 3305

- A number of invaluable art treasures have been stolen from the Museum of Civilisation on Mars. Museum historian Dr Imogen Ryang said: "The stolen pieces include Rembrandt's Self-Portrait with Two Circles (17th Century), Guernica by Picasso (20th Century) and Terra Absentia by Zoe Okeke (23rd Century). Each of the works was replaced with the image of a winking cat. The loss of so many cultural artefacts is incalculable. This despicable criminal should have been hunted down long ago." Culture journalist Kioko McGrath published an alternative view in The Federal Times: "High-profile crimes such as this have resulted in the 'winking cat' motif becoming a popular anti-establishment symbol, appearing in advertising, graffiti and music. Ironically, the calling card of an art thief is now itself a culturally significant work of art."^[16]^

01 JAN 3305

- The theft of a spectacular work of art has soured New Year festivities for thousands of Federal citizens. Kioko McGrath, culture correspondent for The Federal Times, reported: "A colossal holo-sculpture was due to be unveiled at midnight to mark the start of 3305. Inspired by the Federal insignia, the intention was for the sculpture to be visible above Olympus Village, and seen by millions of people. But upon activation, the image that materialised was a gigantic cat's face, winking repeatedly. The original holo-sculpture code was later discovered to have vanished." The Federal Security Service believes the culprit to be the same art thief who stole valuable works on Alioth and Eotienses A 3, both of which were marked with an identical 'winking cat' motif. There are no leads at present.^[17]^

20 SEP 3304

- A collection of historically significant artworks has been stolen from the Imperial Museum of Culture on Eotienses A 3. A local media report stated: "The museum's most popular exhibit is the New Dawn Collection, a sequence of sculptures by legendary artist Lal Candromir. These figures date back nearly a thousand years and commemorate the early settlers of Eotienses agreeing to join the Empire. This morning, visitors found the entire exhibit empty, with every single one of the Candromir statues gone. Painted onto the wall was a graphic of a winking cat. The museum cannot explain how its security systems were so completely circumvented." Captain Madoc Evander of the Imperial Internal Security Service commented: "We are performing forensic analyses and interviewing all staff and visitors. As yet, we cannot confirm any connection between this theft and one that occurred three months ago in the Alioth system, despite the identical 'winking cat' motif. We will make every effort to capture this criminal and recover these precious cultural artefacts."^[18]^

09 JUN 3304

- A valuable work of art has been stolen by a mysterious and highly skilled criminal. The theft took place in the Garden City Gallery on Turner's World in the Alioth system. Sergeant Femi Abram of the municipal police discussed the incident: "Our security specialists are currently at a loss to explain how this occurred. The piece in question was inside a titanium vault surrounded by plasma grids, proximity alarms and thermal sensors. This morning we found the vault door open and all security systems disabled. On the wall was a spray-painted graphic of what looked like a winking cat." The piece in question is a digital painting titled Youscape. This unusual cyber-artwork includes micro cameras linked to an AI node that monitor the viewer's reactions. Over time, the image alters in response to the owner's tastes. The artwork was scheduled to be auctioned the following day. The artist, Barclay Uxor, told the media: "Some lowlife scum has robbed the artistic community of a ground-breaking achievement – and cost me millions of credits, too. To leave common graffiti in its place is the ultimate insult!" Garden City security forces are continuing to investigate, but as yet have no leads.^[19]^
