The **Heatsink Launcher** is a utility module that can be used to temporarily reduce a ship's heat levels. When activated, all of a ship's internally stored heat is rapidly transferred into a heatsink, and then the heatsink itself is ejected from the ship.

## Usage

The Heatsink Launcher can be used both in normal space and while in Supercruise. Heatsinks are most commonly used in connection with Silent Running or with larger ships dumping excess heat when making multiple hyperspace jumps or straying too close to a star while fuel scooping. Heatsink Launchers are also important to prevent overheating caused by the use of Shield Cell Banks or other high-heat modules and weapons. Additionally, deploying a heatsink partially replenishes the Power Distributor's WEP (weapon) capacitor; each active heatsink provides 2.0MW/s of power to WEP, allowing more powerful weapons to be sustained for a short period of time. This effect stacks with multiple heatsinks.

Heatsink Launchers are installed on a ship's Utility Mount. Multiple launchers can be installed, but activating them will only ever fire a single heatsink from one launcher at a time, even if all Heatsink Launchers are linked to the same fire group. Each launcher holds 3 heatsinks and each heatsink can hold approx 90-100% of the ship's maximum heat capacity. Heatsinks can be launched via a dedicated key binding or the fire button of the fire group to which the launcher is assigned. Hardpoints do not need to be deployed to launch a heatsink.

Heatsinks can be restocked at Starports, or via Synthesis.

## Engineer Modifications

The following modifications can be applied to this module by Engineers to enhance its abilities:

- Ammo capacity
- Lightweight
- Reinforced
- Shielded

## Sirius Heatsink Launcher

A pre-Engineered Heatsink Launcher with enhanced Ammo Capacity named "(Pre-Engineered) Heatsink Launcher" can be purchased from the Human Technology Brokers at the Spirit of Laelaps in the V886 Centauri system.   Unlike unlocking most other Technology Broker items, which makes them permanently available for purchase with credits at station outfitting services, unlocking a Sirius Heatsink Launcher immediately places one module in local storage at no additional cost. The module must also be unlocked repeatedly in order to obtain multiple copies. Note that although the included modifications can be removed, Engineers cannot re-apply them or apply any other modifications to these modules.

Unlocking requires the following Materials and Commodities:

- 8 Mechanical Scrap
- 6 Niobium
- 6 Vanadium
- 5 Mechanical Components

###### Specifications (compared to a regular Heatsink Launcher):

| Ammo Maximum | Reload Time |
| --- | --- |
| 5 (+2) | 17.5 s (+75%) |

Note that the Sirius Heatsink Launcher is also significantly superior to an Ammo Capacity engineered Heatsink Launcher.  It adds two, rather than just one, round of ammo.  Moreover, the Sirius Heatsink Launcher incurs none of the mass increase of the engineered Heatsink Launcher.  The sole advantage of the engineered Heatsink Launcher is that it increases reload time only to 15 s, rather than 17.5 s.

## Purchase Locations

This is the most common item in the game. Most stations with outfitting have this item. Almost all if not all industrial stations have this item.(Not avaliable on console 3.8 anymore )

New location is V886 Centauri near Musashi station.
