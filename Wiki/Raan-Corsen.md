**Raan Corsen**, also known as **CMDR Falchion**, is an independent pilot and a former employee of MetaDrive Inc. In 3302, Corsen competed in the annual Melee Masters Arena Championship in an F63 Condor and won the title. Later that year, Corsen inadvertently became involved in a conspiracy in which MetaDrive founder and chairman Femi Dakarai was assassinated to allow Sirius Corporation to acquire the company. When Corsen found himself a target of the conspiracy, he absconded with Dakarai's Imperial Eagle and fled, then faked his own death by crashing the ship into the surface of Alioth A 4. He eventually joined up with Tsu Annabelle Singh, Yuri Nakamura, and Kahina Tijani Loren, who sought to expose the conspiracy's masterminds. Corsen flew a Fer-de-Lance called the *Rivincita*.^[1]^

## Timeline

04 MAY 3303

- Imperial despatches have confirmed that Commander Salomé, also known as Kahina Tijani Loren, was killed in the Arumclaw system on the 29th of April by a bounty hunter known as 'Besieger'. Salomé was escorted by several heavily armed vessels, but her Imperial Clipper 'Seven Veils' was nevertheless destroyed by weapons fire. Three commanders were seen fleeing Arumclaw shortly afterwards. Surveillance reports indicate that Salomé's co-conspirators – Raan Corsen, Tsu Annabelle Singh and Yuri Nakamura – remain at large. Moments after Salomé's destruction was confirmed, a transmission was detected in the Teorge system, leading to the discovery of a series of logs. The logs, which apparently date from 3275, contain nebulous assertions regarding a scheme from an unidentified super organisation to manipulate the Empire, Federation and Alliance. A number of factions tried to defend Salomé and her allies as they travelled from 46 Eridani to the core systems. Imperial intelligence is reportedly trying to identify the factions that supported the conspirators, but anecdotal reports indicate that many have already fallen into disarray in the wake of Salomé's death. "She was a force of evil who attempted to sow the seeds of conflict among those who strive for peace," said Princess Aisling Duval. "Her warmongering is at an end, and the galaxy is now a safer place. It's just a shame that so many innocent lives were lost before she was brought down." Admiral Denton Patreus refused to address claims that the bounty hunter was in his employ, saying only, "Let that be an end to this sorry affair".^[2]^

08 APR 3303

- A weak signal from the Col 70 Sector has been detected by listening posts in both Federal and Imperial space. The message is incomplete, but it appears to pertain to some kind of rally point. Meanwhile, Federal and Imperial intelligence services have confirmed that thousands of covert and coded messages have recently been transmitted in the vicinity of the Col 70 Sector. "Something is going on out there," said an unidentified member of the Imperial intelligence community. "We think it could be...her." A bounty has been issued for Commanders Salomé, Tsu Annabelle Singh and Raan Corsen, but with all three fugitives still at large, the Empire has increased the bounties to five million for Salomé and two million apiece for Singh and Corsen. An Imperial spokesperson reiterated that pilots should not attempt to communicate with these individuals, and should shoot on sight. Imperial intelligence services have also placed a bounty on one Commander Yuri Nakamura, referred to as 'Conformist Oboe XX' in an intelligence briefing given to the media. A two- million-credit bounty has been placed on Commander Nakamura.^[3]^

24 MAR 3303

- Three of the five individuals responsible for the recent theft of meta-alloys from Darnielle's Progress have been positively identified, following analysis of starport security footage. Remarkably, one of the perpetrators has been acknowledged as Commander Salomé, also known as Kahina Tijani Loren. Loren was sentenced to life imprisonment last year for the attempted murder of Admiral Denton Patreus, but when her convoy was destroyed en route to Koontz Asylum it was assumed she had been killed. Responding to the news, Imperial authorities promptly placed a galaxy-wide bounty on Salomé to the tune of 500,000 credits. Meanwhile, Princess Aisling Duval released a brief statement: "Commander Salomé is a disgraced senator and a convicted murderer. She incites violence wherever she goes, and in the interest of public safety she must be stopped. I urge all those loyal to the Empire to deliver justice to this criminal." Salomé's accomplices have been identified as former MetaDrive employee Raan Corsen – previously believed deceased – and former Junior Alliance operative Tsu Annabelle Singh. The Empire has placed sizeable bounties on both individuals. Imperial military sources issued the following advice to those interested in pursuing these bounties: "These individuals should be considered armed and dangerous. Make no attempt to communicate with them. Shoot on sight. Visual evidence of a target's death will guarantee the relevant bounty." Salomé's current location is unknown, but she is believed to have fled the core systems.^[4]^

19 NOV 3302

- The independent audit of defunct technology company MetaDrive Inc. has now reached an end and, other than a few minor items, the acquisition of all remaining assets has been completed. One such item is the Imperial Eagle of the company's late chairman Femi Dakarai, which was owned by MetaDrive. In a strange turn of events, the ship was stolen by former MetaDrive employee Raan Corsen, who disappeared shortly after the audit began. A number of files relating to Dakarai's affairs are also believed to be missing. A junior member of the audit team reported that a series of so-called 'exodus documents' could not be located. The employee was unceremoniously removed from the audit team shortly afterwards. A spokesperson for BigSix, the auditor, provided a statement: "The audit of MetaDrive is now complete, and contrary to previous misleading reports, we have all the documentation we need. It transpires the Eagle spacecraft stolen by Raan Corsen crashed somewhere in the Alioth system while fleeing security forces. The vessel was fully insured, so BigSix is not unduly concerned by its loss."^[5]^

22 OCT 3302

- Board members of MetaDrive Inc. today announced the sale of MetaDrive Inc. to the Sirius Corporation. Rosaline Merden, acting Chair of MetaDrive, was clearly pleased with the outcome. At a press conference, she said: "The board of MetaDrive wholeheartedly welcomes the security this acquisition brings. As part of the Sirius Corporation, the MetaDrive brand will continue to go from strength to strength." Reporters asked about the ongoing audit of MetaDrive, and also the fate of former employee Raan Corsen, who was reported missing a couple of weeks ago. "The audit has been successfully completed and all assets are in the hands of Sirius Corporation," said Merden. "Raan Corsen's employment was terminated prior to the takeover." Merden was challenged by a representative of the Earth Defence Fleet, who alleged that Raan Corsen had in fact fled from Sirius security forces and been killed in the Alioth system. "Mr Corsen's business in the Alioth system was his own," said Merden. "It has nothing to do with the Sirius Corporation." The press conference closed with outstanding questions, but reporters managed to get a final word from Commander MoonWeb of the Earth Defence Fleet. "According to our intel, Corsen was pursued before crash-landing on a planet in the Alioth system. This was observed by Commander Ashley Wilkinson, a Canonn representative working with the Earth Defence Fleet. The specifics surrounding Corsen's demise are not known, but we have a transcript of his final transmission that points a finger squarely at the Sirius Corporation."^[6]^

23 SEP 3302

- Sad news from the Chi Orionis system this morning with reports that Femi Dakarai, chairman of the hyperdrive-research company MetaDrive Inc., has passed away following a short illness. Dakarai was taken ill last week after working tirelessly to secure financial backing for the company. Board members reported that he was working long hours and had been showing signs of stress for several months. An assessment of MetaDrive Inc. by an independent auditing firm appears to have been the final straw. "We should have acted sooner, but we were working extremely hard," said Rosaline Merden, company secretary. "With the company set to deliver on some very exciting technology in the coming year, it's particularly tragic. We will carry on in his memory." Board members were quick to pay their respects, and according to unofficial sources have made a generous payment to the Dakarai family on behalf of MetaDrive Inc. In related news, Raan Corsen, a junior employee of MetaDrive Inc., was recently suspended from the company after auditors detected account irregularities. Security forces in the Chi Orionis system, recently brought under the control of the Earth Defense Fleet, have asked the public to report any sightings of Corsen. MetaDrive Inc. has become something of a poster child for the depression currently affecting stock markets. Economic forecasts remain gloomy, with little prospect of improvement on the horizon.^[7]^
