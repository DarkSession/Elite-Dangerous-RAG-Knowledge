## Notes

- Players who start a new game in *Elite Dangerous*, own *Elite Dangerous: Horizons*, and choose to begin pilot training in Dromi will first spawn at Mawson Dock with a loan Sidewinder MkI and the Pilots' Federation District Permit.
- Before the addition of the Pilots' Federation District in the April Update, Dromi was an uninhabited system named Manu.
- If a player starts in the Dromi system, then later loses their ship and chooses to respawn in a loaned Sidewinder rather than rebuy their ship, they will respawn in the AY Indi system since they no longer have access to Dromi.
