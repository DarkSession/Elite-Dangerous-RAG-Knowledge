The Engineers
 		 	 

The **Engineers** are secretive, eccentric individuals who can modify the weapons and modules of ships to exceed baseline performance standards. As they reside in Workshops on planetary surfaces, they are only accessible to ships equipped with a Planetary Approach Suite. The modifications that Engineers offer vary depending upon their skill sets and personal preferences. Some Engineers will be more beneficial for explorers, while others will be more beneficial for combat specialists.

## Engineers and Workshops

Pilots will initially learn about some Engineers through rumors, but as they gain access to Engineers and build reputations, those Engineers will inform them of other Engineers with a wider variety of or more potent modifications. In order to obtain an invitation to an Engineer's workshop, their invite requirements (listed as "How to Get Invite" in table below) must first be met. These requirements vary and some Engineers are easier to obtain an invite from than others. Be aware that attempting to land at a workshop without an invitation is treated as trespassing, and offenders will be immediately attacked by the workshop's defences. Once invited and having traveled to their workshop, an Engineer's services can be unlocked by completing an additional task, ranging from providing a specific item to turning in bounties. 

When docked at a workshop, pilots can access an engineer's services through ship services. If they own Odyssey, they may also disembark and speak with the engineer in an auxillary workshop near the hangar.

### Ship Engineers

### Engineer unlock sequence

Initially, commanders are aware of a subset of Engineers from public knowledge. As commanders improve their reputation with these Engineers, they will unlock referrals to other, more selective Engineers who offer further sets of modifications. For example, to gain access to Lori Jameson, a commander must first develop reputation with Elvira Martuuk to earn a referral to Marco Qwent, then develop reputation with Qwent to earn a referral to Jameson.

| Publicly Known Engineers | ExpandReferrals | ExpandReferrals |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Elvira Martuuk | Mel Brandon<br>Zacariah Nemo |
| Marco Qwent | Chloe Sedesi<br>Lori Jameson<br>Professor Palin |
| Felicity Farseer | Juri Ishmaak | Colonel Bris Dekker<br>The Sarge |
| Liz Ryder | Etienne Dorn |
| Hera Tani | Broo Tarquin<br>Tiana Fortune |
| The Dweller | Marsha Hicks |
| Lei Cheung | Ram Tah |

## Engineer Ranks

Upon unlocking the services of a ship-focused Engineer, a pilot can begin accruing reputation with that Engineer to unlock higher grades of modifications. Reputation is measured in 5 tiers, with tier 5 representing the maximum level. Each modification that a pilot purchases will increase their reputation; low-grade modifications provide a smaller reputation boost than high-grade modifications, and each reputation tier requires more and more reputation to progress. With some Engineers, reputation can also be increased by selling commodities, exploration data, or bounty vouchers at their Workshops. It should be noted that Engineers may not be able to craft all 5 modification grades for a module type.

| Engineer Reputation Level | Required Profit |
| --- | --- |
| Grade 1 | *Unlocked as soon as Engineer task has been completed* |
| --- | --- |
| Grade 2 | Selling Exploration data/Commodities with a net profit of 500,000 Credits |
| --- | --- |
| Grade 3 | Selling Exploration data/Commodities with a net profit of 2,000,000 Credits |
| --- | --- |
| Grade 4 | Selling Exploration data/Commodities with a net profit of 8,000,000 Credits |
| --- | --- |
| Grade 5 | Selling Exploration data/Commodities with a net profit of 16,000,000 Credits |
| --- | --- |

Engineers that focus on pilot equipment do not use a reputation unlock system, and offer all of their modifications immediately upon fulfilling their meeting requirements.

## Crafting

    - *For a list of upgrades, see Category:Engineer Upgrades.*

### Ship Modifications

Materials are required by the Engineers to upgrade modules on the player's ship. Each blueprint specifies which materials are needed, and how to get them; material sources include (but are not limited to) destroyed ships, mission rewards, ship/wake scans, signal sources, mining, planetary surface resources, and more. Different Engineers require different materials, meaning not all materials gathered can be used by the same Engineer. Up to one blueprint can be pinned per Engineer; pinned modifications can be crafted at any station equipped with a Remote Workshop, but a modification crafted remotely will not contribute to reputation with its Engineer. Players can only pin 1 blueprint per Engineer for use at Remote Workshops.

Before upgrading a module, an information screen lists the materials needed for the modification, and the range for applied effects. Negative effects are static for a given grade and will only increase with higher grades, while positive effects increase per grade as more materials are spent on them. Eventually, a grade will be increased to a maximum value, at which point the only way to upgrade that modification further is to advance to the next grade. As modifications are purchased, reputation with the Engineer increases, unlocking access higher grades of modifications.

Grades must be progressed through consecutively from 1 to 5; however, you do *not* need to complete a grade to advance to the next one. As soon as then next grade becomes unlocked, you can immediately advance to it. The previous grade will autocomplete, so you will not lose out on any potency by skipping.^[1]^

It is not possible to immediately apply a Grade 5 modification to a module unless the module already has a Grade 5 legacy modification from before 3.0. Legacy modifications can converted into 3.0 modifications, but will be reduced in quality by one grade in the process.

While a modification is applied to a module, an additional quantity of materials can be spent to apply a single Experimental Effect to further enhance the module. Experimental Effects are only available at Engineer Workshops, and cannot be applied remotely.

Please note that only one Engineering modification can be installed per module. Installing a new modification will overwrite the old modification as well as the currently applied Experimental Effect permanently. It is only possible to obtain modules with two modifications under certain circumstances. This limitation should not be confused with the number of stat changes and effects a modification has, as these are determined by the particular modification and can be numerous.

### Pilot Equipment Modifications

Modifications for Suits and Handheld Weapons are applied differently from ship modifications. All Suits and Handheld Weapons can be upgraded to have up to four modification slots. While equipment can occasionally be purchased with preinstalled modifications at Pioneer Supplies stores, the most straightforward way of installing a specific mod into a specific piece of gear is to seek out the Engineer who specializes in that mod. 

Suits and handheld weapons need to be grade 2 or higher before you can modify them.^[2]^

Equipment mods offered by Engineers are purchased with a selection of Components, Data, and Goods, and a payment of Credits. Unlike ship mods, equipment mods are only available in a single quality grade, and require only a single transaction with the Engineer to fully apply it. Once a mod is installed on a particular Suit or Handheld Weapon, it cannot be removed or replaced by another mod.

### Method

Engineering suits and handheld weapons is a very slow and tedious grind. Recommended is to visit random stations and go to the Pioneer Supplies store in the Concourse to check if premium suits and weapons are available. Because this is much faster and easier than engineering. Each PS store has a limited amount of exclusive, premium items per location. They are sold out if another player bought them earlier. However, the PS stores restock every week (usually on Thursday).

## Pre-Engineered modules

Pre-Engineered modules were introduced as rewards for Community Goals and limited-time events. These modules may feature two Engineering modifications at once, modifications that cannot normally be applied to the specific module, or unique modifications that are not offered by any Engineer. Occasionally, pre-Engineered modules are later made available for purchase through Technology Brokers.

Pre-Engineered modules come with some restrictions:

- Modules with two modifications will lose their second modification if another modification is applied.
- In some cases, Experimental Effects can be added or changed without affecting the modifications.^[3]^^[4]^^[5]^ Pre-Engineered modules that normally have no Engineering options, such as Guardian technology modules or mining tools, are unable to accept any Experimental Effects.

## Development

Engineers were introduced in the *Elite Dangerous: Horizons* 2.1 update. Engineering mechanics were overhauled and improved with *Elite Dangerous: Beyond* Chapter One (3.0).

4 Engineers based in the Colonia Region were added in *Beyond* Chapter Three (3.2). 1 Engineer based in the Witch Head Nebula was added by the Interstellar Initiative The Enclave. 9 Engineers specialising in Suit and Handheld Weapon modifications were added in *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*. 4 more Engineers specialising in Suit and Handheld Weapon modifications were added to the Colonia Region in *Odyssey* Update 8.

### Engineering rebalance

  	 	 			  

In the Type-8 update (18.08), an engineering rebalance was introduced. Changes included increasing the amount of materials one would typically get from completing missions, as well as increasing material availability at Grade 4/5 farming locations by increasing the number of sources of materials and in some cases, payout per source.

One of the more notable changes introduced with this rebalance is the change to engineering rolls. In the past, engineering rolls towards ship hardpoints/modules would gain a random amount of progress, influenced towards higher percentages of progress depending on your access level with the engineer providing the modification. 

The rebalance changes the behavior of rolls from a random percentage of progress gained to an exact amount of progress gained, with access level influence still present. **This means for achieving a grade of modification for any module, there is now always an exact number of rolls needed to achieve full progress for that grade, scaling downwards with the access level you have for that engineer.** 

The below table illustrates the new rolling system:

Progress Percentage Gained Towards a Modification, Per Roll
|  |  | Access Level with Engineer | Access Level with Engineer | Access Level with Engineer | Access Level with Engineer | Access Level with Engineer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Modification Grade | Grade 1 | 20% | 25% | 34% | 50% | 100% |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Grade 2 | X | 20% | 25% | 34% | 50% |
| Grade 3 | X | X | 20% | 25% | 34% |
| Grade 4 | X | X | X | 20% | 25% |
| Grade 5 | X | X | X | X | 20% |
