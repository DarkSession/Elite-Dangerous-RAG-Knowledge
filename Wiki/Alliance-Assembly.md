# Alliance Assembly
The **Alliance Assembly** is the governing body of the Alliance. Its members are called Councillors. The Assembly's function is to establish common policies and treaties rather than laws among the Alliance's member systems. It acts as an arbitration body when necessary and lacks law making powers. Depending on Assembly votes it can enforce sanctions or corrective measures. The politics of the member states often makes this a tricky process.^[1]^^[2]^

## Functions

The Councillors of the Alliance Assembly represent each member state of the Alliance. The number of Councillors within the Alliance Assembly is based on the size of each member state's respective populations; some members only have one. When the ruling minor faction of a member state changes, then depending on the rules of that member state, it could change who represents them in the Assembly. The meetings of the Alliance Assembly are conducted virtually in the Parliament, which is run in Garden City on Turner's World in Alioth.^[3]^^[4]^

The head of the Alliance Assembly is the Alliance Prime Minister, who is elected by the Assembly by a plurality vote and can be removed from that position by a vote of no confidence. The Prime Minister's duties involve corralling the Councillors into a consensus, a tedious process given the Alliance's significant cultural variation.^[1]^^[3]^^[5]^

The Assembly is considerably less bound to tradition than Federal Congress or the Imperial Senate. Procedures are still subject to change, arguments frequently occur, anything rarely gets done. Consequently, the Alliance is largely run by Civil Servants in practice.^[3]^

The Alliance Assembly does not govern the Alliance Defence Force. Instead, the ADF is commanded by the Council of Admirals, which has the authority to take military action without prior approval from the Assembly. However, the Assembly retains the power to approve new members of Council,^[6]^ and the Council is required to report on and account for its decisions to the Assembly after any military action.^[3]^ On rare occasions, the Council will participate in a joint session with the Assembly to vote on certain issues relevant to the Alliance's security.^[7]^

## Trivia

- While parallels can be drawn with the European Union in the 21st century, the Assembly lacks the law making powers of the EU. It mainly functions as a means for establishing common policies and treaties rather than laws.^[2]^
