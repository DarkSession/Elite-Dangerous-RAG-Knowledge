A **Distress Call** is a type of signal source that is a variant of the Weapons Fire signal source. It can sometimes serve as a Mission Target USS for Assassinate Pirate Lord missions.

## Signal Contents

A Distress Call will randomly generate different content:

- A trader who has run out of fuel. Pirates may also be present. You can refuel the ship as follows:
    1. Install a Fuel Transfer Limpet Controller.
    2. Buy or synthesize a few limpets (**Note:** they take up cargo space).
    3. Setup a fire group for the Fuel Transfer Limpet Controller.
    4. Target the ship and press the appropriate fire button. 1t of fuel can be enough for a ship to jump to the nearest system.
- A heavily damaged trader who is under attack from pirates. The pirates will respond if engaged, and will attack in several waves of increasing difficulty.
- A heavily damaged trader who needs a Hull Repair. Use Repair Limpets.
- A debris field and several Search and Rescue ships.
- A Federal Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser under pirate attack.
- Several heavily armed ships (usually Anacondas) piloted by high ranking pirates who have faked a distress signal in order to attack any pilot who responds.
- A destroyed Majestic-Class Interdictor with its fleet and a Thargoid ship can be found in the HR 1185 system.
- A destroyed Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser with its fleet and a Thargoid Cyclops can be found in the HIP 17044 system.
- A vessel that requests Food Commodities.
