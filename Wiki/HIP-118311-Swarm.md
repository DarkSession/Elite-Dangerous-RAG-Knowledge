> Swarm is the codename of the weaponised form of the tiny but lethally poisonous biting insects native to HIP 118311. Manipulated by a control fluid, the weapons can be targeted onto enemy positions using a remote electromagnetic beam, then unleashed to wreak chaos and death on enemy ranks. The weapon’s trademark buzzing quickly made it a favourite with crime syndicates, favoured for intimidation and enforcement purposes. Banned in most jurusdictions.
