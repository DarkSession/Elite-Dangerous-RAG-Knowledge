# Wide Angle Sensors
**Wide Angle Sensors** is an engineer modification that can be applied to sensors. It widens the target area in which you can scan at the cost of increased power draw, and decreased sensor range.

It is available in 5 grades, with the highest grade offering up to 200% wider scan angle.
