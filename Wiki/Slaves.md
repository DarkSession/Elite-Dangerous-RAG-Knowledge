Unlike Imperial Slaves, which are regulated and protected by Imperial Slavery laws within the Empire, conventional slaves are individuals who have been involuntarily forced into slavery or have grown up in service. They are traded between largely unscrupulous and uncaring individuals, and are coerced into servitude with threats of torture or deadly force. A significant number of slaves are the result of black market trading in Occupied Escape Pods obtained through piracy. Conventional slaves have no status or legal protection, and are generally considered expendable property by their owners.^[1]^
