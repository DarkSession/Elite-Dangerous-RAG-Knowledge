**Yuri Nakamura**, also known as **CMDR Conformist Oboe XX**, is an independent pilot who once served with distinction in the Federal Navy before retiring and becoming a full-time CQC pilot. He competed in the 3302 Melee Masters Arena Championship using a custom Eagle MkII and made it to the final match, but ultimately lost to Raan Corsen. The following year, Corsen solicited Nakamura's help in protecting Kahina Tijani Loren from bounty hunters and assassins while she traveled from 46 Eridani to Teorge to expose a shadowy cabal. During that mission, Nakamura flew his personal Imperial Courier, the *Sword of Damocles*.^[1]^

## Timeline

04 MAY 3303

- Imperial despatches have confirmed that Commander Salomé, also known as Kahina Tijani Loren, was killed in the Arumclaw system on the 29th of April by a bounty hunter known as 'Besieger'. Salomé was escorted by several heavily armed vessels, but her Imperial Clipper 'Seven Veils' was nevertheless destroyed by weapons fire. Three commanders were seen fleeing Arumclaw shortly afterwards. Surveillance reports indicate that Salomé's co-conspirators – Raan Corsen, Tsu Annabelle Singh and Yuri Nakamura – remain at large. Moments after Salomé's destruction was confirmed, a transmission was detected in the Teorge system, leading to the discovery of a series of logs. The logs, which apparently date from 3275, contain nebulous assertions regarding a scheme from an unidentified super organisation to manipulate the Empire, Federation and Alliance. A number of factions tried to defend Salomé and her allies as they travelled from 46 Eridani to the core systems. Imperial intelligence is reportedly trying to identify the factions that supported the conspirators, but anecdotal reports indicate that many have already fallen into disarray in the wake of Salomé's death. "She was a force of evil who attempted to sow the seeds of conflict among those who strive for peace," said Princess Aisling Duval. "Her warmongering is at an end, and the galaxy is now a safer place. It's just a shame that so many innocent lives were lost before she was brought down." Admiral Denton Patreus refused to address claims that the bounty hunter was in his employ, saying only, "Let that be an end to this sorry affair".^[2]^

08 APR 3303

- A weak signal from the Col 70 Sector has been detected by listening posts in both Federal and Imperial space. The message is incomplete, but it appears to pertain to some kind of rally point. Meanwhile, Federal and Imperial intelligence services have confirmed that thousands of covert and coded messages have recently been transmitted in the vicinity of the Col 70 Sector. "Something is going on out there," said an unidentified member of the Imperial intelligence community. "We think it could be...her." A bounty has been issued for Commanders Salomé, Tsu Annabelle Singh and Raan Corsen, but with all three fugitives still at large, the Empire has increased the bounties to five million for Salomé and two million apiece for Singh and Corsen. An Imperial spokesperson reiterated that pilots should not attempt to communicate with these individuals, and should shoot on sight. Imperial intelligence services have also placed a bounty on one Commander Yuri Nakamura, referred to as 'Conformist Oboe XX' in an intelligence briefing given to the media. A two- million-credit bounty has been placed on Commander Nakamura.^[3]^
