> A collection of highly illegal AI remnants. These items are of extreme interest to various shady organisations and remote cults. Their almost mythical status has led to a huge amount of counterfeiting, further inflating the value of items with a clear and proven history. It is uncertain whether any of these pieces actually retain the AI personality that was originally present within.

*ALERT: AI Relics are illegal in most systems.*

## Acquisition

AI Relics are found in Strong Signal Sources where Anaconda Pirates use them as a trap. When you attempt to scoop the AI Relic, 2-3 Anacondas will jump in and ambush you. Some dialog occurs when this happens.

The easiest way for the player to acquire AI Relics is by pirating them from "Private Courier Service" NPCs that spawn in high-security, high-tech systems that are in a boom state.

## Location

AI Relics can be found in any system with Degraded Emissions or Encoded Emissions Signal Sources. Examples of systems where they have been previously found include Maia, Meiri, RR Caeli, Tabaldak, Bunda, CD-68 29, and Xuan Wena.
