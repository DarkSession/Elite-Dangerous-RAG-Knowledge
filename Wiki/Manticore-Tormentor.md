## Overview

The **Manticore Tormentor** is a heavy, powerful, slow-firing plasma sidearm, fulfilling the role of a "hand cannon" or similar weapon in other games. It is fairly effective against both shields and health, but its relatively low rate of fire, low ammo capacity of just six shots (nine if modified with Magazine Size), and fairly short effective range limit its utility. Like all plasma weapons, it has a fairly noticeable pellet travel time as well.

It is most useful for quickly finishing off weaker opponents, or as a deadly "panic button" at closer ranges. The Stability mod dramatically reduces recoil, making the Tormentor more effective at longer ranges.
