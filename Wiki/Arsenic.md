## Tips

Visit the crashed Anaconda on Orrere 2B (CRUSHED SHIP point of interest), collect the grade 4 raw materials there. Trade down at a material trader for arsenic. This should get you plenty of arsenic since it's a grade 2 material.^[1]^

Brain Trees also have arsenic. Such as in SYNUEFE NU-M D8-37, Planet A 1.^[1]^
