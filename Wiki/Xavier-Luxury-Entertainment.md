## Notes

- Xavier Luxury Entertainment's logo includes mention of a place called "Parriz". Based on *Elite Dangerous* concept art used to represent a typical Alliance city, Parriz appears to be a city on an Earth-like World. However, the closest thing to an Earth-like World in the Koyeris system, where the corporation's minor faction originates, is the Water World Koyeris A 1.
