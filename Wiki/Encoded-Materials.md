# Encoded Materials
- *Not to be confused with Data.*

    - *Main article: Materials*

**Encoded Materials** (aka Data) is a type of material gathered by scanning various technological sources and used in Engineer blueprints. It is stored in a dedicated data store with a maximum of 500 units.

## Encoded Material Sources

Encoded Materials can be acquired by scanning suitable source types:

### Ships

Target any ship (either in Supercruise or sub-light speeds) and centre it in your field of view. Your ship will scan it automatically, and sometimes you will receive data, typically shield or emissions-related.

### Private Data Beacons

Found in Degraded Emissions and Encoded Emissions amongst destroyed ship debris.

### Satellites

Found in Encoded Emissions around populated Earthlike worlds, or at some installations.

### Planetary Outposts

Planetary outposts (not Starports) typically have 1 or more data points that can be scanned with your SRV's Data Link Scanner. They come in 3 security levels (Low, Medium, High) and 3 sizes (Small '+', Medium '++', and Large '+++').

Higher security outposts provide rarer data, but also have stronger defences.

### Ancient Ruins / Guardian Structures

Ancient Guardian ruins on the surfaces of certain planets are the sole source of Guardian-related data and materials. Obelisks at Ancient Ruins can be scanned by an SRV in order to acquire the various types of Obelisk Pattern Data (Alpha, Beta, etc.), whilst an Ancient Data Terminal can yield Blueprint Segments.

Unlike most other types of Data, Guardian Data Types cannot be acquired or spent through trade at Material Traders.

### Surface Scan Missions

Some missions will require you to scan the data point of a nearby small settlement not otherwise listed in your navigation panel. These settlements can only be found as mission targets, and the data point scan will often produce rare and very rare data.

### Wakes

Frame shift drive wakes are a source of frame shift related data. You must scan the wake with a Frame Shift Wake Scanner to retrieve this data.

### Mission Rewards

Some missions offer data as part of the mission rewards. It is difficult to predict what missions are available at starports, let alone predict what data will be provided as a reward, so it is not recommended that you rely on these when looking for specific data types. Nevertheless, they are a useful way to acquire data when not looking for specific data types.
