**Degraded Emissions** are a type of signal source, and are one of the most common signal types found anywhere. Even unpopulated systems will occasionally spawn Degraded Emissions.

Degraded Emissions can act as the mission site for various types of Recovery mission (e.g. Black Box, Rare Artwork).

## Signal Contents

Degraded Emissions can generate different content:

| Threat Level | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| Any | <ul><li>Mission Salvage. If acting as the mission site for a Recovery mission, the site will include the requested items and potentially additional miscellaneous items. These sites can occasionally spawn with a threat rating - when this happens, a group of pirates will jump in shortly after arrival and proceed to attack. When flying an Anaconda, the pirate wave will typically be one larger ship (such as an Anaconda, Fer-de-Lance, etc.) backed up by 3-5 smaller ships like Sidewinders and Eagle MkIIs.</li>
<li>Search and Rescue (SAR) ships. The SAR ships will proceed to scoop any cargo present.</li></ul> |
