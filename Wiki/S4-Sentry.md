Comes as standard with a belly-mounted standard recoil-ready small weapon mount, which will take both kinetic and thermal weapons.

The **S4 Sentry** (aka Sentry Skimmer) is a remote-control Skimmer by Core Dynamics. It is commonly used for security operations at Settlements and Surface Ports, though it can sometimes be found protecting remote cargo dumps. 

## Overview

The Sentry patrols an assigned area or remains buried underground until an intruder approaches. The Sentry is quite fragile thus highly reliant on its small size and rapid maneuverability to avoid incoming fire.

The vast majority of S4 Sentry Skimmers are armed with a light Multi-cannon. Some models at higher-security installations may be armed with pulse or burst lasers. Laser-armed S4s are often also fitted with a shield generator which enhances their limited durability.
