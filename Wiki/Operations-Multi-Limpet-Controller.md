The **Operations Multi Limpet Controller** is a Limpet Controller that can program limpets with the Collector, Hatch Breaker, or Recon functions as needed. Although it is more flexible than the specialised modules it combines, it is only available in a small size, is less efficient, and has significantly greater mass.

## Usage

The Operations Multi Limpet Controller combines the functions of the Collector Limpet Controller, Hatch Breaker Limpet Controller, and Recon Limpet Controller into a single module, making it well-suited for piracy, salvage, and search and rescue activities. The convenience of this is offset by the module's lack of size options, preventing it from being equipped on any ships that do not possess a Class 3 or larger Internal Compartment, and its increased mass.
