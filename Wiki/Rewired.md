**Rewired** is an independent newsfeed that is known for its prodigious output, sometimes releasing hundreds of stories a day. Balancing such productivity with thorough fact checking is a tall order, however, and the feed's critics sometimes claim that at least half its output consists of redactions, corrections, and apologies. Despite these jibes, only the most obdurate critic would deny that Rewired has broken major stories in the past, with its guerrilla-style approach allowing it to react faster than some of its larger, more established rivals.^[1]^

In August 3307, Rewired entered into an agreement with the Engineer Kit Fowler to broadcast his conspiracy theory show "End Times".^[2]^
