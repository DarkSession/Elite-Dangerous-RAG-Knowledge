**NGC 1514**, also known as the Crystal Ball Nebula, is a planetary nebula in the Inner Orion Spur generated by the BD+30 623 star. Discovered in 1790 by William Herschel, he described it as "A most singular phenomenon". Up close, it is even more. The nebula glows blue around in the light from the Class B star.
