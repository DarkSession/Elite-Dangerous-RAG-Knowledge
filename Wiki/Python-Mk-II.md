# Python Mk II
> 
> 
> Manufactured by Faulcon deLacy, the Python Mk II is a redesign of an iconic vessel. Reimagined as a combat ship that sacrifices internal space for increased manoeuvrability, firepower and defensce. With six hardpoints, it can go head-to-head with larger ships, while its improved agility allows it to handle smaller vessels without having to rely on turret weapons. The redesigned hull offers superior management of overcharged Frame Shift Drives.

## Overview

There are 2 variants: Standard and Stellar. The Stellar version is listed in the Pre-Built Ships section via the main menu. The Standard variant has nearly identical Outfitting as normal ships. The Stellar variant is equipped by default with four Multi-Cannons and two Pulse Lasers.

The Mk II is highly lethal in combat. It comes with six hardpoint slots, four of which are Class 3 and the remainder Class 2s, making its potential damage output more akin to a large ship. This combined with its maneuverability makes the Python Mk II exceptionally well suited for combat activities such as Piracy, Bounty Hunting, Assassination, and Xeno Hunting.

The Mk II can carry a maximum of 96 t of cargo, which is dwarfed by the 294 t cargo capacity of the Mk I, making the Mk II much less effective for activities such as trading or mining compared to its predecessor. 

The Mk II has a higher default unladen jump range of 18.11 ly versus the Mk I's 8.25 ly due to the 5C SCO-capable Frame Shift Drive coming preinstalled. When equipped with identical FSDs, the Mk II and Mk I have very similar jump ranges—19.93 ly and 19.48 ly, respectively. However, when outfitted for jump range, the difference is much larger—26.71 ly and 31.63 ly. The gap widens even more dramatically when engineering is added to the equation.

The Mk II was designed from the ground up for supercruise overcharge, giving it much better handling, less thermal load, less fuel consumption, and better acceleration and deceleration while using SCO compared to all previous ships.

## Development

The Python Mk II was the first new ship added to Elite Dangerous since the addition of the Mamba in 2018. Frontier announced in a Frontier Unlocked livestream that the Mk II will be added with a free update in 2024.  Elite partners got early access on a test server on 1 May 2024.^[1]^ This ship became available for early access for 16,250 ARX on 7 May 2024. It became available for purchase using in-game credits on 7 Aug 2024.
