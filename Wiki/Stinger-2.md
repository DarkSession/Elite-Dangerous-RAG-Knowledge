> Achilles Corp Stinger-2 attack skimmer – Smaller and quicker than Core Dynamics offerings in this sector, and also cheaper to buy. It has no weapon mount, but carries explosives, and can be directed by its pilot to self destruct, taking out its target. Some installations use these skimmers to form a last line of defence for sensitive bases and outposts. In essence they are a flying bomb. The Achilles Corporation recently cut down its range of skimmers just to the Stinger-2, but it is rumoured they will be launching new skimmers in the next few years.

The **Stinger-2** (aka Stinger) is a remote-control Skimmer by Achilles Corporation. It is used for security operations at Settlements and Shipwrecks. 

## Overview

It patrols and defends a specific area against intruders. Unlike other Skimmers, the Stinger-2 is lightly armored and often unshielded. It attacks by homing in on an intruder and detonating itself in close proximity akin to a mobile mine.

Whilst the Stinger's suicide blast isn't particularly powerful, it *does* bypass the shields of SRVs. Their main purpose is thus attrition and harassment; they gradually wear down hostiles.
