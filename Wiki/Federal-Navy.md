## Overview

The modern iteration of the Federal Navy was established in 2702, while the Federation was embroiled in the Birthright Wars, a series of conflicts instigated by Federal corporations seeking to seize hereditary land and resource claims from colonists. Previously, the Federal Navy had been a more informal organisation in which Federal fleets were mustered directly from Federal member systems as the need arose, but the advent of interstellar corporations allowed the Federation to contract the construction and maintenance of centralised fleets. The first of these new Federal fleets was commissioned and trained in the Anlave system.^[1]^^[2]^ The Federal Navy is funded directly by the Federation, and used to project its values and influence.^[3]^

The Federal Navy was further enhanced in 2867 during the administration of President Olaf Smith. Smith sent a Federal fleet to investigate the Zelda system after several traders disappeared nearby. When more traders disappeared in Ququve and Aymiay, the Federation fortified the Laedla system into a major military hub to defend against an "alien threat". Smith's claims that he was "driving away the alien threat" made him immensely popular, although it was never proven if Thargoid or other alien activity was behind the disappearances, and a pirate known as "The Black Prince" claimed responsibility for the attacks years later.^[4]^^[5]^

In the 2970s, the Federal Navy embarked a terraforming project in the Eta Cassiopeiae system to build a new headquarters. The relocation from Anlave to Eta Cassiopeiae was completed in 2983.^[6]^

The President of the Federation is the Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Navy,^[7]^ and senior members of the Federal Navy advise the president on military matters.^[8]^ The head of the Federal Navy under the president is the Fleet Admiral, who is one of the president's advisors and attends Cabinet meetings. Currently, the position of Fleet Admiral is held by Tayo Maikori, who was appointed in January 3308.^[9]^

Following the shutdown of Aegis on January 18, 3308, its role in defending the superpowers from the Thargoids in the ongoing conflict devolved to each superpower's military force. As a result, Federal Congress ordered the creation of a new strike force under the Federal Navy that would be dedicated to anti-Thargoid operations.^[10]^

## Services

### Federal Navy Auxiliary

Commanders of the Pilots Federation can serve in the Federal Navy Auxiliary.^[11]^^[12]^^[13]^ This auxiliary force is an organised group that supplements the Federal Navy, but is not directly integrated. Honorary ranks, which take their names from ranks used by the Federal Navy proper, are rewarded to individuals for their service, but do not confer any of the associated authority. Instead, members of the Federal Navy Auxiliary who prove their dedication are granted permission to purchase certain Federal Navy ships and access important Federal star systems.

### Federal Marine Corps

The Federal Marine Corps is the infantry service of the Federal Navy. Members are known as Federal Marines.^[14]^^[15]^

### Federal Navy Engineering Corps

The Federal Navy Engineering Corps is the engineer service of the Federal Navy. A division of the Engineering Corps oversees the maintenance of Starship One.^[16]^

### Federal Navy Criminal Court
