**Giya Mastopolos** was an Imperial Senator, and the founder and CEO of Mastopolos Mining. His family originated from Achenar.^[1]^

In 2951, the major interest of Giya Mastopolos lay in solving an Imperial resource crisis and so he financed an expeditionary flotilla into the Zeaex system, empowering Erronsa and Francis Ashfield in their conflict over mining rights with Grambourne Cambridge of theÂ Federation.^[1]^ Giya later took direct control of the mining operations, and under his and his daughter Niya's guidance, Mastopolos Mining rapidly expanded. The company has been under the control of the Mastopolos dynasty ever since.
