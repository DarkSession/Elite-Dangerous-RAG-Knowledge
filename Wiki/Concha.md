## Distance

Minimum distance between two genetic samples: 150 m

## Conditions of occurrence

- Planets with thin Ammonia, Nitrogen, Water or Carbon Dioxide atmosphere
- Maximum gravity: 0.27

| ATMOSPHERE TYPE | SPECIES |
| --- | --- |
| Ammonia | Concha aureolas |

### Description

*This concha species resembles a ridged, bisected egg until they crack in half, allowing a thin stalk to sprout from its fleshy insides. This is covered with cloughnut—shaped pods that create locations for chemical exchange.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planet with thin Nitrogen atmosphere
- Maximum gravity: 0.27

### Colored variants

Colored variant determined by rare material found on planet:

| MATERIAL | COLOR |
| --- | --- |
| Antinomy | Peach |
| Polonium |  |
| Ruthenium | Orange |
| Technetium |  |
| Tellurium |  |
| Yttrium |  |
