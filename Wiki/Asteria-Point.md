# Asteria Point
Orbital Junction overview
 		 	 

**Asteria Point** is a CQC Championship arena. The main structure contains tunnel systems that can be used to shake off pursuers.^[1]^

## Notes

- Asteria Point is located in the Bleae Aewsy GA-Y d1-14 system in the orbit of planet 1, but cannot be directly accessed outside of a normal CQC match because there is no navigation marker for it.
