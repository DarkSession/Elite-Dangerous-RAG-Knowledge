> Core Dynamics Farragut-Class Battle Cruisers represent the cutting edge in military technology. A single FCB can carry several squadrons of Federal Fighters and multiple Federal Corvettes across hundreds of light years without any difficulty. These deep deployment capabilities, coupled with extraordinarily heavy firepower, practically guarantee that a single FCB will completely overpower all but the most well-equipped opponents.

The **Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser** is a battlecruiser manufactured by Core Dynamics exclusively for the Federation. As a capital ship, it serves as the backbone of the Federal Navy and the core of each of its fleets. In contrast with its Imperial Navy counterpart, the Majestic-Class Interdictor, the Farragut emphasises utility over style and comfort, and in a direct, one-on-one confrontation with the Imperial capital ship, the Farragut holds the advantage in terms of raw firepower and combat endurance.

## Overview

> 
> 
> The Federation's capital ships are brutal, practical war machines inside and out. Airtight doors split the interior into many separate compartments. Grab-handles abound, as do access panels and all the paraphernalia of a military vessel. There would be no mistaking a Federal ship's interior with an Imperial one.

The Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser is over two kilometers long, and heavily-armed with the following weaponry: 20 Federal Laser Turrets, 8 Federal Broadside Cannons, and 8 Capital Torpedo Launchers, and is equipped with hangars capable of transporting multiple smaller Federal military ships, such as Federal Dropships to be launched as low orbit bombers^[3]^ or even large Federal Corvettes^[1]^, and F63 Condor squadrons. It is equipped with a capital-class Frame Shift Drive^[4]^ with an undisclosed jump range. The Federal Navy uses the Farragut as an integral part of its Intervention Fleets, which are used to investigate and intervene in larger-scale conflicts.^[5]^

From 3278 to 3302, the construction of Farragut-Class Battle Cruisers as well as other capital ships was restricted by the terms of the London Treaty, which was created to prevent an arms race between the superpowers that was projected to occur with the introduction of the Frame Shift Drive. Imperial Senator and Fleet Admiral Denton Patreus publicly spurned the London Treaty on October 21, 3302 in a speech in which he declared he would build as many capital ships as the Empire needed for its defence, marking the Empire's withdrawal from the treaty and heralding its dissolution.^[6]^^[7]^

Since the outbreak of the Second Thargoid War in 3303, multiple Farragut-Class Battle Cruisers have been destroyed by Thargoid Interceptors due to the former's vulnerability to Thargoid shutdown fields. Since the anti-xeno countermeasures developed for smaller ships have proven prohibitively difficult to scale-up for capital ships, the international research and defence organisation Aegis has declared that capital ships are ineffective at protecting outposts, planets, and shipping lanes from Thargoid attacks at present. Instead, anti-Thargoid efforts have been spearheaded by militias of personal-scale craft.^[8]^^[9]^

During a period of increased tensions between the Federation and the Empire in late 3306 caused by the activities of the Neo-Marlinist Liberation Army, President Zachary Hudson convinced Federal Congress to approve a funding increase for the Federal Navy in order to expand production of Farragut-Class Battle Cruisers.^[10]^ With assistance from independent pilots, this resulted in five new Farraguts being fast-tracked for completion, with planned deployments in Atropos, Iman Caber, LHS 142, LFT 367, and Wolf 25.^[11]^

## Notes

- David Braben describes the Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser: *"...there will be no gravity, you'll just float around. Things like magnetic boots will make getting around very easy, and they wouldn't be great big clunky things like you might see on a diver. These would look like normal shoes but they'll have fancy technology that make them stick to the surfaces...the Federal ship is a lot more sort of Spartan, a lot more just practical warship essentially...the Federal ship's central section, and with design, one of the design briefs we've had, this is trying to design ships with their function in mind...For the Federal ship, it's utility that's important. The reason it's got this central corridor, this is where ships come out of their hangars and it's to try and protect the hangars from outside. So the reason they face inward and the ships fly out, you know they're already up to speed...that would be very very heavily protected and potentially with things like shields around it."*^[21]^
- All Farragut-Class Battle Cruisers appear to share the registration tag of FDN-RD5.
- The Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser cannot be destroyed by reducing its hull to 0%.^[22]^
- After destroying all of the Faragut's Heat Relays the ship will escape from battle by activating its Frame Shift Drive.^[23]^
- Routing the Farragut awards the player 500,000 CR.
- Most Capital Ships have an exclusion zone, and flying too close to one can provoke it into attacking even if the player is on friendly terms with its controlling faction. In these cases, the Capital Ship will issue warning messages to ships that invade its exclusion zone.

## Trivia

- The length of the Farragut-Class Battle Cruiser (2,040 meters) is roughly the same as six Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers (337 meters) lined up end to end.^[24]^
- The majority of Farragut-Class Battle Cruisers are named after past and present warships of the British Royal Navy.
- The Farragut most likely gets its name from David G. Farragut, the first American Admiral, for whom two U.S Navy destroyer classes have also been named.
