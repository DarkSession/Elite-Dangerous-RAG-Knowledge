# Plasma Slug
**Plasma Slug** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to Plasma Accelerators and Railguns through Engineering. It allows plasma slug ammo to be generated for the applicable weapons directly from ship fuel, at the cost of 10% reduced damage output per shot. Note that on Railguns, plasma slug will also reduce the heat generated by 40%. Plasma slug will always consume 0.022 tons of fuel for every shot in the magazine reloaded. 

As fuel can be freely scooped from stars, this upgrade effectively eliminates the ammunition restock costs for the Plasma Accelerator and Railgun. Ships with small fuel reserves should use caution as they could become stranded.
