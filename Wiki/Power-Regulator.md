A **Power Regulator** is a Good introduced in *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*. It is a vital component of settlement power reactors, without which the reactor cannot function and the settlement will be left without any power for its security systems. Some missions task the player with stealing an active settlement's Power Regulator, which requires shutting down the reactor first, or installing one at an inactive settlement to allow it to be repopulated.^[1]^^[2]^ Stolen Power Regulators are marked as Stolen Goods.^[3]^

## Notes

- Power Regulators were named "Reactor Regulators" in pre-alpha builds of *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*.
- Power Regulators can also rarely be found in wrecked SRVs or crashed ships, though typically Degraded Power Regulators are found in their place.
