## Usage

The Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser is a variant of the Shutdown Field Neutraliser, which is designed specifically to counteract the Thargoid Maelstroms' shockwave defense mechanism. Unlike the Shutdown Field Neutraliser, it has to be unlocked with materials and only one can be bought at a time with the same materials, rather than making the module permanently available to buy. It can be bought at all Rescue Megaships, and multiple must be unlocked with the same materials.

The Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser works in the same way as the Shutdown Field Neutraliser, where it has to be fully charged before the shockwave/shutdown field hits you. Unlike the Shutdown Field Neutraliser, this module has a longer charge-up time, and has a higher active distributor draw, and draws power even while it is charging up. This makes timing it with the Maelstrom shockwave harder, as the time the neutraliser is actually active is usually mere seconds before running out and needing to re-prime. If the neutraliser runs out of charge before the shockwave hits you, your ship will not be protected from the shockwave.

It is possible to encounter more than one shockwave on the way towards the core of the Maelstrom, where each should be countered using the Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser.

If the Thargoid Pulse Neutraliser is timed properly, the user's ship will start generating heat, possibly capable of getting a ship's heat levels above 300%, causing significant module damage. This damage can be mitigated with the use of Heatsink Launchers. Another option is to enter Silent Running. The amount of heat generated seems to vary and may be as low as 25% rise. This heat can also be used to burn off any remaining caustic substance from the outer Maelstrom, as the inner area around the Titan has no passive caustic damage.
