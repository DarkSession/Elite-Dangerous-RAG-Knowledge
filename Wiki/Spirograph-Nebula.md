Spirograph Nebula
 		 	 

The **Spirograph Nebula**, also known as **IC 418**, is a planetary nebula surrounding the BD-12 1172 system. It is located approximately between the Witch Head Nebula and Barnard's Loop, and is 1,100.02 ly away from Sol.

In October 3304, the Close Encounters Corps minor faction organised an initiative to construct a Megaship that would be used to map and research the Spirograph Nebula. The initiative succeeded, and resulted in the deployment of a new Sanchez-Class Science Vessel in BD-12 1172.^[1]^^[2]^
