A **Debris Field** is a persistent System Signal Source found in some systems. Debris Fields always contain a large cloud of wreckage, presumably from a battle or catastrophe, and occasionally junk commodities or some Manufactured Materials. Some Debris Fields may be patrolled by one or more Wings of non-hostile ships. Some debris fields may have pirates.
