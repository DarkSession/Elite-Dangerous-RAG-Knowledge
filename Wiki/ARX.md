## Earning ARX

Players can earn ARX through normal gameplay activities, such as exploring a new system, hauling cargo, or destroying other ships. Each activity rewards a small quantity of ARX, and a breakdown of recent earnings can be seen on the main menu. Logging-in to the game but remaining inactive will not earn any ARX, since none is rewarded based on time spent in-game. A maximum of 400 ARX can be earned per week.^[3]^ This limit seems to reset on Thursdays, around 07:00 (7 AM) UTC.

During the annual Festive Countdown event from December 13 to December 25, free ARX is rewarded simply for logging-in to the game each day. ARX acquired through this event and other promotions does not count towards the weekly ARX cap.^[4]^^[5]^

Frontier Points
 		 	 
- ARX were implemented in the September Update across all platforms on September 18, 2019.
- ARX can only be used to buy cosmetic Game Extras and will not be used to introduce and acquire pay-to-win purchases.^[1]^

- ARX is based on Frontier Points, a virtual currency that *Elite Dangerous*players on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 platforms had to purchase in order to acquire items from the Frontier Store. Frontier Points could be purchased in denominations of 300, 500, 1000, and 2500. PC players did not use Frontier Points, and were able to purchase items from the Frontier Store directly.
    - When the September Update was implemented, unspent Frontier Points were automatically exchanged for ARX at a conversion rate of 1:20.^[7]^
