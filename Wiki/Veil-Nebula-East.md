The **Veil Nebula East**, also called the Eastern Veil orÂ Caldwell 33, is a nebula in the Inner Orion Spur. It lies 525LY away from Sol. Created from the same exploding star as the Veil Nebula West, the Veil Nebula has lost the blue hues of her sister. Together, these nebulae form the Cygnus Loop. Although they have been heavily explored over the last 500 years, not all explorations have returned, and salvage is readily available.
