# Planets
There are two main categories of **planets**: Terrestrial Planets and Gas Giants. Some types of Terrestrial Planets support lifeforms or meet the conditions for terraforming. Ships equipped with the Planetary Approach Suite may land on the surface of Terrestrial Planets with 0 to tenuous (0.01-0.10) atmospheres. Some planets have a planetary ring system.

The term planet refers to a celestial body that orbits a star with a gravity in a specific range. The gravity of a planet must be strong enough to hold fluids and plastic solids in a stable state (hydrostatic equilibrium) which prevents them from escaping the planet and it makes the body round, and low enough to prevent stellar nuclear processes to start.

Some astronomical objects that meet the official criteria for planet status yet also orbit a planet are instead classified as natural satellites or moons. When the barycentre of the planet-moon system falls outside the planet, then both bodies are considered planets and part of a double-planet system.^[1]^

| Icy body | *Ice world composed mainly of water ice.

| Rocky Ice World | *Typically formed in the cooler regions of a star system these worlds have a small metal core and thick rocky mantle with a crust of very deep ice.

## Gas Giants

| Type | Description | Rarity | Image |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Class I gas giant | *Class I or Jovian gas giants have primarily hydrogen and helium atmospheres. Colouration comes from clouds in the upper atmosphere of ammonia, water vapour, hydrogen sulphide, phosphine and sulphur. The temperature at the top of their upper cloud layers is typically less than 150 K.* | Common | [![Class I gas giant Wredguia HY-G c24-12 1](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/67/Class_I_gas_giant_Wredguia_HY-G_c24-12_1.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20210910055843)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/6/67/Class_I_gas_giant_Wredguia_HY-G_c24-12_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20210910055843) 	 		 			 		 		 		 	  	 	[![Class I gas giant HIP 53248 AB 4](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/1c/Class_I_gas_giant_HIP_53248_AB_4.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20210924015644)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/1/1c/Class_I_gas_giant_HIP_53248_AB_4.png/revision/latest?cb=20210924015644) |

| Class III gas giant | *Class III gas giants have primarily hydrogen and helium atmospheres without distinctive cloud layers. Their surface temperature typically ranges between 350 K and 800 K. They are primarily blue in colour because of optical scattering in the atmosphere - with the chance of wispy cloud layers from sulphides and chlorides.* | Common | [![Class III gas giant HIP 99152 1 a](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/76/Class_III_gas_giant_HIP_99152_1_a.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20210911005700)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/7/76/Class_III_gas_giant_HIP_99152_1_a.png/revision/latest?cb=20210911005700) 	 		 			 		 		 		 	  	 	[![Class III gas giant 35 Ursae Majoris 1](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/e/ee/Class_III_gas_giant_35_Ursae_Majoris_1.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20210924030531)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/e/ee/Class_III_gas_giant_35_Ursae_Majoris_1.png/revision/latest?cb=20210924030531) |
| Class IV gas giant | *Class IV gas giants have primarily hydrogen and helium atmospheres with carbon monoxide and upper clouds of alkali metals above lower cloud layers of silicates and iron compounds, hence the brighter colours. The temperature of their upper cloud layers is typically above 900 K.* | Rare

| Class V gas giant | *Class V gas giants have primarily hydrogen and helium atmospheres, with thick clouds of silicates and iron compounds, even metallic iron.They are the hottest type of gas giants with temperatures at their upper cloud decks above 1400 K, and much hotter in the lower layers, often emitting a dull glow from the internal heat within.* | Rare

| Helium-rich | *Helium-rich gas giants have a greatly inflated percentage of helium compared to the hydrogen in their atmosphere. Much of their hydrogen has been lost over time because they have insufficient mass to hold on to it. It may also be because temperatures in their past were much higher, driving off the hydrogen at a greater rate.* | Very Rare | [![Helium-rich Gas Giant 2](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/57/Helium-rich_Gas_Giant_2.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20150624061019)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/5/57/Helium-rich_Gas_Giant_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20150624061019) |
| Helium gas giant | *Helium gas giants have primarily a helium atmosphere. They have lost most or all of their hydrogen because they have insufficient mass to hold on to it over time. It may also be because temperatures in their past were much higher, driving off the hydrogen at a greater rate.* | Extremely Rare

| Gas giant with ammonia-based life | *Gas giant with ammonia-based life. This is primarily a hydrogen and helium-based atmospheric gas giant, but a little below the surface cloud layers, life exists based in the ammonia-cloud layer. The chemistry of this gaseous region is far from equilibrium, with a surprising excess of oxygen and many carbon-based compounds giving it some vivid colours. As with many such gaseous living systems, it is underpinned by vast quantities of free-floating radioplankton - tiny carbon-based algae, each retaining a small quantity of liquid ammonia, extracting their energy from the intense radiation flux.* | Uncommon | [![Gas giant with ammonia-based life Wredguia EP-K b37-0 3](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/3/3e/Gas_giant_with_ammonia-based_life_Wredguia_EP-K_b37-0_3.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20210929020625)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/3/3e/Gas_giant_with_ammonia-based_life_Wredguia_EP-K_b37-0_3.png/revision/latest?cb=20210929020625) |

| Water Giant | *Water giant. Worlds like this have a large atmosphere made mainly of water vapour. It most likely formed when a large icy body warmed up enough to evaporate a large amount of its surface ice, this would in turn trigger a runaway greenhouse effect leading to a very thick atmosphere made of the evaporated ices.* | Rare | [![Water Giant](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/f/f7/Water_Giant.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20150212022545)](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/elite-dangerous/images/f/f7/Water_Giant.png/revision/latest?cb=20150212022545) |
