### Type

Pilots Federation service

### Purpose

Search and Rescue

The **Pilots Federation Rescue Rangers** are a division of the Pilots Federation that is responsible for rescuing commanders who suffer a critical injury or the loss of their ship anywhere in the galaxy. This service is free for all licensed members of the Pilots Federation, but does not cover any insurance costs, and the rescued commander forfeits any items in their suit backpack, any commodities in their cargo hold, and any unredeemed missions, vouchers, and exploration scan data.

After a rescued commander has recovered from their injuries, they must review an Incident Report and decide whether or not to pay insurance and recover their lost ship, as well as choose where to Redeploy.

## Notes

- The Pilots Federation Rescue Rangers were first mentioned in *Elite Dangerous: Odyssey*. Before this, while it had been established that players were always rescued when they lost their ship, the organisation responsible for this service had not been identified.
