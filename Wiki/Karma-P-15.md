## Overview

The Karma P-15 is the first weapon owned by all commanders. As a kinetic weapon, it is fairly weak against shielded targets, but still useful against unshielded targets. It is recommended to equip one of Takada's laser weapons to take down an opponent's shields, then finish them off with the P-15.
