**Mass Manager** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to Frame Shift Drives through Engineering. It increases the FSD's optimised mass value by 4% to boost overall jump range, at the expense of reduced integrity by 8%. 

Mass Manager is most beneficial for Class 5 and higher FSDs; for Class 4 and lower FSDs, Deep Charge is more suitable. It is recommended for explorers and ships with low jump range.

## Applicability

The effect is available for the following modules:

- Frame Shift Drive

## Required Materials

- 5x Atypical Disrupted Wake Echoes
- 3x Galvanising Alloys
- 1x Eccentric Hyperspace Trajectories
