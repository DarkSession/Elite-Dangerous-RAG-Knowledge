**Lucan Onionhead** is a Legal Drug Rare Commodity exclusively sold by the starport Cassie-L-Peia in the Tanmark system. It is considered illegal in some systems, and transporting it can result in a fine or bounty if scanned by system security.

Lucan Onionhead was the second strain of the controversial drug Onionhead to be developed. Samples of Onionhead were smuggled out of Kappa Fornacis, which had been blockaded by the Federal Navy, to the planet Luca in Tanmark by the Kappa Fornacis Farmers Union, and then used to create a new strain of the drug that temporarily circumvented Federal legal restrictions by taking advantage of a loophole. It went on sale for the first time in January 3301.^[1]^
