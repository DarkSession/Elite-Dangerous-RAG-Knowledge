The **Corrosion Resistant Cargo Rack (CRCR)** is a unique Cargo Rack that can be used to safely transport corrosive objects such as Thargoid Sensors, Thargoid Probes, Thargoid Links, and Thargoid Interceptor Tissue Samples without accumulating damage to the player's ship. They were created using a new material developed by Professor Lea Tantaga from Meta-Alloys.^[1]^^[2]^

## Unlocking

Class 1 modules are exclusively sold at two locations: Abel Laboratory on Arque 4 e and Cinder Dock on Shenve A 6, the workshops of the Engineers Ishmael Palin and Chloe Sedesi, respectively.

Class 4 modules can be unlocked through a Human Technology Broker, and are then available for purchase at any station where a Human Technology Broker is present. Unlocking requires the following Materials:

- 16 Meta-Alloys
- 26 Iron
- 18 Chemical Manipulators
- 22 Radiation Baffle
- 12 Neofabric Insulation

Class 5 and 6 modules exist in limited numbers among commanders received as a CG reward^[3]^, but are otherwise neither purchasable nor unlockable.

## Notes

- 1E and 1F Corrosion Resistant Cargo Racks were created via an 8-tier Community Goal.^[1]^^[2]^ Higher-capacity versions of the module were potential rewards in the CG, but only tier 4 was unlocked when the CG concluded.^[4]^ At the time, the only use Corrosion Resistant Cargo Racks had was for transporting Thargoid Sensors (then labeled "Unknown Artefacts") to sell at blackmarkets. Larger 4E Corrosion Resistant Cargo Racks were later added by Beyond Chapter One (3.0). On November 29, 2018, the deleterious effects of selling Thargoid Sensors were removed, allowing Thargoid commodities to be legally sold at station markets and increasing the viability of Corrosion Resistant Cargo Racks as a tool for traders.^[5]^^[6]^
