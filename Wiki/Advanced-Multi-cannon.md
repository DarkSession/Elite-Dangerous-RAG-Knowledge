The **Advanced Multi-cannon** is a weapon module with a unique configurable ammunition system based on Guardian technology. It was developed by the minor faction Zende Partners of the Zende system as part of the Bridging the Gap Interstellar Initiative.^[1]^ By default, the Advanced Multi-cannon is identical in terms of both performance and cost to a standard Multi-cannon, and also fires the same small calibre ammunition. The Advanced Multi-cannon's key feature is that Anti-Xeno ammunition can be Synthesized for it on the fly, allowing the weapon to be used in combat situations against Thargoid vessels as well as human ones. Unlike dedicated Anti-Xeno weapons, the Advanced Multi-cannon does not have experimental weapon restrictions, allowing pilots to equip as many as their ships can accommodate.^[2]^^[3]^
