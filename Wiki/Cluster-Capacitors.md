**Cluster Capacitors** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to Power Distributors through Engineering. It increases power capacity at the cost of power recharge rate.

This effect is not recommended for use in conjunction with the Charge Enhanced Power Distributor modification, as its effect is the opposite of the upgrade.

## Applicability

This effect is available for the following modules:

- Power Distributor

## Materials Required

- 5x Phosphorus
- 3x Heat Resistant Ceramics
- 1x Cadmium
