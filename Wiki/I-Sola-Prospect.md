**i Sola Prospect** is a Planetary Outpost on planet Brestla A 1 in the Brestla system. It is the only Planetary Outpost to offer all modules and ships for sale, but all prices are 20% higher than usual due to the expense of transporting so much stock to a port directly under the influence of planetary gravity. i Sola Prospect gained this distinctive feature through a successful Community Goal to upgrade its facilities in 3302.^[1]^

## Timeline

05 FEB 3302

- Mavia Kain, leader of the Imperial Inquisition, has announced that the group's campaign to develop the planetary outpost of i Sola Prospect on Brestla A1 has been enthusiastically received by the galactic community. Members of the organisation were motivated to launch the campaign after becoming frustrated with i Sola Prospect's limited service options. Having received significant quantities of material, the organisation is now in a position to begin developing the outpost. A spokesperson for the group released a statement to the media: "Mavia Kain and the Imperial Inquisition would like to thank the galactic community for its support. Thanks to you, i Sola Prospect will soon be the best-equipped planetary outpost in the galaxy, rivalled only by Jameson Memorial." Improvements to the outpost are expected to begin immediately.^[2]^

28 JAN 3302 

- The Imperial Inquisition is known for regularly organising competitive combat events, ranging from small-scale skirmishes to the popular 'Hunter Games', an intense 20-person gladiatorial competition. As one might expect, members of the organisation make frequent use of outfitting services, but they are constrained by the fact that their nearest outpost offers only a limited range of options. That's why the faction has launched a campaign to develop its local outpost of i Sola Prospect on Brestla A1. Central to the initiative is a request for industrial materials, which the Imperial Inquisition will use to upgrade the outpost. A spokesperson for the group released a brief statement: "Developing i Sola Prospect will mean that every type of weapon, ship and component needed to deliver the ultimate entertainment experience is always available. Naturally this will also be a huge boon to the galactic community." If the campaign is successful, i Sola Prospect will become the first planetary outpost to boast a complete range of services, including a comprehensive shipyard.^[3]^

## Notes

- Although i Sola Prospect is not the first port to offer all modules and ships, it is the only one located in a system that is not permit-locked. Other systems with fully-stocked ports include Shinrarta Dezhra and CD-43 11917, both of which require permits with relatively steep requirements.
