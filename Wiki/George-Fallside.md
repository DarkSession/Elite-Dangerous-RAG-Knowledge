Congressman
Non-Executive Director of Core Dynamics and other corporations

**George Fallside** is a Federal Congressman and a non-executive director of Core Dynamics and several other major arms manufacturers. It has never been proven, but it is believed that Fallside was somehow involved in the assassination of Vice President Nigel Smeaton in January 3301 and the alleged cover-up that led to deaths of Federal Times reporter Elaine Boyd and Presidential Protection Detail agent Susan Monroe in August 3301.

## Timeline

23 APR 3302

- Imperial investigator Cornelius Gendymion has released a statement to the Prism Herald addressing accusations that Imperial agents were responsible for the destruction of Starship One. "It seems Federal Times reporter Elaine Boyd's investigations are being ignored by her countrymen. You may recall that she highlighted the suspicious deaths of key individuals involved in both the Antares and Starship One investigations before her alleged suicide. Her data detailed an off-the-books investigation into the Antares by Vice-President Nigel Smeaton, and also alleged that he was murdered. Congressman George Fallside's apparent foreknowledge of Smeaton's death was waved away, but I suspect Jacob Harris might have better luck finding Starship One's saboteurs if he searched within the Federation â€“ perhaps starting with folks who have ties to Core Dynamics."

- Yesterday's revelations from the Federal Times concerning an alleged connection between a high ranking member of the Core Dynamics board and the Highliner Antares incident have finally prompted an official response from the ship manufacturer. "Core Dynamics takes the safety of space flight very seriously and would never deliberately act to jeopardise our own or any other corporations' development. It is hard to accept that anyone from our company would act in such a manner. Given the gravity of the accusations the accused non-executive board member has agreed to step aside while we investigate. We have requested that the Federal Times share their information with us so that a full investigation into the matter can be carried out." Congressman George Fallside is the only named person in the article. When asked about the Congressman's connection with the company and his apparent knowledge of the Vice President's death before it had been announced the spokesman responded: "Any impropriety by any member of the board will be fully investigated. I cannot comment on Vice President Nigel Smeaton's death. My understanding it that has already been investigated by the relevant authorities." The Chief Editor for the Federal Times confirmed that they would share the information they had with the Sirius Corporation, Core Dynamics and appropriate law enforcement agencies.^[2]^

- In another shocking revelation the Federal Times today posted a story highlighting possible links between a non-exec member of the board of Core Dynamics and Vice President Nigel Smeaton's death. They first referenced an interview on January 28th with Congressman George Fallside who appeared to have early knowledge of the Vice President's death. The Congressman refused to comment on the article, but it is public knowledge of his non-executive directorship of Core Dynamics and several other major arms manufacturers. More damning was the evidence concerning one of the crew of the Starship One, Flight Engineer Nick Baron, who had previously worked at Core Dynamics before joining the President's Crew. From the information package sent by Elaine Boyd after her death, the Federal Times published extracts of financial records of the flight engineer. When tracing these records through a convoluted series of transfers, one of these transfers was through a shell corporation in which Congressman Fallside was involved. The trail of the payments revealed that Boyd must have obtained a high level clearance access, possibly provided by Agent Monroe. When asked about today's story, the Chief Editor for the Federal Times commented: "There does appear to have been a conspiracy on several levels. We believe that the destruction of the Highliner Antares so many years ago may not have been an accident. When the Vice President was investigating the death of his relative, he must have discovered some of these details, and possible the dark forces killed him, and when our reporter Elaine Boyd did the same, she too was silenced. We are still not clear how it relates to the present day. Our reporters continue to investigate. At the Federal Times we always seek the truth and we will discover the truth here."^[3]^

28 JAN 3301

- The press furore over the death of the Federal Vice President has been given a new burst of life, after a recording of a local constituency meeting was released on the scurrilous news channel 'The Low Down'. In the otherwise low-key meeting held in a village outside Quenisset, Mars, on January 12th, the local mayor offered his condolences to the family and friends of a local businessman murdered during a robbery earlier in the week. George Fallside, the local Congressman, was present at the meeting. The Congressman, who was clearly distracted by social media at the time of the meeting, followed the mayor's speech by offering his condolences to the Vice President's family. This was an hour after the VP's death, but half an hour before the news of his death broke. The Congressman was not available for comment, but an aide has said - "Is it a big deal? He clearly misheard what was said." On 'The Low Down' they followed up by emphasising the Congressman's links with the military, and in particularly his non-exec directorship of Core Dynamics.^[4]^
