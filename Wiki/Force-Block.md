**Force Block** is an Experimental Effect that can be applied to Shield Boosters through Engineering. Depending on the module, Force Block has different effects. For Shield Boosters, it increases kinetic resistance by +2% at the cost of -1% optimal strength. For Shield Generators, it increases kinetic resistance by +8% at the cost of -3% optimal multiplier.
