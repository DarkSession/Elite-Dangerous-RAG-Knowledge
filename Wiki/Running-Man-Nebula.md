Running Man Nebula
 		 	 

When one wants to visit all the places of interest in the Barnard's Loop Region, the **Running Man Nebula** is one of most important and noticeable ones. It partially blends into the Orion Nebula, but is strikingly different in color. Like Witch's Head, it seems to be mostly bright purple from the outside, with a bar of dark cold gas in the center.
