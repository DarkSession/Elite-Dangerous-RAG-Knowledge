CMDR **Dylan Sylke** is a Pilots Federation-certified pilot and mercenary in an unidentified group. He owns a Cobra MkIV named *The Sylke Worm*, callsign A-03. Sylke personally oversees a colleague's final mission to complete their term of service in the mercenary group in order to leave and become a certified commander themselves. This mission involves infiltrating Briscoe's Landing, a military outpost settlement on the moon Phaeacia in BD-02 5286 operated by the Pilots Federation Local Branch that has been raided by criminals, to obtain NOC Data. Once the mission is complete, Sylke transports his colleague to Chamberlain's Rest in HIP 97950 and cuts them loose.^[1]^
