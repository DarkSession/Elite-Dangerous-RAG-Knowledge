Hi'iaka, a moon of Haumea
 		 	 

**Hi'iaka** is a moon of the dwarf planet Haumea, and the outermost moon in the Sol system. It is about 320 km in diameter, or slightly smaller than the asteroid 10 Hygiea.

Hi'iaka is covered in ice, and is believed to have formed along with Haumea after a larger celetial body was shattered by an impact. Hi'iaka was discovered on 26 January, 2005 by the telescopes at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.^[1]^

## Notes

- In Hawaiian mythology, Hi'iaka is the goddess of dance and one of the daughters of Haumea, the goddess of childbirth. She is the patron goddess of Big Island of Hawaii.
