Barnard's Loop
 		 	 

**Barnard's Loop** is an immense nebula in the Inner Orion Spur named after the pioneering astrophotographer Edward Emerson Barnard; Barnard documented the gas cloud in 1894, though it was also likely observed by earlier astronomers. It is approximately 300 light years across, and is thought to have originated from a supernova two million years ago. The stars AE Aurigae, Mu Columbae, and 53 Arietis are believed to have been byproducts of the supernova.

In the 34th century, Barnard's Loop is one of the most ubiquitous visual features in space visible from the Core Systems. Many explorers make a point of visiting it, and the Trapezium Sector AF-Z c0 system is one of several ideal observation spots.
