## History

After a period of retreat from the Core Systems during the Second Thargoid War, the Thargoids launched a major assault on Deciat on June 28, 3304. The surge in Thargoid activity was detected by Eagle Eye. Admiral Aden Tanner of Aegis explained that the Thargoids' apparent retreat had likely only been a pause to regroup with reinforcements from the Pleiades Nebula.^[1]^ The incursion in Deciat also marked the first appearance of three variants of Thargoid Scouts: the Berserker, the Regenerator, and the Inciter. Thargoid vessels continued to appear in Deciat for years after the initial assault was defeated by independent pilots.
