Fungoida Bullarum - Red
 		 	 

> 
> 
> Organisms that live deep inside a planetary substrate. They share similar morphology to fungi but are not saprophytic, instead their mycelial body drives its metabolism through chemosynthetic and thermosynthetic processes. These are facilitated by substrate, which also protects the organism from environmental extremes. The exposed aspects of the organisms are primarily involved in reproduction. This is frequently through spore ejection, but certain species also support gaseous exchange with the atmosphere. Some fungoida exhibit bioluminescent behaviours as a part of a metabolic process involved in the breakdown of accumulated toxins.

**Fungoida** is a genome of alien organism found on planets and moons with thin atmospheres across the galaxy. They can be sampled with the Genetic Sampler and scanned with the Short Range Composition Scanner. They have a clonal colony range of 300m.

## Description

Fungoida are named after their fungus-like appearance. They are only known to grow on the sides of large mountains, where they can often be found among clusters of other biologicals such as Frutexa. They are very small; recognizable with Night Vision from 200m.^[1]^

## Types

There are four known types of Fungoida with differing base values:

| SPECIES | VALUE |
| --- | --- |
| Fungoida Bullarum | 3,703,200 |
| Fungoida Gelata | 3,330,300 |
| Fungoida Setisis | 1,670,100 |
| Fungoida Stabitis | 2,680,300 |

## Distance

Minimum distance between two genetic samples: 300 m

## Conditions of occurrence

- Planets with thin atmosphere
- Maximum gravity: 0.27

| ATMOSPHERE TYPE | SPECIES |

### Description

*A fungoida that features clusters of mottled bubble-shaped growths atop a central stalk. These contain spores that can be exposed to the winds to facilitate distribution.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planets with thin Argon or Argon-rich atmosphere
- Maximum gravity: 0.27

### Colored variants

Colored variant determined by rare material found on planet:

| MATERIAL | COLOR |
| --- | --- |
| Antinomy | Red |
| Polonium | Mulberry |
| Ruthenium | Magenta |
| Technetium | Peach |
| Tellurium | Gold |
| Yttrium | Orange |

## Fungoida gelata

CMDR Tiberius Vaako, Fungoida gelata, Preae Theia LA-L b35-0 A6A
 		 	 

### Description

*This fungoida species resembles an upturned jellyfish, emerging from a solid base buried within the substrate. The exposed part is dominated by fleshy reproductive organisms that shed organic tissue. This tissue can float on the light breeze and form a new organism if it lands in the right location.*

### Conditions of occurrence

- Planets with thin Carbon Dioxide or Water atmosphere
- Maximum gravity: 0.27
- For Carbon Dioxide atmospheres, mean temperature between 180 K and 195 K

### Colored variants

Colored variant determined by rare material found on planet:

| MATERIAL | COLOR |
| --- | --- |
| Cadmium | Cyan |
| Mercury | Lime |
| Molybdenum | Mulberry |
| Niobium | Green |
| Tungsten | Orange |
| Tin | Red |

## Fungoida setisis
