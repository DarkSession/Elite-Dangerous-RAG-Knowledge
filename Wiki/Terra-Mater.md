**Terra Mater** is an independent system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. The system is permit-locked, and the permit can be obtained by becoming Allied with the Brotherhood of Terra Mater minor faction in any system where it has a presence. The Rare Commodity Terra Mater Blood Bores can be purchased at Gr8minds when the Brotherhood of Terra Mater is in control of it.

The Brotherhood of Terra Mater faction was one of 14 permit-holding factions that entered into an agreement on November 24, 3307 to maintain so-called Gatekeeper megaships to preserve interstellar trade regardless of local political shifts. These Gatekeeper megaships would be permanently stationed in systems adjacent to their corresponding permit-locked systems to ensure that pilots could reliably obtain permits. Daunting Hammer was deployed in Hecate as the Brotherhood of Terra Mater's Gatekeeper megaship.^[1]^
