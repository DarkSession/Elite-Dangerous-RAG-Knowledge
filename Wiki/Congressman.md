# Congressman
A **Congressman** is an individual who has been elected and inducted into the Federal Congress in Olympus Village on Mars. The term is used to refer to both male and female members of Federal Congress. Congressmen represent a particular constituency which may be multiple star systems, one star system or smaller states within one of the oldest Federal systems. Unlike in the other superpowers' legislative bodies, congressmen are expected to be physically present to vote.^[1]^ The number of congressmen has been limited to 500 members since 2594, when Congress approved a law to streamline its structure; before this, every Federal member state was entitled to its own congressman, which excessively slowed down Congress's ability to make decisions.^[2]^

Congressmen are elected for an eight year term by the citizens of the Federation, with a "vote of no confidence" after four years. If the vote of no confidence succeeds then a new election takes place and the member of Congress can be replaced or re-elected. Congressmen are barred from serving multiple consecutive terms. A congressman can become President immediately after their term.^[1]^^[3]^

They can also hold other office such as chairing committees. They are not allowed to have corporate interests that conflict with their political roles.^[1]^

Anyone can stand for election. They do not need to be backed by a political party or minor faction, but it helps. Corporations generally do push (and fund) their chosen candidates or parties (eg Hudson), as do other special interest groups.^[1]^
