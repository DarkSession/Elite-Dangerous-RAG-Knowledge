**LTT 198** is an Imperial system in the Core Systems within the Inner Orion Spur. The system is permit-locked, and the permit can be obtained by becoming Allied with the Torval Mining Ltd minor faction in EGM 559.

In August 3307, rival corporations Torval-Mastopolos Mining and Wreaken Construction established temporary local headquarters in LTT 198 on the planet Dini, allegedly after they each paid LTT 198 State Ltd exorbitant fees to acquire the system's permit. Both corporations deployed megaships, the Pride of Bitterwood and Tobias's Gift, respectively, to the system to host competing mining campaigns that would determine which business would retain a permanent presence in the system.^[1]^^[2]^ Torval-Mastopolos Mining triumphed and subsequently constructed a new Orbis starport to serve as its permanent administrative headquarters; Torval Orbital opened on September 3, 3307.^[3]^^[4]^ On October 1, 3307, Torval-Mastopolos Mining was elected the new controlling faction of LTT 198 and secured the system's permit holder rights from LTT 198 State Ltd.^[5]^ On October 8, Torval-Mastopolos Mining formally split from its parent corporation, Mastopolos Mining, and was rebranded Torval Mining Ltd.^[6]^

Torval Mining Ltd was one of 14 permit-holding factions that entered into an agreement on November 24, 3307 to maintain so-called Gatekeeper megaships to preserve interstellar trade regardless of local political shifts. These Gatekeeper megaships would be permanently stationed in systems adjacent to their corresponding permit-locked systems to ensure that pilots could reliably obtain permits. Orchestral Falcon was deployed in Tavgi as Torval Mining Ltd's Gatekeeper megaship.^[7]^
