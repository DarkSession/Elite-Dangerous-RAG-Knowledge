# Speeding
Travelling at speeds in excess of 100 m/s within the no-fire zone of a starport is considered reckless and dangerous to other space-faring traffic. The warning text "Speeding" will be displayed on your HUD if your speed is excessive.

While no penalties will be incurred for speeding in itself, if you collide with another ship while speeding then fines or bounties will be incurred.

Shields only collisions above speed limit cause a fine.

Hull damage only above speed limit causes a larger fine.

Ship destruction within short window of time after a collision above speed limit causes a fine and counts as killing. This means that by ramming, bounty vouchers can be collected for killing a criminal (while still getting a fine, too!) and you will get a bounty yourself if you ram a clean person to death.

Colliding with stations does not incur any penalty.
