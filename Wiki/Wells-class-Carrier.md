The Bright Sentinel, a Wells-class Carrier
 		 	 

The **Wells-class Carrier**,^[1]^^[2]^ also called the **Wells-class Megaship**,^[3]^ is a type of Flight Operations Carrier megaship. Cheaper and more mobile than larger stations, yet still able to offer almost all normal port services with the exception of Shipyards, Wells-class Carriers are commonly used to rapidly establish a presence in a system and support smaller ships. While most of these megaships remain stationary once deployed, some will occasionally relocate to another system as needed, and a few are also used as ferries and make regularly scheduled jumps between certain systems.

One key difference between Wells-class Carriers and other types of Flight Operations Carrier megaships is that the former feature standard public  Concourses.^[3]^ Detention Centres have a unique Concourse design to fit their role as places of incarceration for criminals, while Rescue Vessels lack Concourses of any kind.
