# AXI Progression Rank Grading Scorecard & Rubric      

| **Category** | F | C | B | A | S | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Ship Build** | Ship Build CMDR will not listen to common build advice. CMDR will try to fly off-meta ships from the get-go, without a core understanding of the ideas behind different builds, and/or CMDR insists on fighting in unengineered ships | Commander has a resonably-engineered beginner (often shielded) ship | CMDR has a recommended "meta" ship, with potentially some shortcomings (e.g., not fully-engineered HRPs). But the "key" internals are all G5 (distro, thrusters, PP) | CMDR has at least one fully-engineered meta ship (Krait, FAS, Chally, shieldless chieftain and/or AX cutter) | CMDR has learned to intentionally deviate from the Meta to suit specific goals, and may have gone further in actually contributing to the evolution of the meta. At this level, it's common to have a few core "meta" ships, and several off-meta ones for specific purposes | 10% |
| **Cold Orbiting** | CMDR will fail to use heatsinks reliably and/or will not even orbit at all | CMDR has a basic ability to at least partially orbit. Sink coverage can be spotty (missed sinks); orbits often stall; range control isn't good - often jousting the goid; boost control is poor - CMDR may consistently "boost into" the goid | CMDR has an intermediate mastery of cold orbiting - orbits will still stall but not too frequently. Sink coverage is very good - missed sinks are rare. Range control is barely acceptable, with orbits in the 2-2.5km range common. | CMDR has a solid command of cold orbiting. Orbits rarely stall. Range control can still be spotty - orbits can swing between 1000-2500m frequently. Sink coverage is near-perfect | CMDR has mastered "basic" cold orbiting and has further learned boost-orbiting. Orbits almost never stall. CMDR proactively sinks, and may double (or even triple) sink by design if it suits the build/goal. Range control is exceptional - CMDR is rarely seen beyond 1.5km when firing. | 25% |
| **Aim, fire discipline, and fire style** | CMDR will over-correct and not be able to consistently hit hearts, especially in FA off. Fire discipline is off - CMDR may spike heat and/or have very low fire rate. CMDR will typically not stagger shots | CMDR can often hit the goid and exert, but typically has issues sniping hearts, especially in FA off. Accuracy range is &lt;50%. Fire cycle can be 3s and above. CMDR may stagger shots, but will typically do so alternating fire groups vs truly overlapping shots. | CMDR has semi-reliable aim and can semi-consistently snipe heart. Accuracy range is around 50-60%. Fire cadence is good but not optimal, with fire cycle about 2.5-3s. CMDR has learned to overlap staggered fire. | CMDR has solid and consistent aim. Accuracy range is 60-80%. Fire cadence is very good - CMDR can approach capacitor limit of 2m2s 6A CE capacitor firing (2210ms w/ one sink active). CMDR has a solid command of staggered fire - with good overlap. | CMDR has exceptional aim. Accuracy range 80-100%. Fire cadence has been optimized to the millisecond limit of their power distributor (or the lower limit of the 2050ms gauss cycle), and near-perfect overlap on stagger. | 25% |
| **PIP management** | CMDR has little PIP management awareness and will often be found to have cap problems e.g., firing gauss with no PIPs to WEP | CMDR understands the basics of PIP management but will often be found out-of-config during runs | CMDR can reliably use PIPs to suit situations, and may have PIP macros built to help; CMDR may still fall pray of occasional mistakes (e.g., running out of SYS and not being able to fire sinks as a consequence) | CMDR has a strong command of PIP mgmt, and will consitently be in the appropriate configuration for the phase of the fight | CMDR has total control on PIP management, switching as appropriate, even mid-run | 10% |
| **Swarm management and situational awareness** | CMDR will often be "surprised" by the goid and take damage in non-exertion phases. CMDR will consistently let swarm fly through them (and eat missiles as a result.) CMDR will be missing most of their flak shots. | Flak shots are somewhat consistent, but significant flak ammo/shots are required to take down even ball-formation swarms. | CMDR can reliably shoot down "ball formation" swarms but has trouble with ring formations. CMDR will still let swarm fly through them, and isn't able to tell missile vs basic formations apart visually. | CMDR can flak down any swarm formation with little trouble. CMDR has learned to visually identify swarm formation types, and will actively "reset" missile formations when appropriate. Swarm rarely "flies through" the CMDR. If shieldless, CMDR has mastered use of Silent Running to do flybys and to minimize damage when sinks aren't an option and/or can be conserved. If shielded, CMDR has mastered cold reboots. | CMDR has mastered swarm management. If using flak, CMDR can shred most swarm formations in seconds. If flakless, CMDR can reliably boost-orbit while keeping the swarm in check and avoiding agitating it. Furthermore, CMDR is comfortable actively baiting missiles when appropriate, including during enrage. | 15% |
| **Tactical decision-making and time management** | CMDR will consistently engage even when odds of success are low (out of sinks, low hull, ...). CMDR will rarely disengage even when e.g., canopy about to be breached. CMDR will consistently face enraged goids "timing out" | CMDR lacks a core understanding of engage timing, and may face enraged goids frequently, while failing to disengage occasionally when the situation would call for it | CMDR will be making appropriate tactical decisions in more common scenarios, but can make poor choices under pressure (e.g., when fighting enrage, when faced with a bail-or-reexert choice). CMDR can still make poor tactical choices (e.g., turning away and try to run once grabbed by lightning vs using opportunity to finish sniping a heart) | CMDR is generally aware of his/her limits and the limits of their ship. They will generally make appropriate choices in battle, even under pressure | CMDR has mastered not only the basics of a progression fight, but is now actively putting pressure on the goid with advanced techniques like e.g., ramming shields. While occasional mistakes will always be a thing, at this level CMDRs can make split-second choices that can salvage apparently lost situations. | 15% |
